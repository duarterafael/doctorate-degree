The 40 Hz sound was generated via https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/. That was played via "stereo mix" (open the "sound control panel" and enable it).
Then, Audacity was used (along with "stereo mix" as the source) to record the sound from the website as it was played.
Audacity was then used to export it as a .wav file.

The radiolab show on 40Hz is at https://www.diytdcs.com/tag/40hz/.
