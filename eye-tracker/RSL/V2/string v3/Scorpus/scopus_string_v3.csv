Activities (tasks) are arranged together into a model (i.e., similar to flowcharts). This study aimed at understanding the underlying structure of PM comprehension. Though standards for describing PM have been defined, the cognitive work load they evoke, their structure, and the efficacy of information transmission are only partially understood. Two studies were conducted to better differentiate the concept of visual literacy (VL) and logical reasoning in interpreting PM. Study I: A total of 1047 students from 52 school classes were assessed. Three different process models of increasing complexity were presented on tablets. Additionally, written labels of the models’ elements were randomly allocated to scholars in a 3-group between-subjects design. Comprehension of process models was assessed by a series of 3 × 4 (=12) dichotomous test items. Latent Class Analysis of solved items revealed 6 qualitatively differing solution patterns, suggesting that a single test score is insufficient to reflect participants’ performance. Study II: Overall, 21 experts and 15 novices with respect to visual literacy were presented the same set of PMs as in Study I, while wearing eye tracking glasses. The fixation duration on relevant parts of the PM and on questions were recorded, as well as the total time needed to solve all 12 test items. The number of gaze transitions between process model and comprehension questions was measured as well. Being an expert in visual literacy did not alter the capability of correctly understanding graphical logical PMs. Presenting PMs that are labelled by single letters had a significant influence on reducing the time spent on irrelevant model parts but did not affect the fixation duration on relevant areas of interest. Both samples’ participants required longer response times with increasing model complexity. The number of toggles (i.e., gaze transitions between model and statement area of interest) was predictive for membership in one of the latent classes. Contrary to expectations, denoting the PM events and decisions not with real-world descriptions, but with single letters, led to lower cognitive workload in responding to comprehension questions and to better results. Visual Literacy experts could neither outperform novices nor high-school students in comprehending PM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business process model; Cognitive workload; Eye tracking; Latent class analysis; Visual literacy","Structural design; Business process model; Cognitive workloads; Dichotomous test items; High school students; Information transmission; Latent class analysis; Real-world descriptions; Visual literacy; Eye tracking",,,,,"01JK1606A","This work was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Science (grant number: 01JK1606A ).",,,"Aguilar-Saven, R.S., Business process modelling: Review and framework (2004) International Journal of Production Economics, 90 (2), pp. 129-149; Andersen, E.B., A goodness of fit test for the Rasch model (1973) Psychometrika, 38, pp. 123-140; Andrà, C., Arzarello, F., Ferrara, F., Holmqvist, K., Lindström, P., Robutti, O., How students read mathematical representations: An eye tracking study (2009) Proceedings of the 33rd conference of the international group for the psychology of mathematics education, 2, pp. 49-56. , PME ThessalonikiGreec; Andrews, K., Zimoch, M., Reichert, M., Tallon, M., Frick, U., Pryss, R., A smart mobile assessment tool for collecting data in large-scale educational studies (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 134, pp. 67-74; Arendasy, M.E., Sommer, M., Reducing response elimination strategies enhances the construct validity of figural matrices (2013) Intelligence, 41, pp. 234-243; Asparouhov, T., Muthén, B., Using Mplus TECH11 and TECH14 to test the number of latent classes (2012) Mplus Web Notes, 14, p. 22; Avgerinou, M.D., Pettersson, R., Toward a cohesive theory of visual literacy (2011) Journal of Visual Literacy, 30, pp. 1-19; Bačić, D., Fadlalla, A., Business information visualization intellectual contributions: An integrative framework of visualization capabilities and dimensions of visual intelligence (2016) Decision Support Systems, 89, pp. 77-86; Barthet, M.F., Hanachi, C., What kind of interface for expert systems?

To enable a fine-grained analysis of process model creation based on phases or the development of phase-specific modeling support, an automatic approach to detect phases is needed. While approaches exist to automatically detect modeling and reconciliation phases based on user interactions, the detection of phases without user interactions (i.e., problem understanding, method finding, and validation) is still a problem. Exploiting a combination of user interactions and eye tracking data, this paper presents a two-step approach that is able to automatically detect the sequence of phases a modeler is engaged in during model creation. The evaluation of our approach shows promising results both in terms of quality as well as computation time demonstrating its feasibility. © 2019 The Authors","Automatic phase detection; Classification; Eye tracking; Interaction tracking; Process of process modeling; Sequence labeling","Classification (of information); Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Process engineering; Quality control; Automatic approaches; Fine-grained analysis; Learning process model; Model interaction; Phase detection; Problem understanding; Process Modeling; Sequence Labeling; Eye tracking",,,,,"Austrian Science Fund

One way to perceive these problems is to evaluate the comprehension of these models through the collection of data related to the readers’ awareness with an eye-tracking device. This device allows collecting data of specific facial reactions of the people, such as the movement of the eyes and dilation of the pupils and the number of blinks in a specified time interval. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of researches that evaluate the understanding of process models through eye-tracking techniques. A systematic mapping study was developed to achieve this goal, following the best practices in the area of Software Engineering.

Then we present our experiment investigating the effect of rule linking, a specific rule integration approach which uses graphical links to connect process model symbols with rules, on process model understanding. Our objective is two-fold. First, we test if linked rules can improve a model user’s understanding of business process and rules. Second, by using eye-tracking technology in the experiment, we break down the statistics to the Process Model Area, Rule Area and Question Area and see what kind of information (process model, or rules) contributes most to our hypotheses. Third, we investigate the differences between other aspects of human cognitive behaviour such as single visit time and attention switching between groups, further exploring whether linked rules can improve process model understanding. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Eye tracking; Attention switching; Business Process; Business process model; Eye tracking technologies; Integration approach; Mental effort; Process Modeling; Time efficiencies; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,,,"Wang, W.; School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of QueenslandAustralia; email: w.wang9@uq.edu.au",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,18651348,,,,"English","Lect.

To support the understandability of process models and make them accessible for end-users with different backgrounds, several hybrid representations combining different design artifacts have been proposed in the literature. This paper investigates the understandability of DCR-HR, a new hybrid process design artifact based on DCR graphs. Using eye-tracking and think-aloud techniques, this paper explores the benefits and challenges associated with the use of different design artifacts and investigates the way end-users engage with them. The results motivate the use of DCR-HR and provide insights about the support it provides to end-users with different backgrounds. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Design; Eye tracking; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Business Process; Design artifacts; Hybrid process; Hybrid representations; Process descriptions; Process model; Requirements elicitation; Understandability; Process design",,,,,"7050-00034A

However, less experienced stakeholders (i.e., novices) face a wide range of issues when trying to read and comprehend these models. In particular, process model comprehension not only requires knowledge on process modeling notations, but also skills to visually and correctly interpret the models. In this context, many unresolved issues concerning the factors hindering process model comprehension exist and, hence, the identification of these factors becomes crucial. Using eye-tracking as an instrument, this paper presents the results obtained of a study, in which we analyzed eye-movements of novices and experts, while comprehending process models expressed in terms of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. Further, recorded eye-movements are visualized as scan paths to analyze the applied comprehension strategies. We learned that experts comprehend process models more effectively than novices. In addition, we observed particular patterns for eye-movements (e.g., back-and-forth saccade jumps) as well as different strategies of novices and experts in comprehending process models. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","(Hidden) Markov Model; Business process model comprehension; Cognition; Eye-Movement Modeling Examples; Eye-tracking","Eye tracking; Markov processes; Business process model; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Cognition; Enterprise Architecture; Eye movement model; Markov model; Novices and experts; Process Modeling; Eye movements",,,,,,,,,"Lohrmann, M., Reichert, M., Effective application of process improvement patterns to business processes (2016) Softw.

Especially for domain experts, the comprehension of process models constitutes a challenging task that needs to be mastered when creating or reading these models. This paper presents the results we obtained from an eye tracking experiment on process model comprehension. In detail, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling were confronted with models expressed in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), reflecting different levels of difficulty. The first results of this experiment confirm recent findings from one of our previous experiments on the reading and comprehension of process models. On one hand, independent from their level of expertise, all individuals face similar patterns, when being confronted with process models exceeding a certain level of difficulty. On the other, it appears that process models expressed in terms of EPCs are perceived differently compared to process models specified in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). In the end, their generalization needs to be confirmed by additional empirical experiments. The presented experiment continues a series of experiments that aim to unravel the factors fostering the comprehension of business process models by using methods and theories stemming from the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Business process model comprehension; Event-driven process chains; Eye tracking","Chains; Enterprise resource management; Neurology; Business process model; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Cognitive neurosciences; Empirical experiments; Event driven process chain; Experiment confirm; Eye-tracking; Level of difficulties; Administrative data processing",,,,,,,,,"Ottensooser, A., Fekete, A., Reijers, H.A., Mendling, J., Meicstas, C., Making sense of business process descriptions: An experimental comparison of graphical and textual notations (2012) J.

In order to maximize usability, process models must be intuitive and easily understandable. In other words, processing the information contained within the process models must enable a successful completion of the task for which the model is being used. Recently, research efforts into the effects of user characteristics on understandability have increased. However, current limitations create promising research possibilities, particularly with regard to the use of realistic process models and direct data collection techniques. This thesis will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by investigating domain knowledge as a fundamental user characteristic and utilizing eye-tracking as a direct data collection method while using realistic, complex process models. The end goal of this research is to propose an automatic process model tailoring technique, with the aim of enhancing a user’s understanding and thus their performance. As of now a pilot study has indicated the existence of distinct reading strategies, which establishes the viability of the proposed future work. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Business process modeling; Domain knowledge; Process model tailoring; Process model understandability; Process model visualization; Reading strategy","Application programs; Eye tracking; Systems engineering; Business process model; Domain knowledge; Process model understandability; Process Modeling; Reading strategies; Data acquisition",,,,,"Universiteit Gent","Acknowledgements.

Therefore, it is important that such models can be easily and properly understood. Previous research has mainly focused on two types of factors that are important in this context: (i) properties of the model itself, and (ii) properties of the model reader. The work in this paper aims at determining how the performance of subjects varies across different types of comprehension tasks, which is a new angle. To reason about the complexity of comprehension tasks we take a theoretical perspective that is grounded in visual cognition. We test our hypotheses using a free-simulation experiment that incorporates eye-tracking technology. We find that model-related and person-related factors are fully mediated by variables of visual cognition. Moreover, in comparison, visual cognition variables provide a significantly higher explanatory power for the duration and efficiency of comprehension tasks. These insights shed a new perspective on what influences sense-making of process models, shifting the attention from model and reader characteristics to the complexity of the problem-solving task at hand. Our work opens the way to investigate and develop effective strategies to support readers of process models, for example through the context-sensitive use of visual cues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business process model comprehension; Complexity of process model comprehension task; Eye-tracking experiment business process model; Theoretical perspective model comprehension; Visual cognition factors of model comprehension","Decision support systems; Information systems; Business process model; Comprehension tasks; Context sensitive; Explanatory power; Eye tracking technologies; nocv1; Perspective models; Process Modeling; Visual Cognition; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,"Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J., Reijers, H.A., Fundamentals of Business Process Management (2013), Springer; Reijers, H.A., Mendling, J., A study into the factors that influence the understandability of business process models (2011) Syst.

Besides process model creation, the reading and understanding of process models is of utmost importance. To better understand the latter, we have developed a conceptual framework focusing on the comprehension of business process models. By adopting concepts from cognitive neuroscience and psychology, the paper presents initial results from a series of eye tracking experiments on process model comprehension. The results indicate that experiences with process modeling have an influence on overall model comprehension. In turn, with increasing process model complexity, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling do not significantly differ with respect to process model comprehension. The results further indicate that both groups face similar challenges in reading and comprehending process models. The conceptual framework takes these results into account and provides the basis for the further experiments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Business process model comprehension; Cognition; Eye tracking","Information systems; Process engineering; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Business process model; Cognition; Cognitive neurosciences; Conceptual frameworks; Eye-tracking; Process model complexity; Process Modeling; Process-aware information systems; Management information systems",,,,,,,,,"Ottensooser, A., Fekete, A., Reijers, H.A., Mendling, J., Meicstas, C., Making sense of business process descriptions: An experimental comparison of graphical and textual notations (2012) J.

In this context, graphical process models are used to enhance the process comprehensibility of the stakeholders involved. The large number of available modeling languages, however, aggravates process model comprehension and increases the knowledge gap between domain and modeling experts. Upon this, one major challenge is to identify factors fostering the comprehension of process models. This paper discusses the experiences we gathered with the use of eye tracking in experiments on process model comprehension and the lessons learned in this context. The objective of the experiments was to study the comprehension of process models expressed in terms of four different modeling languages (i.e., BPMN, eGantt, EPC, and Petri Net). This paper further provides recommendations along nine identified categories that can foster related experiments on process model comprehension. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Experiment; Eye tracking; Process model comprehension","Experiments; Information systems; Management information systems; Petri nets; Process engineering; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Business Process; Eye-tracking; Graphical process models; Knowledge gaps; Process model; Process Modeling; Process modeling language; Modeling languages",,,,,,,,,"Petrusel, R., Mendling, J., Reijers, H.A., Task-specific visual cues for improving process model understanding (2016) Inf.

However, continuous measurement of CL in software design activities, for example, conceptual modeling, has received little attention. In this paper, we present the progress of our work intended to close this gap by continuously measuring cognitive load during design activities. This work aims at advancing our understanding of WHEN and WHY designers face challenges. For this, we attempt to explore and explain the occurrence of CL using fine-granular units of analysis (e.g., type of subtasks, evolution of design artifact’s quality, and manner of technology use). We expect implications for the future development of intelligent software systems, which are aware WHEN a particular designer experiences challenges, but also WHY challenges occur. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Business process management; Cognitive load; Eye tracking; Process model creation; Process modeling",,,,,,,,,,"Chen, F., Zhou, J., Wang, Y., Yu, K., Arshad, S.Z., Khawaji, A., Conway, D., (2016) Eye-Based Measures, pp. 75-85. , Springer International Publishing, Cham; Hungerford, B.C., Hevner, A.R., Collins, R.W., Reviewing software diagrams: A cognitive study (2004) IEEE Trans.

In order to make effective use of these models, they have to be readily understandable. Objective Prior research has emphasized the potential of visual cues to highlight relevant matters in models such that stakeholders can use them more efficiently. What prior research does not explain is in how far visual cues can be customized to specific understanding tasks and how this influences cognition. Method In this paper, we address these questions with an experimental research design, in which we use eye-tracking equipment to capture how process experts use models to answer comprehension questions. As a treatment, we designed two manipulations of the secondary notation, namely coloring and layout, to direct attention to the elements relevant for the specific tasks. Results Our results indicate that both manipulations improve both eye-tracking-based measures and performance measures such as duration and efficiency, with color having the stronger effect. Conclusions Our findings lay the foundation for novel features of process modeling tools that provide modifications of secondary notation in response to specific user queries. More generally, our research emphasizes the importance of the relevant region associated with a particular model understanding task. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Business process model understanding; Color process model elements; Process model relevant region; Scoping task specific model elements; Visual cues","Information systems; Business process model; Designing process; Experimental research; Model understanding; Performance measure; Process Modeling; Task-specific models; Visual cues; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,"Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J., Reijers, H.A., Fundamentals of Business Process Management (2013), Springer; (2011), Object Management Group.

However, these simulations fail to specify precisely what aspect(s) of lexical processing (e.g., orthographic processing) account for the concurrent changes in eye movements and reading skill. To examine this issue, the E-Z Reader model was first used to simulate the aggregate eye-movement data from 15 adults and 75 children to replicate the finding that gross differences in reading skill can be accounted for by differences in lexical processing proficiency. The model was then used to simulate the eye-movement data of individual children so that the best-fitting lexical processing parameters could be correlated to measures of orthographic knowledge, phonological processing skill, sentence comprehension, and general intelligence. These analyses suggest that orthographic knowledge accounts for variance in the eye-movement measures that is observed with between-individual differences in reading skill. The theoretical implications of this conclusion will be discussed in relation to computational models of reading and our understanding of reading skill development. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Development; E-Z Reader; Eye movements; Lexical processing; Reading; Skill","adolescent; adult; Article; child; cognitive development; comprehension; controlled study; e z reader model; eye movement control; eye tracking; female; human; human experiment; information processing; intelligence; knowledge; male; normal human; priority journal; process model; psychometry; reading; spelling; visual acuity; eye movement; major clinical study; mental development; processing; reading test; simulation",,,,,"University of Southampton

In this paper we propose to combine a continuous, psycho-physiological measurement of cognitive load with a detailed analysis of the modeler’s interactions of the modeling environment as well as eye movement analysis to obtain task-specific imposed cognitive load values. We present initial results in terms of a tool, lessons learnt from a pilot study and discuss upcoming challenges.

Purpose: This paper has sought to verify the effectiveness of the ATA process model through its application in a centre for technical aids in severe motor disability cases. Method: The ATA process was applied to a case study of a 6.5-year-old female child with cerebral palsy during a period of three years. The process consisted of three 12-monthcycles of AT assessment, matching, and assignment. The first cycle focused on the evaluation of the user's requests and the assistive solution assessments, while the last two cycles focused on the post-assignation follow-up, and re-evaluation of the previous solutions by fine-tuning AT assignations. Results: After several multidisciplinary team meetings and an environmental evaluation, the child was provided with an E-Tran, a scanning system utilizing Clicker software, a new postural system, and eye-tracking system solution. The ATA process model guided the centre's professionals and the user's milieu to better analysis and comprehension of the user's needs. The effectiveness of the ATA process was highlighted by the user's improvement in autonomy, social integration and communication, and in oculi-motor and postural control. Conclusions: This case study highlights how a multidisciplinary and user-focused assessment process is effective over time. The roles of the psycho-technologist and the psychologist throughout the phases of the ATA process emerged as fundamentally important to reach an effective outcome in an ATA process.","Assistive technology; Case study; ICF-CY; Matching person and technology; Psycho-technologist; Psychologist; Service delivery",,,,,,,,,,"(2003) AAATE position paper: A 2003 view on Technology and Disability, , http://www.aaate.net/, Retrieved Jun 30, 2014; Corradi, F., Scherer, M.J., Lo Presti, A., Measuring the Assistive Technology Match (2012) Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook, pp. 49-65. , S.

In an effort to investigate the underlying reasons, we conducted a usability study to investigate the affordances of software visualization techniques for the maintenance of complex software systems. Expert programmers were asked to carry out programming tasks with or without using a software visualization tool while their screens and eye gaze patterns were recorded. Statistical analysis of task performance data showed that participants who used the software visualization tool outperformed the control group in terms of task completion time and accuracy. However, quantitative analysis of performance measures did not reveal in what ways software visualizations contributed to this improvement. In an effort to identify the cognitive strategies that underlie this quantitative performance difference, process models grounded in qualitative analysis of eye-tracking data were constructed. The process models indicated that software visualizations guided the subjects in the experiment group toward following specific software comprehension strategies, which account for the difference observed in task performance data. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Complex software systems; Grounded theory approach; Performance measure; Qualitative analysis; Software comprehension; Software visualization; Software visualization tool; Task completion time; Computer aided software engineering; Visualization",,,,,,,,,"Asimakopoulos, S., Fildes, R., Dix, A., Forecasting software visualizations: an explorative study (2009) Paper presented at the the 23rd British HCI Group Annual Conference on People and Computers: Celebrating People and Technology, , October 21, October 21, Swinton, UK, Swinton, UK; Bednarik, R., Tukiainen, R., An eye-tracking methodology for characterizing program comprehension processes (2006) Paper presented at the Eye Tracking Research & Applications Symposium March 27-29, , San DiegoCA; Bessey, A., Block, K., Chelf, B., Chou, A., Fulton, B., Hallem, S., Engler, D., A few billion lines of code later: Using static analysis to find bugs in the real world (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53, pp. 66-75; Brooks, R.E., Towards a theory of the comprehension of computer programs (1983) International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 18, pp. 543-554; Coleman, G., O'Connor, R., Using grounded theory to understand software process improvement: A study of Irish software product companies (2007) Information and Software Technology, 49, pp. 654-667; Corritore, C.L., Wiedenbeck, S., What do novices learn during program comprehension?

Those factors were determined using statistical approaches either on model repositories or on experiments based on comprehension questions. We noticed that, when asking comprehension questions on a process model, usually the expert explores only a part of the entire model to provide the answer. This paper formalizes this observation under the notion of Relevant Region. We conduct an experiment using eye-tracking to prove that the Relevant Region is indeed correlated to the answer given to the comprehension question. We also give evidence that it is possible to predict whether the correct answer will be given to a comprehension question, knowing the number and the time spent fixating Relevant Region elements. This paper sets the foundations for future improvements on model comprehension research and practice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","process model comprehension factors; process model eye tracking experiment; process model relevant region","Business process model; Comprehension tasks; Eye-tracking; Future improvements; Model repositories; Process model; Statistical approach; Time spent; Information systems; Systems engineering; Experiments",,,,,,,,,"Recker, J., Rosemann, M., Green, P.F., Indulska, M., Do Ontological Deficiencies in Modeling Grammars Matter?

This article focuses on the interdisciplinary combination of three methods - iconology, a qualitative method of visual analysis targeted at the meanings of visuals and based in the humanities, and eye-tracking and psychophysiological reaction measurement, both based in experimental psychology. The authors propose a Visual Communication Process Model as an integrative means for connecting different facets of the communication processes involved in visual mass communication. The goal of this new model is to widen and sharpen the focus on explaining (a) meaning-attribution processes, (b) visual perception and attention processes, and (c) psychophysiological reactions to mass-mediated visuals, illustrated in this article with examples of press photography. © The Author(s), 2012.","eye-tracking; iconology; press photography; psychophysiology; visual methods",,,,,,,"The present special issue testifies to the rapid development that the inclusion of eye-tracking into the communication scientist’s tool box has triggered. Given the importance of visuals in all walks of life, visual communication is still marginalized in the study of communication. However, objective measures of visual attention do contribute to a better understanding of how humans interact with their world, including personal and mass-mediated images. This is important as textual communication has a sequential logic that is evident, easily produced and easily reproduced as intended. However, images are more complex and based on non-sequential association. Additionally, the exploration and interaction of the individual with an image is much more idiosyncratic. While visual perception involves a sequential process, the physical source material of an image consists of a large array of information that is being fed through a non-sequential funnel of visual attention. Every time we look at an image, there are likely to be differences in how we look at it, how we interact with it, how we use it to answer questions, or are challenged by what we see – the interaction of the mental and material images. It is here that a multidisciplinary research design opens windows on the comprehension of visual communication. However, neither eye-tracking, nor iconology or psychophysiology are mind reading methods. Even if they were, if we think of mind as the thoughts that the little voice in our head seems to provide, this is only the tip of the iceberg of how our brain – and with it our biological and socio-cultural history – deals with the interaction of the self and visual representations. Meaning is an utterly complicated construct that involves concepts that have been discussed in the humanities, social and behavioural sciences. These approaches hold controversial assumptions as to what exactly influences meaning-attribution, or by what specifically the meaning is ‘triggered’ – by the material image/artifact, or by the mind of the observer, or even by the mind of the producer. It is with this complexity in mind that we are proposing the VCPM. We see it as short-hand for the integration of theories and empirical evidence, generated in different disciplines. It is a roadmap for further research and interdisciplinary exchange. It requires multidisciplinary approaches and necessitates good will and tolerance from all disciplines involved when dealing with the complexity of the visual process and coping with the difficulties of bridging disciplinary gaps by creating interfaces and synapses that could improve our understanding of visuals that are increasingly omnipresent, yet more ominous than obvious. The authors would like to thank the reviewers of this paper for their constructive criticism which helped to improve the manuscript to a considerable degree. The two pilot studies were made possible thanks to start-up funding provided by the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Jacobs University Bremen. ‘Perceiving Press Photography’ is a transdisciplinary research project conducted in the context of, and with support from, the Research Center Visual Communication and Expertise (VisComX) at Jacobs University ( www.jacobs-university.de/viscomx ). 1. We conducted a third pilot study testing for psychophysiological reactions to the same visual stimuli.

In this article, we first review what is known about eye movements during reading. Then we provide an updated version of the model (E-Z Reader 7) and describe how it accounts for basic findings about eye movement control in reading. We then review several alternative models of eye movement control in reading, discussing both their core assumptions and their theoretical scope. On the basis of this discussion, we conclude that E-Z Reader provides the most comprehensive account of eye movement control during reading. Finally, we provide a brief overview of what is known about the neural systems that support the various components of reading, and suggest how the cognitive constructs of our model might map onto this neural architecture. © 2003 Cambridge University Press.","Attention; E-Z reader; Eye-movement control; Fixations; Lexical access; Models; Reading regressions; Saccades","computer simulation; eye fixation; eye movement control; eye tracking; intermethod comparison; latent period; linguistics; nerve cell network; oculomotor system; process control; process model; reading; review; saccadic eye movement; selective attention; task performance; theoretical study; visual acuity; visual information; visual stimulation; visuomotor coordination; word recognition; Eye Movements; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Models, Neurological; Models, Psychological; Oculomotor Muscles; Reading; Verbal Behavior; Vision, Binocular",,,,,,,,,,"Reichle, E.D.; Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: reichle@pitt.edu",,,,,,,,0140525X,,BBSCD,"15067951","English","Behav.
