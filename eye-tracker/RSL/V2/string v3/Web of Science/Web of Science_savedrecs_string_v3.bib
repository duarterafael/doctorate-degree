Abstract = {{Conceptual models are used to communicate information about a domain
   during the development of information systems. In two experimental
   studies using business process models, we demonstrate how eye tracking
   can contribute to understanding the cognitive processes by which readers
   use conceptual modeling scripts to perform problem solving tasks. In the
   first study, we compare scripts generated using two process modeling
   grammars and demonstrate how attention paid to specific parts of scripts
   generated using grammar variations, and differences in visual
   association between parts of a diagram, account for task performance. In
   the second study, we use a combination of eye tracking and verbal
   protocol analysis to examine how visual association between parts of
   conceptual modeling scripts can indicate cognitive integration while
   performing problem solving tasks. The studies show that task performance
   can be explained with different mental processes, reflected in specific
   eye tracking behavior, where scripts developed following different rules
   invoke different cognitive processes. We show that attention can be
   measured by eye tracking and can explain task performance. In addition,
   we show that visual association (which is observable) between parts of a
   modeling script involves cognitive integration (which is not
   observable). This finding can be used to improve conceptual modeling
   grammars in several ways, including understanding the effects of
   alternative visual arrangements of models on how effectively they
   communicate domain knowledge for particular tasks, and guiding the
   design of visual modeling notations.}},

Abstract = {{Process Models (PM) are visual documentations of the business processes
   within or across enterprises. Activities (tasks) are arranged together
   into a model (i.e., similar to flowcharts). This study aimed at
   understanding the underlying structure of PM comprehension. Though
   standards for describing PM have been defined, the cognitive work load
   they evoke, their structure, and the efficacy of information
   transmission are only partially understood. Two studies were conducted
   to better differentiate the concept of visual literacy (VL) and logical
   reasoning in interpreting PM.
   Study I: A total of 1047 students from 52 school classes were assessed.
   Three different process models of increasing complexity were presented
   on tablets. Additionally, written labels of the models' elements were
   randomly allocated to scholars in a 3-group between-subjects design.
   Comprehension of process models was assessed by a series of 3 x 4 (=12)
   dichotomous test items. Latent Class Analysis of solved items revealed 6
   qualitatively differing solution patterns, suggesting that a single test
   score is insufficient to reflect participants' performance.
   Study II: Overall, 21 experts and 15 novices with respect to visual
   literacy were presented the same set of PMs as in Study I, while wearing
   eye tracking glasses. The fixation duration on relevant parts of the PM
   and on questions were recorded, as well as the total time needed to
   solve all 12 test items. The number of gaze transitions between process
   model and comprehension questions was measured as well. Being an expert
   in visual literacy did not alter the capability of correctly
   understanding graphical logical PMs. Presenting PMs that are labelled by
   single letters had a significant influence on reducing the time spent on
   irrelevant model parts but did not affect the fixation duration on
   relevant areas of interest.
   Both samples' participants required longer response times with
   increasing model complexity. The number of toggles (i.e., gaze
   transitions between model and statement area of interest) was predictive
   for membership in one of the latent classes. Contrary to expectations,
   denoting the PM events and decisions not with real-world descriptions,
   but with single letters, led to lower cognitive workload in responding
   to comprehension questions and to better results. Visual Literacy
   experts could neither outperform novices nor high-school students in
   comprehending PM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of a process model is a process consisting of five distinct
   phases, i.e., problem understanding, method finding, modeling,
   reconciliation, and validation. To enable a fine-grained analysis of
   process model creation based on phases or the development of
   phase-specific modeling support, an automatic approach to detect phases
   is needed. While approaches exist to automatically detect modeling and
   reconciliation phases based on user interactions, the detection of
   phases without user interactions (i.e., problem understanding, method
   finding, and validation) is still a problem. Exploiting a combination of
   user interactions and eye tracking data, this paper presents a two-step
   approach that is able to automatically detect the sequence of phases a
   modeler is engaged in during model creation. The evaluation of our
   approach shows promising results both in terms of quality as well as
   computation time demonstrating its feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{Business process models constitute fundamental artifacts for enterprise
   architectures as well as for the engineering of processes and
   information systems. However, less experienced stakeholders (i.e.,
   novices) face a wide range of issues when trying to read and comprehend
   these models. In particular, process model comprehension not only
   requires knowledge on process modeling notations, but also skills to
   visually and correctly interpret the models. In this context, many
   unresolved issues concerning the factors hindering process model
   comprehension exist and, hence, the identification of these factors
   becomes crucial. Using eye-tracking as an instrument, this paper
   presents the results obtained of a study, in which we analyzed
   eye-movements of novices and experts, while comprehending process models
   expressed in terms of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
   2.0. Further, recorded eye-movements are visualized as scan paths to
   analyze the applied comprehension strategies. We learned that experts
   comprehend process models more effectively than novices. In addition, we
   observed particular patterns for eye-movements (e.g., back-and-forth
   saccade jumps) as well as different strategies of novices and experts in
   comprehending process models.}},

Abstract = {{Business process models have been adopted by enterprises for more than a
   decade. Especially for domain experts, the comprehension of process
   models constitutes a challenging task that needs to be mastered when
   creating or reading these models. This paper presents the results we
   obtained from an eye tracking experiment on process model comprehension.
   In detail, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process
   modeling were confronted with models expressed in terms of Event-driven
   Process Chains (EPCs), reflecting different levels of difficulty. The
   first results of this experiment confirm recent findings from one of our
   previous experiments on the reading and comprehension of process models.
   On one hand, independent from their level of expertise, all individuals
   face similar patterns, when being confronted with process models
   exceeding a certain level of difficulty. On the other, it appears that
   process models expressed in terms of EPCs are perceived differently
   compared to process models specified in the Business Process Model and
   Notation (BPMN). In the end, their generalization needs to be confirmed
   by additional empirical experiments. The presented experiment continues
   a series of experiments that aim to unravel the factors fostering the
   comprehension of business process models by using methods and theories
   stemming from the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Process analysts and other professionals extensively use process models
   to analyze business processes and identify performance improvement
   opportunities. Therefore, it is important that such models can be easily
   and properly understood. Previous research has mainly focused on two
   types of factors that are important in this context: (i) properties of
   the model itself, and (ii) properties of the model reader. The work in
   this paper aims at determining how the performance of subjects varies
   across different types of comprehension tasks, which is a new angle. To
   reason about the complexity of comprehension tasks we take a theoretical
   perspective that is grounded in visual cognition. We test our hypotheses
   using a free-simulation experiment that incorporates eye-tracking
   technology. We find that model-related and person-related factors are
   fully mediated by variables of visual cognition. More-over, in
   comparison, visual cognition variables provide a significantly higher
   explanatory power for the duration and efficiency of comprehension
   tasks. These insights shed a new perspective on what influences
   sense-making of process models, shifting the attention from model and
   reader characteristics to the complexity of the problem solving task at
   hand. Our work opens the way to investigate and develop effective
   strategies to support readers of process models, for example through the
   context-sensitive use of visual cues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{63-78}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context: Business process models support various stakeholders in
   managing business processes and designing process-aware information
   systems. In order to make effective use of these models, they have to be
   readily understandable.
   Objective: Prior research has emphasized the potential of visual cues to
   highlight relevant matters in models such that stakeholders can use them
   more efficiently. What prior research does not explain is in how far
   visual cues can be customized to specific understanding tasks and how
   this influences cognition.
   Method: In this paper, we address these questions with an experimental
   research design, in which we use eye-tracking equipment to capture how
   process experts use models to answer comprehension questions. As a
   treatment, we designed two manipulations of the secondary notation,
   namely coloring and layout, to direct attention to the elements relevant
   for the specific tasks.
   Results: Our results indicate that both manipulations improve both
   eye-tracking-based measures and performance measures such as duration
   and efficiency, with color having the stronger effect.
   Conclusions: Our findings lay the foundation for novel features of
   process modeling tools that provide modifications of secondary notation
   in response to specific user queries. More generally, our research
   emphasizes the importance of the relevant region associated with a
   particular model understanding task. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While factors impacting process model comprehension are relatively well
   understood by now, little is known about process model creation and
   factors impacting the quality of the resulting process model as well as
   the modeler's cognitive load. In this paper we propose to combine a
   continuous, psycho-physiological measurement of cognitive load with a
   detailed analysis of the modeler's interactions of the modeling
   environment as well as eye movement analysis to obtain task-specific
   imposed cognitive load values. We present initial results in terms of a
   tool, lessons learnt from a pilot study and discuss upcoming challenges.
   This work provides the basis for investigating task imposed cognitive
   load during process model creation by enabling a dynamic, semi-automatic
   analysis of cognitive load.}},

Abstract = {{The research introduced in the paper is placed in the area of Business
   Process Management (BPM). It is a major concern for industry and
   research, having process models are at its core. The paper approaches
   controlled experiments that employ eye-tracking as the observation
   method, for researching process model understanding. Previous research
   in the field, was conducted using only indirect observation methods.
   Eye-tracking was employed in several related fields, from which we
   distill the major points of interest related to experimental design
   (e.g. metrics, tasks, participant selection, etc.). The main
   contribution of the paper is a set of guidelines based on the
   state-of-the-art review, and our own experience with eye-tracking based
   controlled experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The assistive technology assessment (ATA) process developed
   by Federici and Scherer in 2012 provides professionals with guidelines
   for effective outcomes in assistive technology (AT) selection and
   assignment process with the aim to match a person with AT. Purpose. This
   paper has sought to verify the effectiveness of the ATA process model
   through its application in a centre for technical aids in severe motor
   disability cases. Method. The ATA process was applied to a case study of
   a 6.5-year-old female child with cerebral palsy during a period of three
   years. The process consisted of three 12-monthcycles of AT assessment,
   matching, and assignment. The first cycle focused on the evaluation of
   the user's requests and the assistive solution assessments, while the
   last two cycles focused on the post-assignation follow-up, and
   re-evaluation of the previous solutions by fine-tuning AT assignations.
   Results: After several multidisciplinary team meetings and an
   environmental evaluation, the child was provided with an E-Tran, a
   scanning system utilizing Clicker software, a new postural system, and
   eye-tracking system solution. The ATA process model guided the centre's
   professionals and the user's milieu to better analysis and comprehension
   of the user's needs. The effectiveness of the ATA process was
   highlighted by the user's improvement in autonomy, social integration
   and communication, and in oculi-motor and postural control. Conclusions:
   This case study highlights how a multidisciplinary and user-focused
   assessment process is effective over time. The roles of the
   psycho-technologist and the psychologist throughout the phases of the
   ATA process emerged as fundamentally important to reach an effective
   outcome in an ATA process.}},

Abstract = {{Any analysis of how mass-mediated visuals are perceived and interpreted
   in multimodal contexts should be informed by a scientific understanding
   of the biological constraints on visual processing, as well as a solid
   culturally aware visual communication approach. This article focuses on
   the interdisciplinary combination of three methods - iconology, a
   qualitative method of visual analysis targeted at the meanings of
   visuals and based in the humanities, and eye-tracking and
   psychophysiological reaction measurement, both based in experimental
   psychology. The authors propose a Visual Communication Process Model as
   an integrative means for connecting different facets of the
   communication processes involved in visual mass communication. The goal
   of this new model is to widen and sharpen the focus on explaining (a)
   meaning-attribution processes, (b) visual perception and attention
   processes, and (c) psychophysiological reactions to mass-mediated
   visuals, illustrated in this article with examples of press photography.}},
