abstract = "This article presents cognitive models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a critical review of the empiric literature in which GAD has been associated with affect-related information-processing biases, particularly in the domains of attention, memory, and problem solving. Not included in this article are studies of cognitive features of nonclinical anxiety and worry, although this body of research may be relevant to GAD. The core feature of GAD, worry, is regarded as maladaptive information processing, biased in the direction of threat. The centrality of “threat” to everyday events and possibilities clearly is mirrored in the concerns commonly expressed by individuals with GAD—judging another's look of disapproval as a sign of personal social failure or judging lateness as a sign of personal incompetence, but despite the flood of research in this area and the robust evidence for certain types of cognitive biases in GAD, the empiric investigation of threat-related information processing is in its infancy. Most paradigms used to date fail to test key assumptions of the cognitive models of GAD. Also, testing of the extent to which affect-related information-processing biases are unique to GAD or are common to all of the anxiety disorders generally is absent. After reviewing the extant literature, the authors suggest several novel tests of affective information processing and highlight the benefits of using multiple comparison groups and prospective studies to fully test the hypothesis that cognitive biases contribute to the development and maintenance of GAD."

This article exposes a brief history of information search models, from general and behavioural models to cognitive ones and presents recent theoretical advances in this research field.
Literature findings
Since the beginning of 1990s, many theoretical models have tried to describe and predict the human behaviours involved in the information search tasks, and specifically when this activity is performed in computer systems. Some of these models elaborated by psychologists have attempted to infer the cognitive processes involved.
Discussion
Information search can be considered as a complex cognitive activity that involves various individual (cognitive, affective), contextual and social factors.
Conclusion
We also suggest research issues to be developed in order to increase our knowledge in this area and we plead for further research on specific concepts depending on future and/or recent areas of interest.
Résumé
Cet article présente un bref historique des modèles de la recherche d’information ainsi que les avancées récentes dans ce domaine de recherche. Depuis le début des années 1990, de nombreux modèles théoriques ont cherché à décrire et prédire les comportements humains impliqués lors de recherche d’information, spécialement lorsque cette activité est réalisée dans des environnements numériques. Et certains de ces modèles élaborés par des psychologues s’attachent à décrire les processus cognitifs sous-jacents. Dans un premier temps, les modèles généraux sont présentés pour parvenir aux modèles cognitifs de cette activité complexe qu’est la recherche d’information. Différents facteurs individuels (cognitifs, émotionnels), contextuels et sociaux influencent l’activité de recherché d’information et doivent être considérés par les recherches à venir. Des pistes pour les recherches à venir sont présentées en insistant particulièrement sur certains concepts qu’il convient d’approfondir par de nouvelles études."

Given that human error plays such a central role in aviation accidents, it is crucial to understand the causes of error and the ways errors contribute to accidents. Furthering this understanding should be the foundation of any safety research program, and any operational safety program should be built on this foundation. Finding ways to improve safety and efficiency and to reduce costs are central aspects of the work of human factors experts, thus these experts require a deep and veridical understanding of the nature and context of human error. This chapter attempts to provide a foundation for that understanding and a framework for practical application. The way in which errors are analyzed and interpreted hinges on one's perspective on what causes error. The chapter presents a perspective on the nature of errors made by skilled professionals such as pilots and the roles those errors play in accidents. It discusses the types of information we need in order to understand why error-related accidents occur, examines sources of this information, and describes diverse approaches to analyzing errors and accidents. It illustrates some analytical approaches and concludes by examining the implications of these studies for developing countermeasures for reducing vulnerability to error."

Motivated by this gap, we conducted a qualitative study of professionals with unit testing experience. The goal was to understand how to improve the cognitive support provided by the testing tools, by considering the practitioners’ perspective on their unit testing review practices. We obtained the responses from our volunteers through a questionnaire composed both of open-ended and closed questions. Our results revealed some primary tasks which require cognitive support, including monitoring of pending and executed unit testing tasks, and navigating across unit testing related artifacts. We summarize our results in a framework, and based on it, we develop a research agenda as an actionable instrument to the community. Our study’s contributions comprise practical improvement suggestions for the current tools and describe further opportunities for research in software testing.

We then outline the brain regions involved in both triggering and modulating affect, and how they may change throughout development and into old age.

Importantly, participants were instructed to focus on the nonword-likeness of presented items, not their word-likeness. We obtained no old/new effects. In Experiment 2, participants discriminated old from new words and old from new pseudowords during recognition, and they did so as quickly as possible. We found old/new effects for both words and pseudowords. In Experiment 3, we used materials and an old/new design known to elicit a large number of incorrect responses. For false alarms (“old” response for new word), we found larger pupils than for correctly classified new items, starting at the point at which response execution was allowed (2750ms post stimulus onset). In contrast, pupil size for misses (“new” response for old word) was statistically indistinguishable from pupil size in correct rejections. Taken together, our data suggest that pupil old/new effects result more from the intentional use of memory than from its automatic use."

Twenty-one schizophrenic, 8 affective, and 16 normal controls were studied. The results were consistent with the hypotheses; schizophrenic subjects had distinctive performance patterns, especially at 40 bpm, which was associated with both motor and thinking disturbance. The authors discuss additional analyses that suggest that deficient motor synchrony is associated with negative symptoms, certain ward behaviors, and not with demographic variables, and that among umedicated schizophrenic subjects, the performance patterns are worse."

Theoretical frameworks emphasise associations between interpretations and responses to affect and bipolar disorder (BD). This review (PROSPERO CRD42016043801) investigated which emotion regulation (ER) strategies have been applied to BD, are elevated in BD compared to clinical and non-clinical controls, and are associated with clinical and functional outcomes in BD
Methods
Search terms relating to emotion regulation, coping and bipolar disorder were entered into Embase, MedLine and PsycInfo. Quantitative studies investigating relationships between ER strategies and BD were eligible for this narrative synthesis
Results
A large volume of research (n = 47) investigated specific ER strategies in BD. Maladaptive strategies such as rumination and dampening were elevated in BD compared to controls and these particular strategies had a detrimental impact on outcomes such as mood symptoms. BD had a similar profile of ER strategies to unipolar depression, but there was limited comparison to other clinical groups. People with BD did not generally have deficits in using adaptive strategies, as evidenced by comparisons with controls and experimental studies
Limitations
Methodological heterogeneity and a lack of ecologically valid ER assessments
Conclusions
Empirical literature is critiqued in line with contemporary theories of BD and of emotion regulation more generally, in order to inform future research recommendations. This includes investigation of the importance of context in the impact of ER strategies, and discrepancies between trait and state use of ER strategies, particularly through experience sampling."

Instead, most sensors in cyber space were developed for operational uses, and thus are designed for usability, efficiency, and cost rather than scientific coverage and fidelity. This chapter will discuss what constitutes scientific instrumentation and includes a discussion and comparison to operational instrumentation. Topics discussed are: data sampling, instrumentation coverage, and axes of data fidelity. In addition, overviews of common sensors will be provided with use cases provided. Finally, a discussion of testbed environment attributes with existing example capabilities will be provided."

However, social psychology and behavioural research suggest that there is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use to make such choices. We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called ‘dual process models’, analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic–analytical and the heuristic–holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research."

Interviews with 19 product development practitioners were conducted, focussing on three topics: 1) the product development process and the integration of user involvement, 2) multidisciplinary teamwork, and 3) organizational attitude towards usability. Based on the interviews, context descriptions of the companies were created and barriers and enablers for usability were identified. To verify the findings and to discuss remaining issues a feedback workshop was held in which the primary contact from each company participated. The results indicate that differences in product–market combination lead to differences in organizational attitude towards usability. The prioritization of usability in an organization seems to be influenced by the degree of product complexity (complex products are more prone to suffer from usability issues) and whether developers think that usability is a purchase consideration for their clients. The product–market combination a company targets also affects the methods for user-centred design that a company can apply and that are relevant. What methods for user-centred design are used also seems to be influenced by the attitude towards usability: if usability is considered more important, methods that require more resources can be applied."

This approach includes punishment-based conflict, exploratory, and social interaction tasks. There has been a recent surge of interest in the translation of paradigms from animal to human, in efforts to increase generalization of findings and support the development of more effective mental health treatments. This article briefly reviews animal tests related to approach-avoidance conflict and results from lesion and pharmacologic studies utilizing these tests.

There is some preliminary evidence that nicotine may alter pre-attentive auditory change detection, as indexed by the EEG-derived mismatch negativity (MMN), but no previous study has examined what role auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) may have on these effects. The objective of this study was to examine MMN-indexed acoustic change detection in schizophrenia (SZ) following nicotine administration and elucidate its association with AVH. Using a modified multi-feature paradigm, MMNs to duration, frequency and intensity deviants were recorded in 12 schizophrenia outpatients (SZ) with persistent AVHs following nicotine (6mg) and placebo administration. Electrical activity was recorded from 32 scalp electrodes; MMN amplitudes and latencies for each deviant were compared between treatments and were correlated with trait (PSYRATS) and state measures of AVH severity and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ratings. Nicotine administration resulted in a shortened latency for intensity MMN. Additionally, nicotine-related change in MMN amplitude was correlated with nicotine-related change in subjective measures of hallucinatory state. In summary, nicotine did not affect MMN amplitudes in schizophrenia patients with persistent AVHs, however this study reports accelerated auditory change detection to intensity deviants with nicotine in this group. Additionally, nicotine appeared to induce a generalized activation of the auditory cortex in schizophrenia, resulting in a concurrent increase in intensity MMN amplitude and subjective clarity of AVHs."

Some argue that the two approaches should be kept separate because they have different underlying assumptions. Others disagree. Through problematization, we review the distinctions between process and variance approaches and examine such distinctions to show that these approaches sometimes overlap and can be combined. We then present a new set of assumptions for hybrid approaches and specifically distinguish between three types of combinations or hybrids, parallel, weakly blended, and strongly blended. We then introduce a toolbox for modeling hybrid approaches in a coherent way followed by an example on how to use the toolbox. We end the article by providing reasons for considering hybrid approaches, possible areas of research, and a set of guidelines for authors and review teams."

In applying these perspectives to the adult lifespan, we draw from lifespan theories of motivation. Given age-related declines in deliberative cognitive processes but enhancement in emotional processes, understanding the role of emotion in decision making in later life is paramount. In addition, findings are converging on a pattern in which an information-processing preference for negative information in youth shifts toward the positive in later life. This positivity effect plays an important role in decision making. Lastly, we consider how these findings apply to financial and health domains across the adult life span."

This paper highlights the influential role of design complexity for users’ first impressions of health websites.
Method
An experimental design was utilized to investigate whether a website's level of design complexity impacts user evaluations. An online questionnaire measured the hypothesized impact of design complexity on predictors of message effectiveness.
Results
Findings reveal that increased design complexity was positively associated with higher levels of perceived design esthetics, attitude toward the website, perceived message comprehensibility, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived message quality, perceived informativeness, and perceived visual informativeness.
Conclusion
This research gives further evidence that design complexity should be considered an influential variable for health communicators to effectively reach their audiences, as it embodies the critical first step for message evaluation via electronic platforms."

The “good & bad” problem refers to the categorization of regulatory strategies as being either adaptive or maladaptive. The “here & now” problem refers to concentration on a single regulatory stage that involves the actual execution or implementation of regulatory strategies. To transcend the “good & bad” problem, I provide a conceptual account, highlighting the underlying mechanisms of implemented regulatory options that yield a clear differential cost-benefit strategy profile. To transcend the “here & now” problem, I present a broad conceptual framework that views emotion regulation as a multistage phenomenon that includes important stages that precede and follow regulatory implementation. A central focus is given to a preimplementation regulatory selection stage, which involves choosing between available regulatory options in a manner that is sensitive to differing situational demands. Specifically, I review affective-cognitive-motivational determinants, underlying mechanisms, neural correlates, individual-social-cultural moderators, and developmental and clinical implications, of regulatory selection. I end by highlighting the importance of transcending the regulatory selection stage, by describing a postimplementation regulatory monitoring stage that involves deciding if and how to adapt actively implemented regulatory strategies, by describing a preimplementation regulatory identification stage that involves deciding whether to regulate one's emotions in the first place, and by linking regulatory stages together."

Almost 100 years earlier, Wernicke (1874) had made exactly the same theoretical move about single word comprehension. Confronted with a patient who made phonemic errors in speech and did not understand spoken language, he argued that the two performances arose because of a single impairment—a loss of the long-term store of the sounds of words, which he argued would produce exactly these two deficits. An analysis of two abnormal performances being because of a deficit in a single underlying function has trouble withstanding the observation that each of the abnormal performances occurs in isolation. Unfortunately for both Wernicke's theory and the theory that agrammatic speech and asyntactic comprehension have their origins in a single deficit of syntactic processing, disturbances of each function have been observed in isolation. Some agrammatic patients have normal comprehension, some patients without Broca's aphasia or agrammatism have disorders of comprehension that are indistinguishable from those seen in these syndromes. As far as is known, the same or at least similar disorders of comprehension occur in all aphasic syndromes."

In two studies, we test whether this effect generalizes to second order public goods in the form of punishment behavior in one-shot and iterated public good games and investigate the underlying motivations. In line with spontaneous cooperation, punishment decreases with increasing decision time. Negative affect moderates this spontaneous punishment effect in one-shot public good games, in that punishment decisions are made more quickly by persons who are more upset about the contribution behavior of their group members. Unlike spontaneous cooperation, spontaneous punishment is not directly influenced by dispositional pro-sociality but by situationally above-average contributions. An overall analysis indicates a three-way interaction in that the spontaneous punishment effect is mainly valid for above-average, highly upset contributors. Hence, our results highlight the uniqueness of spontaneous punishment as being, in contrast to spontaneous cooperation, an affect-driven phenomenon of above-average contributors."

Their susceptibility might arise from a variety of factors, including their genetic make-up, brain chemistry, family background, personality and other psychological variables, and environmental and sociocultural variables. Moreover, after substance use has become established, there are additional cognitive-motivational variables (e.g., substance-related attentional bias) that contribute to enacting behaviors consistent with the person's motivation to acquire and use the substance. People who are at such risk are likely to choose to use addictive substances even though doing so entails negative consequences. In the sense of complete freedom from being determined by causal factors, we believe that there is no such thing as free will, but defined as ability to make choices from among multiple options, even though the choices are ultimately governed by natural processes, addicted individuals are free to choose. Although they might appear unable to exercise this kind of free will in decisions about their substance use, addictive behaviors are ultimately always goal-directed and voluntary. Such goal pursuits manifest considerable flexibility. Even some severely addicted individuals can cease their use when the value of continuing the use abruptly declines or when the subjective cost of continuing the use is too great with respect to the incentives in other areas of their lives. Formal treatment strategies (e.g., contingency management, Systematic Motivational Counseling, cognitive training) can also be used to facilitate this reversal."

This chapter presents a discussion on syntactic parsing. Majority of sentence processing research has continued to address relatively traditional topics such as the initial factors affecting processing, reanalysis, and structural complexity. It now seems reasonable to conclude that completely modular accounts of initial processing such as traditional Garden-Path theory are not correct and that the processor draws on a range of sources of information during initial processing. However, there are good reasons to believe that structural information does play a role during sentence processing and cannot be reduced to a set of weakly interacting constraints. Whereas research has shown that discourse context, plausibility, and frequency play important roles during sentence processing, they often do not entirely override basic preferences for particular types of structure. Sentence is judged grammatically more often than a comparable sentence in which the reparandum is ambiguous (picked). This interpretation would suggest that a reparandum behaves similarly as a subliminal fast prime. These examples suggest that parsing research may begin to focus more on naturalistic language, dialog, and the integration with complex nonlinguistic contexts. One effect of these trends is that there may be a closer link between comprehension and production—in particular, between parsing and syntactic encoding during production."

Once hallmark of this period is progressive improvements (relative to children) in cognitive control, core mental abilities enabling the ‘top-down’, endogenous control over behavior. However, as adolescents transition to more mature (adult) levels of functioning, limitations still exist in the ability to consistently and flexibly exert cognitive control across various contexts into the early twenties. Adolescence is also marked by peaks in sensation, novelty, and reward seeking behaviors thought to stem from normative increases in responsiveness in limbic and paralimbic brain structures, beginning around the onset of puberty. Asynchronous maturation in these systems during the adolescent period likely contributes to immature decision-making, strongly influenced by ‘bottom-up’ reward processes, and may help explain noted increases in risk taking behavior during adolescence. In this paper, structural and functional maturation in brain systems supporting reward and cognitive control processing are reviewed as a means to better understand risk taking. Particular emphasis is placed on adolescents' experimentation with drugs as a specific example of a risky behavior."

Research on the neural substrates of adolescent affective behavior is beginning to paint a more nuanced picture of how neurodevelopmental changes in brain function influence affective behavior, and how these influences are modulated by external factors in the environment. Recent neurodevelopmental models suggest that the brain is designed to promote emotion regulation, learning, and affiliation across development, and that affective behavior reciprocally interacts with age-specific social demands and different social contexts. In this review, we discuss current findings on neurobiological mechanisms of adolescents’ affective behavior and highlight individual differences in and social-contextual influences on adolescents’ emotionality. Neurobiological mechanisms of affective processes related to anxiety and depression are also discussed as examples. As the field progresses, it will be critical to test new hypotheses generated from the foundational empirical and conceptual work and to focus on identifying more precisely how and when neural networks change in ways that promote or thwart adaptive affective behavior during adolescence."

To examine the effect of patient narratives that discuss decision processes versus patient experiences on decisions about treatments for early stage breast cancer.
Methods
We recruited 300 women with no previous history of breast cancer to imagine that they had been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and to choose between mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation. Before learning about their treatment options, participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions with videotaped stories from fictitious cancer survivors, using a 2 (content: experience versus process)×2 (emotional valence: positive only vs. positive and negative) factorial design, or a control condition with no stories. We measured information search, treatment intentions, and decision satisfaction.
Results
Participants viewing process narratives spent more time searching for information. Participants viewing experience narratives reported a greater ability to imagine what it was like to experience the treatments; they also evaluated their decision more positively on several dimensions.
Conclusions
Process narratives appeared to guide information search, and experience narratives improved evaluations of the decision process.
Practice implications
There is no evidence that process and experience narratives ‘bias’ decisions in the same manner as outcome narratives. Further, their potential to focus patient attention on key information and increase patient confidence in decision making appears significant."

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework, the priority state space (PSS) framework, integrating sources of salience that guide visual attention according to a nested hierarchy of goals. Using the PSS framework as a scaffold, we review evidence of selected sources of implicit attentional guidance, including recent research on statistical learning, semantic associations, and motivational and affective salience. We next summarize current understanding of the underlying neural circuitry facilitating guidance of attention by specific sources of salience, including key neuromodulator systems, with an emphasis on affective salience and the noradrenergic system. Finally, we discuss evidence for common mechanisms of prioritization, including integration of sources of salience via priority maps, and introduce the concept of the PSS as a model for mapping a complex dynamic attentional landscape."

Three priming experiments were conducted using an auditory lexical decision task in which subjects made a lexical decision on a ‘target’ (the last word of each sentence) preceded by a ‘prime’ (a subject noun phrase and verb). The presence and magnitude of priming was compared to a baseline condition in which non-words systematically replaced real word primes. Normal subjects showed evidence for combinatorial thematics by exhibiting significant and larger amounts of thematic priming in the condition where two real words were present in the prime than in the conditions in which only one real word was present in the prime. Additionally, normal subjects showed sensitivity to both syntactic structures and pragmatics. In contrast, Broca’s patients did not show significant priming for any condition nor did they show a difference in the magnitude of priming among the conditions. Nonetheless, they showed sensitivity to pragmatics. Wernicke’s patients showed significant priming for all conditions, but did not show differences in the magnitude of priming among the conditions. However, they showed sensitivity to sentence grammaticality and pragmatics. The distinct patterns of performance of Broca’s and Wernicke’s aphasics are discussed in terms of the nature of their impairments in the processes of combinatorial thematics."

The best-fitting distribution of fixation durations with a relatively simple theoretical justification consists of a mixture of an exponential distribution and the convolution of two exponential distributions. The eye movements themselves were found to approximate a random walk that fits rather closely in both adult and juvenile subjects the motion postulated by the normative algorithm ordinarily taught in schools. Certain structural features of addition and subtraction exercises, such as the number of columns, the presence or absence of a carry or a borrow, are well known to affect their difficulty. In this study, regressions on such structural variables were found to account for only a relatively small part of the variation in eye-fixation durations."

The eye movements of readers are affected by both the meaning dominance of an ambiguous word and whether prior sentence context disambiguates the meaning. These findings have been used to support claims about the role of linguistic constraints on word identification. The adequacy of these claims has not been evaluated, that is, it is not known if the assumptions that have been made to account for the effects of lexical ambiguity resolution on eye movements are sufficient to explain these effects. This chapter discusses the E-Z Reader model of eye-movement control during reading that is used as a framework to evaluate the theoretical assumptions that have been developed to explain lexical ambiguity resolution. This modeling exercise is informative because it demonstrates that not all accounts of lexical ambiguity are equally viable, and because it suggests further constraints on the types of cognitive processes that drive eye movements during reading."

This chapter discusses the importance of prosody in language processing. The importance of prosody for understanding the language comprehension system stems from the primacy of spoken language. Infants acquire language from input that is almost entirely auditory and indeed show a preference for the prosody of their native language as early as 3 days of age suggesting prenatal sensitivity. The majority of adult language input is also spoken and in fact many languages of the world and dialects have no written form. Thus, spoken language, structured by prosodic form, is the “base” on which the mental representations and processes that compose linguistic processing are built. Current work on prosody and language processing shows a consistent, early influence of a prosodic representation on the production and comprehension of syntactic meaning in sentences and discourse. Prosody has an immediate rather than delayed effect on a range of syntactic parsing decisions, suggesting that prosody can determine the incremental construction of a syntactic representation on the fly during sentence comprehension. These effects have implications for the architecture of the language processing mechanism, suggesting that prosodic structure is primary to the process of recovering sentence structure."

To fill this gap, the current study tested two ethnicities of 3-year-old children using a combined cross-race/cross-age design. Caucasian children with and without older siblings and Mainland Chinese children without older siblings were tested for their ability to discriminate adult and child Caucasian faces as well as adult and child Asian faces in both upright and inverted orientations. Children of both ethnicities manifested an own-race bias, which was confined to adult faces, and an adult face bias, which was confined to own-race faces. Likewise, sibling experience affected Caucasian children’s processing of own-race child faces, but this effect did not generalize to other-race faces. Results suggest that race and age information are represented at the same hierarchical level in young children’s memory."

Although RDoC is often presented as paradigmatically revolutionary, a review of the history of psychophysiology suggests that roots of RDoC thinking extend at least as far back as the mid-20th Century. In this paper, we briefly and selectively review the historical emergence of neurobiologically-informed dimensional trait models of psychopathology, and we summarize our thinking regarding high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) as a transdiagnostic biomarker of self-regulation and cognitive control. When functional interactions between HF-HRV and systems of behavioral approach and avoidance are considered, diverse patterns of behavioral maladjustment can be subsumed into a single model. This model accommodates the general bifactor structure of psychopathology, and suggests that HF-HRV can be viewed as an autonomic, transdiagnostic biomarker of mental illness."

The pace in which technology changes and complexity increases requires increased efficiency in learning and understanding. This requires the engineers of tomorrow to quickly gain knowledge and insight outside their prime area of expertise. To transfer practical, how-to knowledge, to re-use design solutions and to teach students design solutions in the context of a specific domain, design patterns can be used. Design patterns offer a way to transfer knowledge that is more practical and ‘ready for use’ than a generic theory-based transfer of knowledge. However, the advantage of design patterns might go beyond re-use, design efficiency and flexibility. This paper argues that in addition to the benefits described above, there is a specific added value for the use of design patterns by students to acquire design skills and domain knowledge. To analyze this proposition we will analyze the literature on cognitive load and cognitive learning processes, and relate this to experiences from three case studies in which novices and experts were offered design patterns to develop and implement systems and processes. We will reflect on implications of the use of design patterns in computer-based teaching as well as on a potential support tool to improve the accessibility of pattern languages."

Although the discrimination performance of at-risk subjects equaled that of controls (n = 16), significant group differences occurred in event-related brain potential and heart rate responses.

We designed and executed a two-phase method to test the respiratory diseases module of the symptom checker Erdusyk. Phase I consisted of an online test with a large sample of users (n=53). In Phase I, users evaluated the system remotely and completed a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal Component Analysis was used to correlate each section of the interface with the questionnaire responses, thus identifying which areas of the user interface presented significant contributions to the technology acceptance. In the second phase, the think-aloud procedure was executed with a small number of samples (n=15), focusing on the areas with significant contributions to analyze the reasons for such contributions. Our method was used effectively to optimize the testing of symptom checker user interfaces. The method allowed kept the cost of testing at reasonable levels by restricting the use of the think-aloud procedure while still assuring a high amount of coverage. The main barriers detected in Erdusyk were related to problems understanding time repetition patterns, the selection of levels in scales to record intensities, navigation, the quantification of some symptom attributes, and the characteristics of the symptoms."

Qualitatively, the Glenmore model can account within one mechanism for preview and spillover effects, regressions, progressions, and refixations. It decouples the decision about when to move the eyes from the word recognition process. The time course of activity in a fixate centre (FC) determines the triggering of a saccade. The other main feature of the model is the use of a saliency map that acts as an arena for the interplay of bottom-up visual features of the text, and top-down lexical features. These factors combine to create a pattern of activation that selects one word as the saccade target. Even within the relatively simple framework proposed here, a coherent account can be provided for a range of eye movement control phenomena that have hitherto proved problematic to reconcile. The paper examines the performance of the model compared to data gathered in an empirical study of subjects reading a German text. The quantitative fit of the model, while reasonable, highlighted some limitations in the model that will need to be addressed in future versions."

Having as a motive the introduction of better tools for designing and developing systems that are self-aware of their vulnerabilities and react to prevent accidents and losses, this paper introduces the Risk Situation Awareness Provision (RiskSOAP) methodology to the field of road tunnel safety, as a means to measure this capability in this kind of systems. The main objective is to test the soundness and the applicability of RiskSOAP to infrastructure, which is advanced in terms of technology, human integration, and minimum number of safety requirements imposed by international bodies. RiskSOAP is applied to a specific road tunnel in Greece and the accompanying indicator is calculated twice, once for the tunnel design as defined by updated European safety standards and once for the ‘as-is’ tunnel composition, which complies with the necessary safety requirements, but calls for enhancing safety according to what EU and PIARC further suggest. The derived values indicate the extent to which each tunnel version is capable of comprehending its threats and vulnerabilities based on its elements. The former tunnel version seems to be more enhanced both in terms of it risk awareness capability and safety as well. Another interesting finding is that despite the advanced tunnel safety specifications, there is still room for enriching the safe design and maintenance of the road tunnel."

In smooth pursuit, this predictive processing is required to decrease tracking errors between the eye and the stimulus. Current models for motor sequence learning suggest parallel mechanisms in the brain for acquiring sequences of differing complexity. We examined this model by comparing shorter versus longer sequences of pursuit eye movements during fMRI. In this way we were able to identify overlapping and distinct brain areas involved in simple versus more complex oculomotor learning. Participants revealed predictive pursuit eye movements from the second presentation of the stimulus in both short and long sequences. Brain imaging results indicated activation of parallel brain areas for the different sequence lengths that consisted of the Inferior Occipital Gyrus and the Cingulate as areas in common. In addition, distinct activation was found in more working memory related brain regions for the shorter sequences (e.g. the middle frontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and higher activation in the frontal eye fields, supplementary motor cortex and motor cortex for the longer sequences, independent on the number of repetitions. These findings provide new evidence that there are parallel brain areas that involve working memory circuitry for short sequences, and more motoric areas when the sequence is longer and more cognitively demanding. Additionally, our findings are the first to show that the parallel brain regions involved in sequence learning in pursuit are independent of the number of repetitions, but contingent on sequence complexity."

The current study attempts to address these questions by focusing on the role of attention in the development of categorization. In Experiment 1, participants (adults, 7-year-olds, and 4-year-olds) were trained with novel categories consisting of deterministic and probabilistic features, and their categorization and memory for features were tested. In Experiment 2, participants’ attention was directed to the deterministic feature, and in Experiment 3 it was directed to the probabilistic features. Attentional cueing affected categorization and memory in adults and 7-year-olds: these participants relied on the cued features in their categorization and exhibited better memory of cued than of non-cued features. In contrast, in 4-year-olds attentional cueing affected only categorization, but not memory: these participants exhibited equally good memory for both cued and non-cued features. Furthermore, across the experiments, 4-year-olds remembered non-cued features better than adults. These results coupled with computational simulations provide novel evidence (1) pointing to differences in category representation and mechanisms of categorization across development, (2) elucidating the role of attention in the development of categorization, and (3) suggesting an important distinction between representation and decision factors in categorization early in development. These issues are discussed with respect to theories of categorization and its development."

Little research has attempted to find the underlying causes of the cognitive challenges or errors made during this stage. This paper describes a Modeling Expertise Framework (MEF) that uses modeler expertise to predict errors based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy (RBT). The utility of RBT is in providing a classification of cognitive processes that can be applied to knowledge activities such as conceptual modeling. We employ the MEF to map conceptual modeling tasks to different levels of cognitive complexity and classify current modeler expertise levels. An experimental exercise confirms our predictions of errors. Our work provides an understanding into why novices can handle entity classes and identifying binary relationships with some ease, but find other components like ternary relationships difficult. We discuss implications for data modeling training at a novice and intermediate level, which can be extended to other areas of Information Systems education and training."

A pre-test post-test design was used in which 768 Internet users filled out an online questionnaire. Participants were grouped in one of three fear appeal conditions: strong-fear appeal, weak-fear appeal and control condition. Claims regarding vulnerability of phishing attacks and claims concerning response efficacy of protective online information-sharing behaviour were manipulated in the fear appeal messages. The study demonstrates positive effects of fear appeals on heightening end-users’ cognitions, attitudes and behavioural intentions. However, future studies are needed to determine how subsequent security behaviour can be promoted, as the effects on this crucial aspect were not directly observed. Nonetheless, we conclude that fear appeals have great potential to promote security behaviour by making end users aware of threats and simultaneously providing behavioural advice on how to mitigate these threats."

However, claims about the efficacy of using affective EAs in DGBL have scarcely been subjected to empirical analysis. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of affective EAs on students' learning outcome, motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention in an information literacy (IL) game. In total, 159 tertiary students were recruited and randomly assigned in a pre-test post-test between-subjects experiment with three conditions: affective-EA, neutral-EA, and no-EA. Results suggested that students benefited from interacting with the affective EA in the IL game, in terms of learning motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention.

Specifically, by adopting the notion that safety and awareness are inherent and emergent properties of complex socio-technical systems, this paper introduces the novel concept of “risk SA provision”. It is also discussed that the risk SA provision capability is dynamic by nature. Lastly, the Überlingen mid-air collision accident is used to demonstrate that hazard analysis techniques can be employed to create a more detailed image of what constitutes the ‘ideal’ socio-technical system in terms of risk SA provision capabilities. Resting on safety science and control theory, this work suggests a list of system elements and characteristics, which enhance information flow, retrieval, and dissemination and contribute to maintaining the system in an ‘aware’ and safe state. It is also argued that since those system elements are tangible, it seems possible to found a new DSA assessment approach on the measurement of the risk SA provision capabilities of the system."

abstract = "Background
The intractable global road safety problem of the overrepresentation of young drivers in road crashes, despite a plethora of intervention, suggests that innovative approaches to understanding – and thus intervening in – road crash risks is required. The current research recognises that young drivers frequently are adolescents, and that adolescence is characterised by rapid physical, psychological, cognitive, and social development, each of which interacts with, contributes to, and is impacted upon by a wealth of negative, neutral and positive moods and emotions. The literature regarding relevant to adolescent drivers and emotions between 1 January 2005 and 30 September 2015 will be synthesise, in addition to posing future research questions regarding adolescents, emotions, and driving behaviour.
Results
One hundred and three peer-reviewed articles were identified, and these were summarised within emotions and the adolescent (44 papers); emotions, the adolescent, and driving risks (23 papers); emotions, the adolescent, and risky driving behaviour (30 papers); and emotions, the adolescent, and road safety interventions (6 papers). The findings were synthesised within the context of the characteristics of the adolescent driver, their emotions, the driving context and their driving behaviour, including a pictorial representation of two temporal models depicting the sequence via which emotions can impact upon adolescent driving behaviour (Path A in which the adolescent driver experiences emotions after entering the car; Path B in which the adolescent experiences emotions before entering the car).
Discussion and implications
The relatively recent proliferation of literature pertaining to adolescents, emotions, and their driving behaviour suggests that the breadth of research questions posed in relation to the domains of the adolescent driver, their emotions, the driving context, and their driving behaviour are timely. Indeed, recent applications of systems thinking within road safety, including young driver road safety specifically, maintain that a holistic approach to the understanding of who plays what role in this system that currently contributes to crash risks, and conversely can play a role in effective and efficient intervention, is essential before the real world realisation of a safe road system. Addressing these research questions are fundamental to sustaining progress on the path to young driver road crash prevention through a safe young driver road safety system."

The internal working models of self and others associated with insecure attachment may impact the processing of socially relevant information, particularly emotion conveyed in facial expressions. We investigated associations among child abuse, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and attention biases for emotion in an adult population. Specifically, we examined how self-reported attachment influences the relationship between childhood abuse and attention bias for emotion. A dot probe task consisting of happy, threatening, and neutral female facial stimuli was used to assess possible biases in attention for socially relevant stimuli. Our findings indicate that attachment anxiety moderated the relationship between maltreatment and attention bias for happy emotion; among individuals with a child abuse history, attachment anxiety significantly predicted an attention bias away from happy facial stimuli."

Introduction
Women with provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) report lower sexual arousal than nonaffected women, however, laboratory studies of arousal have reported contradictory results about whether group differences exist in genital and subjective arousal.
Aim
To examine genital and subjective sexual arousal in women with and without PVD.
Methods
Eligible women with and without PVD (N = 42) attended a laboratory session that included an interview, questionnaire completion, and genital imaging. A direct measure of superficial blood flow—laser Doppler imaging—was used to assess vulvar blood flow levels while participants watched three films, including an erotic film. Participants answered questions about their level of sexual arousal before, during, and after the erotic film.
Main Outcome Measures
Average vulvar blood flow levels during the baseline and erotic films, numerical ratings of subjective sexual arousal and anxiety, as well as questionnaire measures of arousal.
Results
There was a significant group difference in genital arousal, whereby the PVD group showed a lower genital response to the erotic film, as well as a significant interaction between baseline blood flow and group membership. Separate group regression analyses demonstrated that baseline blood flow explained a substantial amount of the variance in erotic film blood flow in the control group (70%), while only 27% was explained by this variable in the PVD group. There were no differences in subjective sexual arousal or anxiety between the groups. Across questionnaire measures, women with PVD reported lower sexual arousal than the control group.
Conclusions
The results suggest that women with PVD show lower genital responsiveness than nonaffected women to sexual stimuli in a laboratory setting and that their genital arousal is likely impacted by a number of biopsychosocial factors.

However, while often being quite clear on the characteristics of the two processes (‘Type 1’ processes are fast, autonomous, intuitive, etc. and ‘Type 2’ processes are slow, deliberative, analytic, etc.), dual-process theorists have been heavily criticized for being unclear on the factors that determine when an individual will think analytically or rely on their intuition. We address this issue by introducing a three-stage model that elucidates the bottom-up factors that cause individuals to engage Type 2 processing. According to the model, multiple Type 1 processes may be cued by a stimulus (Stage 1), leading to the potential for conflict detection (Stage 2). If successful, conflict detection leads to Type 2 processing (Stage 3), which may take the form of rationalization (i.e., the Type 1 output is verified post hoc) or decoupling (i.e., the Type 1 output is falsified). We tested key aspects of the model using a novel base-rate task where stereotypes and base-rate probabilities cued the same (non-conflict problems) or different (conflict problems) responses about group membership. Our results support two key predictions derived from the model: (1) conflict detection and decoupling are dissociable sources of Type 2 processing and (2) conflict detection sometimes fails. We argue that considering the potential stages of reasoning allows us to distinguish early (conflict detection) and late (decoupling) sources of analytic thought. Errors may occur at both stages and, as a consequence, bias arises from both conflict monitoring and decoupling failures."

After system designers create conceptual models, they or members of their design team corroborate the created models. System auditors also evaluate conceptual models. Little guidance exists to advise system designers and auditors on how to conduct such conceptual model validation. Mistakes in corroborating conceptual models may result in unnecessary changes to valid systems or in false assurance of invalid systems. Evidence from prior studies suggests that evaluators exhibit a cognitive bias that causes them to focus on structural constraints even when there is conflicting information in the surface semantics. Studies also show mixed results for whether relationships involving optional participation of entities are more difficult for users to comprehend than relationships with only mandatory participation. Decompositions of large representations may be easier to evaluate than are the large representations in their entirety. Because conceptual models often are portrayed as large representations that include relationships with optional participation of entities, these concerns must be investigated in the context of system evaluation. This study provides evidence of a debiasing technique for the tendency to focus only on structural constraints, and compares evaluation responses for entities’ optional and mandatory participation in relationships presented in decomposed versus full models."

Beginning with designing a functional neuroimaging study, the myriad considerations involved in the conceptual and experimental design of an informative study, from model development to task design, are discussed. Acquiring a functional neuroimaging data set delves into the selection and optimization of a specific imaging modality in best approaching problem‐solving. Postprocessing a functional neuroimaging data set deals with the specific stepwise processes by which acquired two-dimensional images are temporally and spatially processed/corrected to permit the subsequent analysis of functional information that is anatomically accurate in its localization and descriptive of the time-varying events comprising the study design. Statistical analysis of a functional neuroimaging data set considers the importance of statistical approaches to attributing brain states to behavioral states, and to defining the strength of study inferences, and data-analytical approaches to defining behavior as processes of functional segregation (modularity) versus integration of brain activity. Interpretation of a functional neuroimaging study deals with select topics such as reverse inference and the ethical implications of study interpretation."

Sensory processing and early encoding of speech into lexical representations are critical for robust SWR.

During reading, one typically has impression that eyes are gliding smoothly across the page. However, this is an incorrect impression; instead the eyes make a series of rapid movements (called saccades) separated by periods of time when the eyes are relatively still (called fixations). It is only during the fixations that new visual information is encoded from the text because vision is functionally suppressed during the saccades. Fixations typically last about 200–250 ms, although individual fixations in reading can be as short as 50–100 ms and as long as 500 ms. Distributions of fixation durations look like normal distributions (with the mean around 200–250 ms) that are skewed to the right. Typically, saccades last roughly 20–40 ms; the duration of the saccade depends almost exclusively on the size of the saccade. Saccades moving from the end of one line to the next (called return sweep) typically last longer than the movements that progress along a line, and they also tend to undershoot the intended target. Thus, a return sweep will often be followed by a corrective movement to the left (when reading English)."

Although it might be reasonable to use this heuristic to navigate simple and unambiguous facts, it might be risky when searching for conflicting socio-scientific topics, such as potential measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the present study, we explored the extent to which students consider other Web page characteristics, such as topic relevance and trustworthiness, when searching and bookmarking pages concerning a conflicting topic. We also examined the extent to which prior background knowledge moderates students’ behavior. The results revealed that while the study participants actually used a ‘top link’ heuristic to navigate the results, they engaged in more systematic processes to bookmark pages for further study. Furthermore, the students’ background knowledge was related to the assessment of Web page trustworthiness. We discuss these results from the perspective of a dual-processing model."

In neurocognitive psychology, manually collected cloze completion probabilities (CCPs) are the standard approach to quantifying a word’s predictability from sentence context. Here, we test a series of language models in accounting for CCPs, as well as the data they typically account for, i.e. electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye movement (EM) data. With this, we hope to render time-consuming CCP procedures unnecessary. We test a statistical n-gram language model, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, as well as a recurrent neural network (RNN) language model for correlation with the neurocognitive data."

Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding how readers and listeners do resolve meaning, often under the assumption that there is a single veridical meaning to be represented. Recently, there has been a greater focus on how the self-regulation of attention may give rise to different representations. Because aging is often associated with change in competencies and motivation that can affect such regulation, adult development can provide an interesting window into these processes."

This work addresses a systematic mapping of the literature for the summarization of results and discussion on research directions for the use of affective states and socio-emotional factors to support the development of intelligent CSCL environments. Six digital libraries were queried and 58 studies were deeply analyzed and categorized. Over 90% of the studies considered emotion and personality traits in the CSCL environment; most studies used personality recognition by questionnaires rather than automatic sources of inference; most technological approaches employed instruments to collect, analyze and/or represent emotions; and most papers that reported empirical experiments focused on “emotional awareness” and “interaction among students in a CSCL environment”. We have identified three main challenges to be addressed by the community in the next decade for an adequate incorporation of affective states in CSCL environments: emotional awareness, orchestration of students' interaction and group formation."

In study 2, participants (N = 98) followed the same procedure as study 1, but they were allowed to view the experimental materials online, rather than in a lab setting. Results from both studies revealed that, while decorative graphics may appear benign or detrimental to learning outcomes immediately after exposure under experimental lab conditions, further analysis indicated that graphics designed to metaphorically correspond to text content functioned to preserve learning across a one-week delay. In addition, when participants viewed the materials online, the decorative graphics improved learning, not just prevented decay. The online effect was mediated by the level of metaphorical correspondence between the passage and the graphic."

To assess the hypothesis that functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), one component of arousal, is atypical in ADHD, we carried out a systematic review of the literature on 55 studies investigating electro-dermal, heart rate and pupillometry measures under different experimental conditions (resting-state, cognitive tasks and in response to reinforcers or socio-emotional stimuli). Our literature review identified ANS dysfunction in individuals with ADHD, more often in the direction of hypo-arousal than hyper-arousal, particularly at rest and during tasks requiring response regulation and sustained attention. Almost half of the reported findings were null. Stimulant medications increased ANS activity and, in some studies, reinforcers and rewards produced a similar effect, suggesting that ANS function can be modified in ADHD. Further research is needed to assess the influence of comorbid symptoms and to explore methodological parameters that may influence findings."

Results showed that both speech-based agents not only enhance driver situation awareness and driving performance, but also reduce their anger level and perceived workload.

We then turn to a discussion of the “central” dyslexias, including deep, surface, and phonological dyslexia that are typically associated with impairments in basic language faculties such as semantics and phonology. Mechanistic accounts of the dyslexias, including well-described computational accounts of the central dyslexias, are discussed.

After studying, participants reported their levels of surprise, curiosity, and confusion during learning, the extent to which they used self-reported critical thinking and elaboration strategies, and again completed the misconceptions measure. Individuals studying the refutation text experienced more surprise and changed more misconceptions to correct conceptions compared to participants studying the expository text. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that text type moderated the mediated relations between task value and surprise, curiosity, self-reported critical thinking and elaboration. Task value was positively related to surprise in the refutation condition but negatively related to surprise in the expository condition. Additionally, curiosity positively predicted self-reported critical thinking and elaboration strategies in the refutation condition but not in the expository condition. Results demonstrate that epistemic emotions play a significant role in conceptual change."

The current study examined processing of code-switching in Spanish-English bilingual children (ages 6;0–11;10) using an auditory moving window paradigm. Cognitive control was indexed by the Dimensional Change Card Sort. Children exhibited significant costs in processing speed when listening to code-switched sentences, but no costs in a measure of offline comprehension. The extent to which cognitive control skills moderated processing costs depended on the robustness of the language system: children with higher language skills exhibited a greater moderating effect of cognitive control. Taken together, the findings provide limited support for a role of cognitive control in children’s code-switching processing and suggest that the processing costs incurred may be transitory."

Building on and grounded by the analyzed literature, we theorize an integrated taxonomy on guidance design features. Applying the taxonomy, we discuss existing empirical results, identify effects of different guidance design features, and propose opportunities for future research. Overall, this article contributes to research and practice.

In the current study we address the question whether presenting a highly familiar face vs. a stranger enhances the effects of gaze cues on object processing in 4-month-olds. Infants were presented pictures of the infant's caregiver and another infant's caregiver (stranger) either turning eye gaze toward an object next to the face or looking away from the object. Then objects were presented again without the face and event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. An enhanced positive slow wave (PSW) was found for objects that were not cued by the caregiver's eye gaze, indicating that these objects required increased encoding compared to objects that were cued by the caregiver's gaze. When a stranger was presented, a PSW was observed in response to objects regardless of whether the objects were gaze-cued or not. Thus, the caregiver's eye gaze had a larger effect on infants’ object processing than the stranger's gaze. This suggests that at 4 months of age the caregiver's eye gaze is easier to process for infants, more salient, or both. The findings are discussed in terms of early social cognitive development and face processing models."

N = 52 students learned twice for 30 min in a hypermedia either receiving prompts or learning without. In each session, self-efficacy was assessed before, during, and after learning while performance was measured at the end. Prompted learners outperformed learners without prompts only in the first performance test regarding transfer. Additionally, they reported higher overall self-efficacy. While self-efficacy perceptions did not differ between groups in the first learning session, self-efficacy perceptions in the second learning session were higher amongst prompted learners. Results indicate that learning with prompts may foster self-efficacy across learning sessions. Navigation behavior did not differ between groups.

To present evidence supporting best-practices for prescription drug labeling and educational materials.
Methods
Articles were selected from three online databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL). Eligible manuscripts were: 1) English-language, 2) randomized, controlled trials, and 3) focused on improving prescription drug labeling practices.
Results
Forty-nine articles were reviewed, and included both regulated label materials and pharmacy or health systems-generated tools. Best-practices included use of plain language principles, typographic cues, quantitative descriptors, and standardized formats, when applicable. Common outcomes included preference and comprehension, while few studies examined actual medication use (e.g. adherence, harms) or clinical health outcomes. Approximately half of studies directly engaged patients’ perspectives in intervention development, which may have helped increase tool effectiveness.
Conclusions
Several best practices were apparent in the literature, particularly for written materials and pharmacy-generated container labeling. Design principles for supplemental instructions and multimedia tools were less cohesive, albeit less researched. The impact of patient involvement in tool design is promising, though requiring further study.
Practice implications
Definitive studies to inform practice standards on how to best communicate medication information to consumers are needed, especially as communication modalities continue to evolve. Increased research on if and how to incorporate patient-centered decision-making into the development process should be considered."

abstract = "By convention, the term “sentence processing” refers to the subfield of psycholinguistics focusing on the interpretation of sentences. A range of information sources is used for successful sentence processing. Lexical and syntactic constraints are central for defining the structural alternatives, and information associated with the prosody of the sentence as well as the discourse and visual context in which the sentence occurs reinforces some interpretations and fleshes out the meaning of the sentence. Approaches to sentence processing differ regarding whether they assume serial versus parallel and modular versus interactive architectures; almost all assume incremental interpretation and even prediction of structure and lexical content. Current models include the garden-path model, constraint-based models, and approaches that allow the processing system to reduce and even distort the input (Good-Enough Processing; Noisy Channel Models). An important trend is work designed to shed light on how sentence processing is implemented in the brain."

abstract = "Breathing rate and depth influence the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood, altering cerebral blood flow and thus functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Such respiratory fluctuations can have substantial influence in studies of fMRI signal covariance in subjects at rest, the so-called “resting state functional connectivity” technique. If respiration is monitored during fMRI scanning, it is typically done using a belt about the subject’s abdomen to record abdominal circumference. Several measures have been derived from these belt records, including the windowed envelope of the waveform (ENV), the windowed variance in the waveform (respiration variation, RV), and a measure of the amplitude of each breath divided by the cycle time of the breath (respiration volume per time, RVT). Any attempt to gauge respiratory contributions to fMRI signals requires a respiratory measure, but little is known about how these measures compare to each other, or how they perform beyond the small studies in which they were initially proposed. Here, we examine the properties of these measures in hundreds of healthy young adults scanned for an hour each at rest, a subset of the Human Connectome Project chosen for having high-quality physiological records. We find: 1) ENV, RV, and RVT are all correlated, and ENV and RV are more highly correlated to each other than to RVT; 2) respiratory events like deep breaths exhibit characteristic heart rate elevations, fMRI signal changes, head motions, and image quality abnormalities time-locked to large deflections in the belt traces; 3) all measures can “miss” deep breaths; 4) RVT “misses” deep breaths more than ENV or RV; 5) all respiratory measures change systematically over the course of a 14.4-min scan. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature and ways to move forward in modeling respiratory influences on fMRI scans."
