Our modeling indicates that the assumption that words in text are processed serially by skilled readers is a viable and attractive hypothesis, as it accounts not only for “normal” reading data, but also for the pattern of decrements that occur when text is withheld from view during certain periods of time, such as in the boundary paradigm and the disappearing text paradigm. Our analyses also indicate (a) that lexical processing during reading is essentially continuous and (b) that the trigger for eye movements has to be a different (and prior) event to the trigger for shifts of covert spatial attention. In addition, the parameter values in our model are in accordance with what is known about such processes and should be taken as serious hypotheses for how long these processes last. Although a parallel model may be able to duplicate the predictions of the E-Z Reader model, we think that it is likely to be far less parsimonious and not nearly as good a heuristic device for using eye movements to understand language processing in reading."

OCT-Angiography (OCTA) is one such method that has rapidly gained clinical acceptance since it was approved by the FDA in late 2016. OCTA images are based on the variable backscattering of light from the vascular and neurosensory tissue in the retina. Since the intensity and phase of backscattered light from retinal tissue varies based on the intrinsic movement of the tissue (e.g. red blood cells are moving, but neurosensory tissue is static), OCTA images are essentially motion-contrast images. This motion-contrast imaging provides reliable, high resolution, and non-invasive images of the retinal vasculature in an efficient manner. In many cases, these images are approaching histology level resolution. This unprecedented resolution coupled with the simple, fast and non-invasive imaging platform have allowed a host of basic and clinical research applications. OCTA demonstrates many important clinical findings including areas of macular telangiectasia, impaired perfusion, microaneurysms, capillary remodeling, some types of intraretinal fluid, and neovascularization among many others. More importantly, OCTA provides depth-resolved information that has never before been available. Correspondingly, OCTA has been used to evaluate a spectrum of retinal vascular diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal venous occlusion (RVO), uveitis, retinal arterial occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration among others. In this review, we will discuss the methods used to create OCTA images, the practical applications of OCTA in light of invasive dye-imaging studies (e.g. fluorescein angiography) and review clinical studies demonstrating the utility of OCTA for research and clinical practice."

The goal of regular clinical use requires to adopt a user-centered design approach. This comprises an in-depth analysis of the tasks to be solved and the target user group. Task analysis methods, such as observation and interviews, are discussed to enable readers to identify, which diagnostic or treatment processes are essential, which decisions have to be taken, which criteria are essential for such decisions, which information is needed to support such decisions, and how this information shall be displayed. The design and development of prototypes should be carried out only based on verified assumptions about the essential usage scenarios. This process usually starts with some kind of representation of the current solution, e.g., a workflow diagram or, more informally, a set of user stories. The process continues with a representation of user needs and their priorities as well as a representation of the envisioned solution. Thus, user interface design is much more than a nice visual wrap-up for some algorithms. It is instead a complex and highly iterative process, which requires early and continuous feedback from the target user group and other relevant stakeholders. Users of medical visualization systems are medical doctors from a specific discipline, such as radiology, surgery, nuclear medicine or radiation treatment, who use such tools for diagnosis support, treatment planning, and follow-up studies to evaluate the success of treatment. There are, of course, strong differences between research settings, where requirements may be vague, and more product-oriented developments, where precise functional goals and usability goals drive the whole process. We cover both situations but slightly focus on research projects. Among the many interaction techniques developed so far, 3D interaction is particularly relevant for medical visualization. Thus, we discuss 3D selection, 3D transformation and navigation. While in current practice, most medical visualization systems are operated with keyboard and mouse, more advanced input and output devices, e.g., 3D input devices, have great potential. Thus, we give an overview of such devices and the experiences gained in medical applications. A specially challenging situation for medical visualization is intraoperative use, where devices need to be sterile and surgeons need to focus on the patient. Interaction techniques and devices for these settings are also described. Finally, we discuss the evaluation of interaction techniques and user interfaces."

Rather than viewing automaticity as a unitary construct, we follow a social cognition perspective (Bargh, 1994) that argues for four theoretically independent features of automaticity: unconscious (processing of emotional stimuli occurs outside awareness), efficient (processing emotional meaning uses minimal attentional resources), unintentional (no goal is needed to engage in processing emotional meaning), and uncontrollable (limited ability to avoid, alter or terminate processing emotional stimuli). Our review of the literature suggests that most anxiety disorders are characterized by uncontrollable, and likely also unconscious and unintentional, biased processing of threat-relevant information. In contrast, MDD is most clearly typified by uncontrollable, but not unconscious or unintentional, processing of negative information. For the anxiety disorders and for MDD, there is no sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about efficiency of processing, though early indications are that neither anxiety disorders nor MDD are characterized by this feature. Clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are offered. In particular, it is clear that paradigms that more directly delineate the different features of automaticity are required to gain a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the importance of automatic processing in emotion dysregulation."

This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb."

abstract = "An historical discussion is provided of the intellectual trends that caused nineteenth century interdisciplinary studies of physics and psychobiology by leading scientists such as Helmholtz, Maxwell, and Mach to splinter into separate twentieth-century scientific movements. The nonlinear, nonstationary, and nonlocal nature of behavioral and brain data are emphasized. Three sources of contemporary neural network research—the binary, linear, and continuous-nonlinear models—are noted. The remainder of the article describes results about continuous-nonlinear models: Many models of content-addressable memory are shown to be special cases of the Cohen-Grossberg model and global Liapunov function, including the additive, brain-state-in-a-box, McCulloch-Pitts, Boltzmann machine, Hartline-Ratliff-Miller, shunting, masking field, bidirectional associative memory, Volterra-Lotka, Gilpin-Ayala, and Eigen-Schuster models. A Liapunov functional method is described for proving global limit or oscillation theorems for nonlinear competitive systems when their decision schemes are globally consistent or inconsistent, respectively. The former case is illustrated by a model of a globally stable economic market, and the latter case is illustrated by a model of the voting paradox. Key properties of shunting competitive feedback networks are summarized, including the role of sigmoid signalling, automatic gain control, competitive choice and quantization, tunable filtering, total activity normalization, and noise suppression in pattern transformation and memory storage applications. Connections to models of competitive learning, vector quantization, and categorical perception are noted. Adaptive resonance theory (ART) models for self-stabilizing adaptive pattern recognition in response to complex real-time nonstationary input environments are compared with off-line models such as autoassociators, the Boltzmann machine, and back propagation. Special attention is paid to the stability and capacity of these models, and to the role of top-down expectations and attentional processing in the active regulation of both learning and fast information processing. Models whose performance and learning are regulated by internal gating and matching signals, or by external environmentally generated error signals, are contrasted with models whose learning is regulated by external teacher signals that have no analog in natural real-time environments. Examples from sensory-motor control of adaptive vector encoders, adaptive coordinate transformations, adaptive gain control by visual error signals, and automatic generation of synchronous multijoint movement trajectories illustrate the former model types. Internal matching processes are shown capable of discovering several different types of invariant environmental properties. These include ART mechanisms which discover recognition invariants, adaptive vector encoder mechanisms which discover movement invariants, and autoreceptive associative mechanisms which discover invariants of self-regulating target position maps."

This chapter takes a look at how one conceives of a new VR application, whether it is drawn from a different medium, or from another VR application, or is generated from scratch. As an aid in doing this, we enumerate a number of application areas and provide a number of exemplary VR experiences to inspire, and to show ideas and techniques. Additionally, we address a process for each of these methods. The chapter provides a method and workflow that integrates the following guidelines, each of which is elucidated and expanded:Design deliberately;Prototype;Design with the system in mind;Design with the venue in mind;Design with the audience in mind;Design to engage the audience;Consider social interactions;Consider design tradeoffs;Design the user objective;Design the end of the experience;Employ User testing;Document, deploy, and evaluate the experience.

Decision response and eye gaze data were analyzed and correlated. Results of a first experiment point to the inability of the human operator to visually ignore aircraft which are seen to converge on a plan view, even if they are obviously at very different altitudes, or aircraft which are moving as a group even though maintaining separation. In the second experiment we studied the effects of predictive warnings of differing reliabilities and different timing on both anticipation decisions and eye movements. Results showed that the early warning directed visual attention to the pair of targets, but did not elicit responses unless it was entirely reliable. Detection of collisions was not affected by the timing of the warning, but only by the reliability of the warning system. However, visual search patterns differed markedly between early and late warnings."

This paper attempts to address this problem by introducing the Stochastic, Hierarchical Architecture for Reading Eye-movements (SHARE). The SHARE framework formalizes reading eye movements as observable outcomes of a latent stochastic process. By modeling eye movements as time-series random variables, the goal of the model is to uncover statistical regularities in the data, which help to identify conditions and constraints the underlying mechanism must satisfy. In the univariate analysis, it is shown that a 3-component Lognormal mixture model provides a good fit to the marginal distribution function of fixation duration, and a hierarchical model is required for modeling saccade length. As a comprehensive model of reading eye movements, SHARE was implemented as an Input–Output Hidden Markov model. With a few simple hypotheses, SHARE is able to capture reading eye-movement patterns of beginning readers and proficient adults, and to reproduce well-known psycholinguistic effects. The rationale of the model, its relations with other modeling endeavors, and its implications are discussed."

This chapter provides an overview of research in cardiac surgery devices. An explosion in multidisciplinary research, combining mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering with physiology and medicine, during the 1960's created huge advances in modern health care.

The latest and leading technology presents robots intend to keep the surgeon in the most comfortable, dexterous, and ergonomic position during the entire procedure. The branch of the medical and rehabilitation robotics includes the manipulators and robots providing surgery, therapy, prosthetics, and rehabilitation. As the field of surgery robots controlled by surgeons expands, the economical cost is expected to reduce, which will allow surgeons to more commonly use teleoperation in situations that warrants professional staff assistance such as wars, epidemics, and space trips. The situation of “no contact” between the medical personnel and the patient reduces the risk of loss of health because of the infection(s) from the side of the operating staff."

This chapter focuses on how information made available during the word recognition process is used in sentence processing. The difference in acceptability reflects the specific knowledge about the verbs, which defines how they can be used and specifically, whether or not they can have a direct object. The body of knowledge forms the word's lexical representation in long-term memory. The chapter is primarily concerned with “combinatory knowledge,” the subset of lexical knowledge that specifies how words are used in sentences. The combinatory knowledge associated with verbs is particularly interesting because it provides information about both structural and conceptual aspects of the sentence. The chapter describes the phrase attachment and clause closure, and the role of argument structure and verb control information in sentence processing."

Many methods have been proposed, but most of them do not take the architectural specificities of an agent-based interactive system into account, nor do they focus on the link between architecture and evaluation. In this paper, we present an agent-based architecture model for interactive systems. Then, based on this architecture, we propose a generic, reconfigurable evaluation environment, called EISEval, designed and developed to help evaluators analyze and evaluate certain aspects of interactive systems in general and of agent-based architecture interactive systems in particular: User Interface (UI), non-functional properties (e.g., response time, complexity) and user characteristics (e.g., abilities, preferences, progress). System designers can draw useful conclusions from the evaluation results to improve the system. This environment was applied to evaluate an agent-based interactive system used to supervise an urban transport network in a study organized in laboratory."

IBLT proposes five learning mechanisms in the context of a decision-making process: instance-based knowledge, recognition-based retrieval, adaptive strategies, necessity-based choice, and feedback updates. IBLT suggests in DDM people learn with the accumulation and refinement of instances, containing the decision-making situation, action, and utility of decisions. As decision makers interact with a dynamic task, they recognize a situation according to its similarity to past instances, adapt their judgment strategies from heuristic-based to instance-based, and refine the accumulated knowledge according to feedback on the result of their actions. The IBLT’s learning mechanisms have been implemented in an ACT-R cognitive model. Through a series of experiments, this paper shows how the IBLT’s learning mechanisms closely approximate the relative trend magnitude and performance of human data. Although the cognitive model is bounded within the context of a dynamic task, the IBLT is a general theory of decision making applicable to other dynamic environments."

abstract = "Accounts of comprehension failure, whether in the case of readers with poor skill or when syntactic complexity is high, have overwhelmingly implicated working memory capacity as the key causal factor. However, extant research suggests that this position is not well supported by evidence on the span of active memory during online sentence processing, nor is it well motivated by models that make explicit claims about the memory mechanisms that support language processing. The current study suggests that sensitivity to interference from similar items in memory may provide a better explanation of comprehension failure. Through administration of a comprehensive skill battery, we found that the previously observed association of working memory with comprehension is likely due to the collinearity of working memory with many other reading-related skills, especially IQ. In analyses which removed variance shared with IQ, we found that receptive vocabulary knowledge was the only significant predictor of comprehension performance in our task out of a battery of 24 skill measures. In addition, receptive vocabulary and non-verbal memory for serial order—but not simple verbal memory or working memory—were the only predictors of reading times in the region where interference had its primary affect. We interpret these results in light of a model that emphasizes retrieval interference and the quality of lexical representations as key determinants of successful comprehension."

The present study was designed to examine these processes. We used a modified spatial cueing task to assess the speed of engagement and disengagement from supraliminal and masked pictorial cues depicting threat, dysphoria, or neutral content in 36 clinically anxious, 41 depressed and 41 control participants. Participants were randomly assigned to a stress or neutral condition. During stress, anxious participants were slow to disengage from masked left hemifield pictures depicting threat or dysphoria, but were quick to disengage from supraliminal threat pictures. Information processing in anxious participants during stress was characterized by early selective attention of emotional stimuli, occurring prior to full conscious awareness, followed by effortful avoidance of threat. Depressed participants were distinct from the anxious group, displaying selective attention for stimuli depicting dysphoria, but not threat, during the neutral condition. In sum, attentional biases in clinical populations are associated with difficulties in the disengagement component of visual orienting. Further, a vigilant-avoidant pattern of attentional bias may represent a strategic attempt to compensate for the early activation of a fear response."

Theoretically integrating concepts and empirical findings from social and cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and related disciplines, the current chapter introduces the QUEST model, an organizing framework for strategic thinking. In the QUEST model, decision-makers think about strategic phenomena by asking and answering, implicitly or explicitly, three questions that draw on game-theoretic concepts: Who are the players? What are their options? How do choices relate to outcomes? I use the QUEST model to organize existing knowledge on strategic thinking in five sections. Section 1 provides definitions and introduces the QUEST model. Section 2 addresses decision-makers’ thinking about the players, reviewing research on attention allocation and mind-reading processes in strategic interactions. Section 3 reviews research on the depth and breadth of strategic thinking, discussing how decision-makers generate options, evaluate options, and think iteratively about their own and others’ options. Section 4 addresses how decision-makers’ cognitive constraints and social motives lead them to misrepresent and transform the given outcomes, as well as what games decision-makers think they are playing in ambiguous, real-world strategic interactions. Section 5 considers additional components of strategic interactions; addresses the possibility of changing the rules of the game; and concludes with open research questions."

Target discrimination (d′) and response disinhibition (C) were calculated using a signal detection analysis. Based on questionnaire responses, there were no differences between groups in depression, anxiety, smoking or drinking, but WWP reported significantly more screen and gaming time (17.31h/week versus 4.12 among NP). WWP had faster reaction time (RT) and better discrimination of targets from distracters (high d′) but also showed higher disinhibition (low C). WWP also showed cognitive-bias toward game-related words in the form of higher d′ for WoW jargon than common English and more disinhibition to positive-valence WoW jargon. Similar to past studies which have found alcoholics to have cognitive biases toward alcohol-related words, WWP who play frequently showed cognitive biases toward words related to the World of Warcraft game."

Studies 3 and 4 identified two moderators (vividness of advertisement, dieting status of participants) of the relationship between affect intensity and consumption-related outcomes. In Study 3 high affect intensity individuals reported stronger food cravings only in response to vivid advertising appeals. In Study 4, respondents with high levels of positive affectivity, a sub-dimension of affect intensity, experienced increased salivation, but especially when they were dieters exposed to vivid food images.

Age-related changes differ across individuals, and some cognitive functions are primarily spared, whereas others show different trajectories of decline. Some changes attributed to aging result from disease, whereas others reflect cohort differences. Aging commonly brings losses of peripheral sensory functions critical to reading or listening—vision and hearing. With aging, time increases on tasks and the number of items immediately accessible in memory decreases. Reading is a complex, everyday activity. The great number of subsystems working together to form a cohesive understanding of extended discourse might be expected to create a substantial decrease in the processing speed and proficiency of older readers. The problem, however, comes when research attempts to isolate the relationship between reading and the declines resulting from aging. One of the reasons is that reading offers so many variables, such as topic interest, text length, text structure, readability, presentation method, and purpose."

The data show that language history affects the way readers assign structure to ambiguous syntactic constituents, but in different ways off-line and on-line. Off-line, bilinguals depart from the monolingual model in their attachment of relative clauses in their non-dominant language, and exhibit language-independent strategy use—with input in either language, bilinguals have behavior patterns similar to those of monolinguals of their dominant language. On-line, however, bilinguals appear to have no reliable attachment preferences, unlike monolinguals, who uniformly prefer attachment to the low site. The bilinguals' departure from the monolingual model is not taken to be indicative of a qualitative difference between monolingual and bilingual sentence processing. Instead, this result is attributed to a lack of sensitivity in the experimental procedure, which taps early processing with monolinguals, but misses the opportunity with bilinguals, whose reading times are overall slower."

An IoT Reference Model serves as a description of main IoT system entities and their relationships. The most complete IoT reference model is the model from the IoT-A research project funded by the European Commission and on which part of this chapter is based. The model contains a set of submodels such as the IoT Domain, Communication, Information, Functional, and Security models. The Domain Model describes the IoT world as a collection of Physical Entities represented in the digital world as Virtual Entities. The Users (humans or applications) are interested in monitoring and interacting with the Physical Entities through Services. Services are the interfaces of the Resources deployed on the network or on Sensor/Actuator/Tag devices deployed for the purposes of monitoring and interacting with the Physical Entities. Apart from the Domain Model, the Communication, Information, Functional, and Security models are also described. An IoT Reference Architecture describes the different views of an IoT system architecture that address the concerns of the system stakeholders, whether these are the developers, users, administrators, sponsors, etc. In this chapter, the functional, informational, deployment, and operational views of IoT-A are presented in detail, while other views such as the Physical Entity and Context views are highly dependent on the actual system requirements and parameters, and they are therefore only briefly mentioned. While the IoT-A ARM presents an Information Technology (IT) reference architecture the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) Reference Architecture (IIRA) presents the Operational Technology (OT) counterpart. The IIRA is briefly presented and compared to the IoT-A."

The progressive left-to-right movements of human eyes are demanded by the way that human writing system has developed. This chapter questions whether people make progressive or regressive fixations. “Parafoveal” vision is able to deliver sufficient information to the mechanism that decides the location of the next fixation. Measurement-related and methodological issues discuss the merits and potential problems of oculomotor measures commonly used to index cognitive processes in reading, including fixation probability, single, first and second fixation duration, gaze duration, total viewing duration, and “repair time.” The chapter focuses on three sources. First, the conditions under which a regressive fixation is made, second, the conditions under which word skipping occurs, and third, the variation of the landing position within the next word. Whether semantic information can be collected with extrafoveal vision is represented both in the discussions of reading and in discussions of scene perception. In both cases the data are equivocal."

This chapter focuses on the “How” question, that is, the question of what cognitive processes intervene between mere co-occurrence and attitude formation or change. Though EC has typically been thought of as occurring through a single, albeit contentious, mechanism, we begin by pointing out that both the heterogeneity of EC methodologies and the abundance of inconsistent results suggest that multiple processes with different characteristics can produce EC. We describe how the earliest posited process of EC, Pavlovian conditioning or signal learning, is a valid mechanism of EC that appears to have operated in some experiments but is unlikely to have operated in others and also cannot account for various EC findings. We describe other mechanisms of EC, when they can be expected to occur, and what characteristics they have. We particularly focus our attention on a process model of EC we have recently introduced, the implicit misattribution model. Finally, we describe the implications of a multiprocess view of EC, which we argue can help resolve theoretical controversies and further the application of EC as a practical intervention for influencing attitudes in various domains."

This chapter shows that skilled and expert performers acquire complex skills and neurological/physiological adaptations that transform the mediating cognitive mechanisms and associated brain regions to make them qualitatively different from the processes and representations traditionally examined in the laboratory studies of memory. It argues that the development of expert performance drives the acquisition of mechanisms that allow experts to meet the demands of representative task performance, where memory is only one aspect of a highly integrated system that mediates superior task performance and its acquisition. This chapter begins by sketching the rationale for the original mainstream approach in experimental psychology that searched for basic nonmodifiable human capacities and processes. It also discusses recent empirical evidence on the effects of practice and adaptation, and demonstrates that under certain external conditions, biological systems—including those of human children and adults—are capable of dramatic change, even at the cellular level. Finally, this chapter discusses how integrated structures and mechanisms are acquired through deliberate practice, and why a general scientific description of the mediating mechanisms underlying skilled performance requires studying a variety of expert domains."

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence."

This chapter discusses eye movements and perceptual multistability. A multistable or reversible pattern is one that can give rise to more than one interpretation. From the figures, illustrated in the chapter, the differential blurring in the perceived image that is due to visual inhomogeneity can be interpreted as a sort of bias unavoidably introduced in the image by the visual system. Therefore, the perceived image of a multistable figure is always biased no matter how hard one tries to create a purely ambiguous figure. This bias, however, has a different sign depending on what location one actually fixates when looking at the figure. If the available high spatial-frequency information determines the interpretation of a figure then, in practice, fixation on a given location of the figure is about the same as covering the figure with an opaque mask with a round hole that leaves visible only a small portion of it."

One concerns the manifestation, in normal people, of ‘psychotic’ characteristics and their measurement using scales which, unlike the Eysenck P scale, draw their items from the clinical symptomatology of psychosis. Recent work on the so-called ‘borderline states’ is considered especially relevant and a new two-scale questionnaire (STQ) is described which was modelled on the current distinction, in DSM-III, between ‘schizotypal personality disorder’ and ‘borderline personality disorder’. The second theme addressed concerns the possible biological basis of individual differences in ‘schizotypy’. It is argued, in the light of some emerging views about the nature of schizophrenia, that this may lie in the functional and structural properties of hemisphere organization. A suggested strategy for evaluating this theory is an examination of the performance of schizotypal normal Ss on tests of hemisphere function."

The present research reports three experiments on the comprehension of French subject relative clauses and two forms of object relative clauses. In French, object relative clauses can be constructed with either a canonical subject-verb order, as in English, or with an inverted verb-subject order. Three self-paced reading tasks used this last structure, along with canonical object relatives (Experiment 1) and with subject relatives (Experiment 1, 2, 3) in a center-embedding construction. Comprehension accuracy rates and reading times were recorded in order to test predictions drawn from the Competition Model of Bates and MacWhinney (1982, Language Acquisition: The State of Art, pp. 173–218, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987, Mechanisms of Language Acquisition, pp. 157–193, Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; 1989, The Cross-linguistic Study of Sentence Processing, pp. 3–73, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge). Experiment 1 was intended to test the hypothesis that competition between NPs, memory load and perspective maintenance were the main determinants of the difficulty of role assignment in reversible relative clauses. In Experiment 2 and 3, subject relatives and inverted object relatives were compared, with several cues varied to evaluate their effect on role assignment."

Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing—with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices."

Two experiments compare the out-of-sample choice prediction accuracies of both methods and in both cases the DDM method outperforms a logistic prediction method. Furthermore, the DDM allows for out-of-sample process predictions. Both experiments validate the DDM as a method for predicting out-of-sample response times."

This chapter emphasizes the representations that are formed, as people understand a sentence and the processes involved in developing these representations. This involves recognizing the words in the sentence, determining the syntactic and semantic relationships among the words and phrases, and interpreting contextually dependent expressions. These processes draw upon specifically linguistic knowledge as well as knowledge about the world and the specific context of a sentence or utterance. This chapter also discusses the central theoretical perspectives and empirical questions that are guiding current research on sentence comprehension, and some historical perspective on how the field has developed. In doing so, it focuses primarily on the problem of how readers and listeners determine grammatical relationships as they are processing a sentence. In addition, the chapter also addresses the questions of how people pronounce words and nonwords, the effects of brain injury on performance, the role of phonological and morphological information in word recognition, the effects of differences among orthographies, the use of different decoding strategies, and the role of contextual information."

Both Pashler and Cowan suggested simple formulas for estimating capacity with these models. However, in many cases, these simple formulas are inadequate, and may lead to inefficient or biased estimation of working memory capacity. I propose a Bayesian hierarchical alternative to the Pashler and Cowan formulas, and show that the hierarchical model outperforms the traditional formulas. The models are easy to use and appropriate for a wide range of experimental designs. An easy-to-use graphical user interface for fitting the hierarchical model to data is available."

The ERPs in the normal and high-language proficiency groups were similar for early sensory related processing but differed in the later components thought to be more closely related to lexical access and post-lexical processing. The findings for the ERP waveforms suggest that adults with high-language proficiency show slightly faster lexical access over left anterior brain regions for closed class items, and a reduced reliance on contextual information contained in sentences."

abstract = "Psychological research on behavior has waned in recent decades. One underappreciated reason for this trend is that the field lacks a general-purpose framework targeted to the study of behavior. This chapter presents one such framework, a metatheory called the I3 Model (pronounced “I-cubed model”), which suggests that all behavior emerges from a combination of three orthogonal processes. Instigation encompasses the effects of exposure to a particular target object in a particular context that normatively affords a certain behavior. Impellance encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors that increase the likelihood that (or the intensity with which) the individual experiences a proclivity to enact the behavior when encountering that target object in that context. Inhibition encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors that increase the likelihood that (or the extent to which) people will override this proclivity, thereby reducing or eliminating the behavior’s enactment. According to “Perfect Storm Theory,” which is derived from the I3 Model, the highest likelihood or intensity of behavior emerges when instigation and impellance are strong and inhibition is weak. The generativity and integrative potential of the I3 Model and Perfect Storm Theory are illustrated with novel reviews of the literatures on aggression and eating behavior."

Although our knowledge of stigmatizing applicant characteristics that elicit subgroup differences has grown exponentially, research continuously highlights the need for a framework underlying interview bias. This paper proposes a framework for interview bias based on the dual-process theory, which is a widely applicable theoretical framework that has influenced research on social interactions, information processing, and decision making. Specifically, we investigate how stigmatizing applicant characteristics affect interviewers' information processing during the three main stages of the interview (i.e., pre-interview, interview, decision making), we discuss situational and interviewer factors as moderators, and describe the impact on interview outcomes (like interview bias). Building on the dual-process theory, we formulate key propositions, related to each of the interview stages. Finally, we discuss the implications of this framework for future interview and stigma research and for organizations' interviewing practice."

abstract = "The hippocampus has traditionally been thought to be critical for conscious explicit memory but not necessary for unconscious implicit memory processing. In a recent study of a group of mild amnesia patients with evidence of MTL damage limited to the hippocampus, subjects were tested on a direct test of item recognition confidence while electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired, and revealed intact measures of explicit memory from 400 to 600ms (mid-frontal old–new effect, FN400). The current investigation re-analyzed this data to study event-related potentials (ERPs) of implicit memory, using a recently developed procedure that eliminated declarative memory differences. Prior ERP findings from this technique were first replicated in two independent matched control groups, which exhibited reliable implicit memory effects in posterior scalp regions from 400 to 600ms, which were topographically dissociated from the explicit memory effects of familiarity. However, patients were found to be dramatically impaired in implicit memory effects relative to control subjects, as quantified by a reliable condition × group interaction. Several control analyses were conducted to consider alternative factors that could account for the results, including outliers, sample size, age, or contamination by explicit memory, and each of these factors was systematically ruled out. Results suggest that the hippocampus plays a fundamental role in aspects of memory processing that are beyond conscious awareness. The current findings therefore indicate that both memory systems of implicit and explicit memory may rely upon the same neural structures – but function in different physiological ways."

No study has yet considered the effects of unanticipated ambient media. To bridge this gap, the present article reports a field experiment entailing the manipulation of three types of ambient media that create different levels of surprise. The analysis combines observation data for 2,464 passersby, survey data from 305 respondents, and sales figures for 730 days. The results show that surprising ambient media draw attention, promote positive attitudes toward the ad, and stimulate word of mouth. Most importantly, ambient media increase purchase intention and sales revenue. Robustness checks ensure that the model is stable across several conditions, such as time of day or weather conditions. Follow-up studies further reveal that surprise elicits positive effects via two processes; the amplification of accompanying evaluations and the interplay of attention and incongruence resolution. The paper provides guidance for retailers wishing to design surprising ambient media that improve consumer attitudes and profitability."

Our goal was to investigate whether the neural correlates of ambiguity are also modulated by representational distance as a function of syntactic similarity (i.e., grammatical class) and meaning dominance. In an event-related fMRI experiment, participants completed a visual lexical decision task that included balanced and unbalanced noun–noun and noun–verb homonyms, unambiguous words, and nonwords. Syntactic similarity effects were observed in left inferior frontal regions, with greater activation for noun–verb than noun–noun homonyms. Meaning dominance effects were observed in left middle and superior temporal regions, with greater activation for balanced than unbalanced homonyms. These findings indicate that the behavioral cost associated with processing ambiguous word meanings, modulated by syntactic similarity and meaning dominance, is reflected in the neural systems underlying ambiguity processing, as frontal and temporal regions are recruited by increased competition as a function of representational distance."

Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes—and not attachment processes—independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed."

By contrast, his pattern recognition was good. The patients selective impairments are consistent with the view that prefrontal cortex contributes to processes involved in spatial working memory. The patient was also tested on a range of oculomotor paradigms, some of which required the temporary suppression of a saccadic response. He was unable to suppress making contra- or ipsilesional reflexive glances to peripheral stimuli on the anti-saccade paradigm, but his performance improved on delayed saccade, memory-guided saccade and fixation tasks. Although reflexive glances were observed under these conditions they occurred more frequently in response to contralesional stimuli than ipsilesional ones. Furthermore, the patient had no difficulty in performing anti-point movements with his ipsilesional hand. Thus, his inability to suppress reflexive glances on the anti-saccade task is not due to a generalised problem of distractibility. The patients deficits are discussed in terms of models of anti-saccade generation and are related to recent findings regarding the role of prefrontal cortex in working memory and visual attention."

This chapter describes the influence of parafoveal words on foveal inspection time. It examines the way foveal and parafoveal information combine and interact to determine the timing of eye movements on successive words in text. A crucial question,when fixating a particular word, what information is available from words not yet fixated, is asked and answered. By manipulating the difficulty of the foveal word in different experiments, either by changing word frequency or local syntactic load, it was observed that word frequency or syntactic difficulty manipulations produced similar results. The linguistic properties of the word, or words, being processed, determine from moment to moment the “when and where” of eye movement control. The dynamics of eye movement control in reading are complex and present a major source of variability in measured processing time. The analysis of eye movement measures derived from the unconstrained inspection of text is particularly problematic when trying to interpret experimentally induced variation in fixation duration or saccade extent. Short fixation duration on a word's initial letters reflects, successful prior parafoveal processing. In contrast, short fixation duration on a word's final letters reflects unsuccessful parafoveal processing of the succeeding word."

Performance measures are often focused on results; however, especially for a training purpose – at least in a nuclear industry, more detailed descriptions about processes are required. Situation awareness (SA) measurements have directly/indirectly played as a complimentary measure and provided descriptive insights on how to improve performance of operators for the next training. Unfortunately, most of the well-developed SA measurement techniques, such as Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) need an expert opinion which sometimes troubles easy spread of measurement’s application or usage. A quantitative SA measurement tool named Computational Representation of Situation Awareness with Graphical Expressions (CoRSAGE) is introduced to resolve some of these concerns. CoRSAGE is based on production rules to represent a human operator’s cognitive process of problem solving, and Bayesian inference to quantify it. Petri Net concept is also used for graphical expressions of SA flow. Three components – inference transition, volatile/non-volatile memory tokens – were newly developed to achieve required functions. Training data of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) scenario for an emergency condition and an earthquake scenario for an abnormal condition by real plant operators were used to validate the tool. The validation result showed that CoRSAGE performed a reasonable match to other performance results."

The chapter discusses the inspection time in relation to theoretical developments bearing upon attempts to measure rate of perceptual processing and within the context of a perceptual discrimination theory that incorporates the temporal accumulation of evidence as a basic information-processing operation. The relevance of this construct to the study of retarded functioning is outlined. The chapter describes different methods for estimating inspection time, but principally describes a backward masking procedure, which limits the duration of sensory information processing. Under this procedure, an estimate (λ) is defined operationally as the minimum exposure duration at which discrimination in an easy task is virtually error-free. The chapter reviews several studies comparing λ for mildly retarded and nonretarded persons, which have invariably demonstrated a marked deficiency among retarded adults, equivalent to a lag in mental age (MA) of at least 4 years. Experiments suggest that, particularly among retarded persons, functioning reflecting preliminary orientation is improved by practice. However, postregistration processing among retarded persons is more resistant to influence, as indicated by unsuccessful attempts to improve performance by practice and the modification of response requirements."

Much of this research has focused on the distributional properties of words, the units they consist of (morphemes, phonemes), and the syntactic structures they appear in (verb-categorization frames, syntactic constructions). In a series of studies we show that comprehenders are also sensitive to the frequencies of compositional four-word phrases (e.g. don’t have to worry): more frequent phrases are processed faster. The effect is not reducible to the frequency of the individual words or substrings and is observed across the entire frequency range (for low, mid and high frequency phrases). Comprehenders seem to learn and store frequency information about multi-word phrases. These findings call for processing models that can capture and predict phrase-frequency effects and support accounts where linguistic knowledge consists of patterns of varying sizes and levels of abstraction."

abstract = "Five reaction time sentence verification experiments were conducted in order to (1) investigate the source of interference between reading and visual imagery, (2) identify the sensory properties of the representation that are common to both reading and visual imagination, and (3) determine whether reading interferes with visual imagery during initial sentence comprehension or during subsequent sentence verification. Experiment 1 demonstrated that a visual representation, common to both reading and visual images, was the source of the interference observed. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that reading interferes with the spatial-like characteristics of a visual image. And finally, Experiments 4 and 5 offered evidence that imagery is not used in the initial determination of sentence meaning (comprehension). Together, the research presented offers evidence that the fundamental structure of many images is visuospatial, and that a visuospatial representation plays an overt role in the verification of many sentences."

This chapter presents a new look at the continuing debates in psycholinguistics over what is special about figurative language use. Figurative language does not constitute a unified class of linguistic materials that are understood by special figurative processes. Nonetheless, the indeterminate nature of many aspects of figurative meaning, a fact that is not properly acknowledged in many psycholinguistic studies, raises important issues about the possible trade-off between minimizing cognitive effort and maximizing cognitive effects during figurative language processing. This trade-off can be empirically studied and form the basis for future psycholinguistic research on figurative language. One of the continuing difficulties with the psycholinguistics literature on figurative language understanding is that few scholars ever attempt to define the terms literal and figurative. A traditional assumption in many academic disciplines is that literal meaning is primary and the product of default language comprehension. Thus, in psycholinguistic terms, the human language processor is designed for the analysis of literal meanings. Nonliteral, indirect, and figurative meanings are secondary products, and dependent on some prior analysis of what words and expressions literally mean. This general theory implies that nonliteral meanings should always take more time to interpret than are literal meanings."

Six experiments examined the similarity of word senses using categorization and inference tasks. The experiments found that subjects did not categorize together phrases that used a polysemous word in different senses, though they did when the word was used in the same sense. Different senses of a word were categorized together no more than 20% of the time, only slightly more often than different meanings of homonyms. Pre-exposing subjects to a polysemous relation did not increase categorization of word senses that had that relation. Finally, induction from one sense of a word to a different sense was also weak. The results are consistent with the view that polysemous senses are represented separately, often with little semantic overlap, helping to explain previous results that using a word in one sense interferes with using it in another sense, even if the senses are related. Implications for lexical representations are discussed."

This chapter presents a discussion on the word recognition literature. Word recognition research is central to notions regarding different levels/codes of analysis in language processing, attention, and memory. The lexical unit is ideally suited for such work because words can be analyzed at many different levels—for example, features, letters, graphemes, phonemes, morphemes, and semantics. Word recognition research is also central in the development of theories of automatic and attentional processes. Part of the reason for this emphasis is the natural relation between the development of reading skills and the development of automaticity. One can see the extra impetus from education circles regarding the development of word recognition skills. Moreover, the notion that the aspect of word recognition has been automatized and is no longer under the conscious control of the reader has historically provided some of the major fuel for arguments regarding self-encapsulated linguistic processing modules. The issue of how attentional control signals might modulate processes involved in word recognition has received renewed interest recently, and hence, notions of automaticity and modularity have been reevaluated."

abstract = "Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support."

Instead, prepotent sexual features (exposed and sexually aroused genitals), ubiquitous in audiovisual sexual stimuli, may elicit automatic genital responses, thereby leading to a nonspecific sexual arousal pattern in women. To examine the role of stimulus potency in women's sexual response, we assessed heterosexual women's and men's genital and subjective sexual arousal to slideshows of prepotent stimuli (erect penises and aroused vulvas), non-prepotent stimuli (flaccid penises and female pubic triangles), and sexually neutral stimuli. Contrary to our hypotheses, both women and men demonstrated gender-specific genital and subjective sexual arousal, such that sexual arousal was greatest to prepotent male and female stimuli, respectively. This is the first study to demonstrate gender-specific genital responding in heterosexual women."

This assumption has been challenged by the ‘Semantic Illusion Effect’ found in studies using Event Related brain Potentials. Semantically anomalous sentences did not produce the expected increase in N400 amplitude but rather one in P600 amplitude. To explain these findings, complex models have been devised in which an independent semantic processing stream can arrive at a sentence interpretation that may differ from the interpretation prescribed by the syntactic structure of the sentence. We review five such multi-stream models and argue that they do not account for the full range of relevant results because they assume that the amplitude of the N400 indexes some form of semantic integration. Based on recent evidence we argue that N400 amplitude might reflect the retrieval of lexical information from memory. On this view, the absence of an N400-effect in Semantic Illusion sentences can be explained in terms of priming. Furthermore, we suggest that semantic integration, which has previously been linked to the N400 component, might be reflected in the P600 instead. When combined, these functional interpretations result in a single-stream account of language processing that can explain all of the Semantic Illusion data."

Most notably, comprehension necessitates the application of prior knowledge in combination with the encoding of information currently in discourse focus. Comprehension requires building connections between those events and existing representations in memory. For example, the situations described in the first two riddles take place in chronological order and are temporally contiguous. The elephant was put in the refrigerator first; unless the elephant is removed, the giraffe cannot be stored in the fridge. To answer the riddle, the reader must connect these two situations. Comprehenders routinely assume that consecutively described events take place in the order in which they are described, and that no unmentioned event will have occurred between them. Thus, the two events should be connected with each other and, given expectations about chronological order; those events should be assigned a predictable temporal association. In fact, a growing body of evidence suggests that comprehenders routinely and/or strategically keep track of protagonists, objects, locations, and events to build useful associations."

abstract = "The sustained attention to response task (SART) has been the primary method of studying the phenomenon of mind wandering. We develop and experimentally test the first integrated cognitive process model that quantitatively explains all stationary features of behavioral performance in the SART. The model assumes that performance is generated by a competitive race between a stimulus-related decision process and a stimulus-unrelated rhythmic response process. We propose that the stimulus-unrelated process entrains to timing regularities in the task environment, and is unconditionally triggered as a habit or ‘insurance policy’ to protect against the deleterious effects of mind wandering on ongoing task performance. For two SART experiments the model provided a quantitatively precise account of a range of previously reported trends in choice, response time and self-reported mind wandering data. It also accounted for three previously unidentified features of response time distributions that place critical constraints on cognitive models of performance in situations when people might engage in task-unrelated thoughts. Furthermore, the parameters of the rhythmic race model were meaningfully associated with participants’ self-reported distraction, even though the model was never informed by these data. In a validation test, we disrupted the latent rhythmic component with a manipulation of inter-trial-interval variability, and showed that the architecture of the model provided insight into its counter-intuitive effect. We conclude that performance in the presence of mind wandering can be conceived as a competitive latent decision vs. rhythmic response process. We discuss how the rhythmic race model is not restricted to the study of distraction or mind wandering; it is applicable to any domain requiring repetitive responding where evidence accumulation is assumed to be an underlying principle of behavior."
