abstract = "Summary
Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle are thought to play a central role in premenstrual mood symptoms. In agreement, fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels affect brain processes in regions involved in emotion regulation. Recent findings, however, implicate psychological stress as a potential mediating factor and thus, we investigated whether effects of moderate psychological stress on relevant brain regions interact with menstrual cycle phase. Twenty-eight healthy women were tested in a crossover design with menstrual cycle phase (late luteal versus late follicular) and stress (stress induction versus control) as within-subject factors. After stress induction (or control), we probed neural responses to facial expressions using fMRI. During the late luteal phase, negative affect was highest and the stress-induced increase in heart rate was mildly augmented. fMRI data of the control condition replicate previous findings of elevated amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses when comparing the late luteal with the late follicular phase. Importantly, stress induction had opposite effects in the two cycle phases, with unexpected lower response magnitudes in the late luteal phase. Moreover, the larger the increase in allopregnanolone concentration across the menstrual cycle was, the smaller the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses were after stress induction in the late luteal phase. Our findings show that moderate psychological stress influences menstrual cycle effects on activity in the emotion regulation circuitry. These results provide potential insights into how fluctuations in allopregnanolone that naturally occur during the menstrual cycle may change stress vulnerability."

However, research on aging and emotion has consistently found that older adults experience more positive and fewer negative emotions than do younger adults, despite the age-related declines and losses. Older adults seem better at emotion regulation than do their younger counterparts. The current chapter attempts to explain such age-related differences in emotional experience and regulation through the lens of several social and emotional theories of aging. We introduce the theories within the framework of the process model of emotion regulation that proposes five emotion regulation processes, including (1) selection of the situation, (2) modification of the situation, (3) deployment of attention, (4) change of cognition, and (5) modulation of experiential, behavioral, or physiological responses. We also discuss how these theories can be applied to understand research findings in the area of aging and work."

In addition to this methodological contribution the study makes a subject contribution by illuminating the impact of emerging technologies on creativity, and re-imagining design within a co-creation workspace. We explore the interplay between creative and business processes, often caricatured stereotypically as the ‘creatives’ versus the ‘suits’, and ‘magic’ versus ‘logic’. We use data captured during a collaborative case study between a highly-innovative design company and business researchers. The case focused on a designer as she completed a design brief for a simulated new product. The study surfaced areas of disconnect between the creative aspects and the drive for business efficiency in the design process. Two key areas; interaction between variables and concept transference were identified. The discussion considers issues related to how design might transform into a co-creative activity conducted in a technology-enhanced workspace where the distinctions between creative design and business processes are all but eradicated."

Symptoms of ASD likely emerge from a complex interaction between pre-existing neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities and the child's environment, modified by compensatory skills and protective factors. Prospective studies of infants at high familial risk for ASD (who have an older sibling with a diagnosis) are beginning to characterize these developmental pathways to the emergence of clinical symptoms. Here, we review the range of behavioral and neurocognitive markers for later ASD that have been identified in high-risk infants in the first years of life. We discuss theoretical implications of emerging patterns, and identify key directions for future work, including potential resolutions to several methodological challenges for the field. Mapping how ASD unfolds from birth is critical to our understanding of the developmental mechanisms underlying this disorder. A more nuanced understanding of developmental pathways to ASD will help us not only to identify children who need early intervention, but also to improve the range of interventions available to them."

Fifty-five university students were administered 14 selected items of the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices test. Results showed that individuals differed in terms of speed, but also in terms of differences in strategies. More specifically, higher and lower ability subjects differed in terms of their patterns of item and matrix inspections, and several strategic indices (proportional time on matrix, number of alternations between matrix and response choice, latency to first alternation, matrix time distribution) emerged in regression analyses as significant predictors of Raven performance. Given the high reliabilities associated with these strategic indices, it is argued that these results provide evidence against a strong basic-information-processing view and supports a multifaceted view of individual differences in intelligence that includes differences in strategies."

Although privileged objects interfered with reference to an identical object in common ground, addressees were always more likely to look at an object in common ground than privileged ground. Experiment 2 used definite and indefinite referring expressions with early or late points of disambiguation, depending on the uniqueness of the display objects. The speaker’s and addressee’s perspectives matched when the speaker was accurately informed about the display, and mismatched when the speaker was misinformed. When perspectives matched, addressees identified the target faster with early than with late disambiguation displays. When perspectives mismatched, addressees still identified the target quickly, showing an ability to use the speaker’s perspective. These experiments demonstrate that although addressees cannot completely ignore information in privileged ground, common ground and perspective each have immediate effects on reference resolution."

However, to date, the field lacks a cohesive description of available VR technologies, especially in the marketing domain, and needs a framework for effective VR based on consumer product involvement. Therefore, we first outline a typology of VR by level of product involvement, delineating how brands might implement VR. Second, after a comprehensive literature review, we propose a dual model of product involvement for VR strategies. High product involvement strategies directly influence consumer responses through imagination, co-creation, and telepresence. Meanwhile, low-involvement strategies increase brand engagement and indirectly influence consumer responses through the less cognitively taxing process of interactivity. This work includes nine propositions for effective strategies in each route and offers several implications for theory and practice."

Then a central mechanism is highlighted how working memory is involved in the control of attention in sports by reviewing research demonstrating that the activated contents in working memory control the focus of attention. The second part of the paper reviews literature showing that working memory capacity is an important individual difference variable that is predictive of controlling attention in a goal-directed manner and avoiding distraction and interference in sports. Finally, we address the question whether differences in working memory capacity contribute to sport expertise."

abstract = "Nuclear power plant (NPP) outages are challenging construction projects. Delays in NPP outage processes can cause significant economic losses. In typical NPP outages, extremely busy outage schedules, large crew sizes, dynamic workspaces and zero tolerance of accidents pose challenges to ensuring the resilience of outage control, which should rapidly and proactively respond to delays, errors, or unexpected tasks added during outages. Two mutually interacting practical problems impede NPPs from achieving such resilient outage control: 1) how to control errors and wastes effectively during the “handoffs” between tasks, and 2) how to respond to numerous contingencies in NPP outage workflows in a responsive and proactive manner. A resilient NPP outage control system should address these two practical problems through “Human-Centered Automation (HCA),” which is improving the control process automation while fully considering human factors. Previous studies examined two categories of technologies that potentially enable HCA in outage control: 1) computational modeling and simulation methods for predicting states of field operations and workflows; 2) data collection and processing methods for capturing the reality and thus providing feedback to computational models. Unfortunately, limited studies systematically synthesize technological challenges related to these practical problems and underlying HCA principles. This paper identifies the domain requirements, challenges, and potential solutions of achieving the HCA system that effectively supports resilient NPP outage control. This proposed system aims at significantly improving the performance of handoff monitoring/control and responding to contingencies during the outage. Firstly, the authors identified information acquisition and modeling challenges of achieving human-center automation for outage control. The rest of the paper then synthesizes potential techniques available in the domains of computer science, cognitive science, system science, and construction engineering that can potentially address these challenges. The authors concluded this literature and technological review with a research roadmap for achieving HCA in construction."

This paper presents a pilot study applying a simple vigilance task to simulate the monitoring condition during a partially automated driving session. We gained insights on how drivers voluntarily schedule secondary task processing according to the current and anticipatory monitoring demand on a structured three-level manna. Results indicated that participants’ anticipation of a higher hazard event rate or a higher urgency level could promote more attention to monitoring the hazard. Furthermore, when the expectation of an upcoming hazard increased, participants allocated more attention to discharge the surveillance role. Finally, a descriptive test-engage-wait-exit model indicated that participants tended to disengage from the secondary task with the anticipation of a more urgent hazard but to continue the secondary task with frequent switching-back for a less urgent hazard."

Two studies assessed implicit (Study 1) and explicit (Study 2) attitudes toward stuttering and those who stutter among speech-language pathologists (SLPs).
Method
In Study 1, 15 SLPs completed the Stuttering Implicit Association Test, a measure of implicit attitudes toward stuttered speech. In Study 2, 40 SLPs provided explicit attitudes about individuals who stutter, assessed via self-report ratings of an adult who stutters and one who does not. Participants also completed measures of experience with stuttering.
Results
As a group, clinicians displayed negative implicit attitudes toward stuttering. Explicit attitudes toward a person who stutters were positive, albeit less positive than attitudes toward a person who does not stutter. Amount of prior exposure to stuttering among these experienced SLPs was not significantly associated with either implicit or explicit attitudes.
Conclusions
These findings highlight the importance of evaluating both implicit and explicit attitudes toward stuttering. The finding of positive explicit attitudes but negative implicit attitudes among similar samples of SLPs underscores the need to study implicit attitudes toward stuttering. Considering only explicit attitudes could lead to incomplete conclusions about the complex nature of attitudes toward stuttering."

Hence, attentional processing of sexual cues is expected to not only bias attention but to also distract from other cognitive (foreground) tasks. It is, however, unclear to what extent these stimuli capture attention and whether there are differences between men and women. This meta-analysis combined the results of 32 studies employing experiments of attentional bias toward and distraction by sexual stimuli. From these, 13 studies provided data to examine gender differences. Overall, attentional bias and distractibility was lower than anticipated (gz = 0.43, p < .001) and there was support for the assumption of higher attention bias/interference in men (gs = 0.29, p = .031). Importantly, there was evidence for the presence of publication bias.

While codeswitchers demonstrated N400 sensitivity to congruency manipulations, non-codeswitchers showed a modulation of early frontal EEG activity to switching, regardless of switch type. Experiment 2 validated the translation-equivalent target words compared in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, the bilinguals who participated in Experiment 1 completed a task that elicited naturally-produced codeswitched speech. Codeswitchers switched more often than non-codeswitchers, and their switches robustly reflected the conditions that were more easily processed in Experiment 1. Together, the results indicate the comprehension system becomes optimally attuned to variation in the input, and demonstrate that switching costs depend on the type of codeswitch and bilinguals’ language experience."

Fifty-two Korean undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either simple or complex condition and read two TOEFL passages while answering multiple-choice reading comprehension questions. Unlike simple versions that included coherent texts, complex versions contained texts whose paragraphs were disarranged and additionally required participants to order them coherently. A forward digit span test and a nonword repetition test were used to measure the participants’ phonological short-term memory, and a backward digit span test and an operation span test were employed to assess their complex working memory. The results revealed that task complexity did not affect reading comprehension scores, although participants perceived the complex tasks significantly more demanding. Also, under the complex condition, participants benefited from higher nonword span scores when answering reading comprehension questions."

Although behavioral health risks are routinely highlighted among the most serious threats to crew safety, understanding of specific emotional responses most likely to occur and interfere with mission success has lagged in comparison to other risk domains. Even within the domain of behavioral health, emotional constructs remain to be ‘unpacked’ to the same extent as other factors such as attention and fatigue. The current paper provides a review of previous studies that have examined emotional responses in isolated, confined, extreme environments (ICE) toward informing a needed research agenda. We include research conducted during space flight, long-duration space simulation analogs, and polar environments and utilize a well-established model of emotion and emotion regulation to conceptualize specific findings. Lastly, we propose four specific directions for future research: (1) use of a guiding theoretical framework for evaluating emotion responses in ICE environments; (2) leveraging multi-method approaches to improve the reliability of subjective reports of emotional health; (3) a priori selection of precise emotional constructs to guide measure selection; and (4) focusing on positive in addition to negative emotion in order to provide a more complete understanding of individual risk and resilience."

The primary purpose of the current study was to explore differences in navigational choices and recovery from unsuccessful actions of learners with high and low levels of sustained attention. Undergraduate students searched the Internet for information corresponding to an assigned low domain knowledge topic for 20min while their eye-gaze was recorded. High- and low-attending learners differed in the selection of links, level of linearity used to navigate the Internet, Web reading strategies, and frequency of deploying unsuccessful actions. These results indicate that sustained attention may be impacted by the monitoring of one’s progress towards the learning goal, and have implications for scaffolding provided by teachers and adaptive hypermedia systems."

To better understand its temporal properties, we presented the CFS masks at 9 frequencies, and examined their influence on stimuli visibility, while taking into account the inter-individual variability and the change of CFS suppression as the experiment progressed. The frequencies consisted of fundamental frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz, and their 2nd and 3rd harmonics, which included the 10 Hz frequency typically used in most of the CFS studies. We found that the suppression of stimulus awareness was stronger under 4, 6 and 8 Hz than 10 Hz. After controlling for inter-individual variability with mixed-effects analysis, we found that the number of seen trials was lower for the 4 Hz-basis frequencies than the 5 Hz ones, and was lower for the 2nd than 3rd harmonic. We propose that this may be caused by an interaction between the CFS masks and the ongoing sampling of the attentional mechanism. Examining individual data, we also found a habituation effect that the participants saw significantly more stimuli as the experiment progressed. Our results suggest that these factors need to be taken care of in future CFS studies in order to achieve optimal visual awareness suppression and ensure the generalizability of results."

However, theory posits that sustained activation of these stress circuits after the stressful event may play an equally important role in the development of stress-related psychopathology. Importantly, such post-stress network changes remain poorly characterized. The amygdala with its connections is crucially positioned in the central stress circuitry that mediates the initial stress response. Hence, we investigated post-stress amygdala-centered connectivity patterns in order to characterize the aftermath of acute, experimentally-induced stress in healthy humans. We recorded resting-state functional MRI in 26 female participants following a period of moderate psychological stress induced by means of aversive (vs. emotionally neutral) movie watching with a self-referencing instruction. Next, we implemented a seedregion analysis calculating the voxel-wise correlation with the anatomically extracted time-series of the amygdala. Various stress measures confirmed successful stress induction. Moreover, we demonstrated enhanced functional coupling of the amygdala with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and a dorso-rostral pontine region, which appears to overlap with the anatomical location of the locus coeruleus (LC), when contrasting the stress with the control group. Thus, we show that the aftermath of acute stress is qualified by prolonged activation in an amygdala-connectivity network. This pattern of co-activation may indicate an extended state of hypervigilance that promotes sustained salience and mnemonic processing after stress. Characterization of the post-stress brain state may provide initial insight into the early phases of psychological trauma formation."

However, there have been few systematic investigations of individual differences. Such an investigation could help refine models of word recognition by indicating which processing parameters are likely to vary, and could also have important implications for work on language impairment. The present study begins to fill this gap by relating individual differences in overall language ability to variation in online word recognition processes. Using the visual world paradigm, we evaluated online spoken word recognition in adolescents who varied in both basic language abilities and non-verbal cognitive abilities. Eye movements to target, cohort and rhyme objects were monitored during spoken word recognition, as an index of lexical activation. Adolescents with poor language skills showed fewer looks to the target and more fixations to the cohort and rhyme competitors. These results were compared to a number of variants of the TRACE model (McClelland & Elman, 1986) that were constructed to test a range of theoretical approaches to language impairment: impairments at sensory and phonological levels; vocabulary size, and generalized slowing. None of the existing approaches were strongly supported, and variation in lexical decay offered the best fit. Thus, basic word recognition processes like lexical decay may offer a new way to characterize processing differences in language impairment."

In the critical sentences (e.g., The meal was devouring…), the syntactic cues unambiguously signaled an Agent interpretation of the subject noun, whereas the semantic cues supported a Theme interpretation. An Agent interpretation would render the main verb semantically anomalous (as meals do not devour things). Conversely, the Theme interpretation would render the main verb syntactically anomalous (as the -ED form, not the -ING form, is syntactically appropriate for this interpretation). We report that the main verbs in such sentences elicit the P600 effect associated with syntactic anomalies, rather than the N400 effect associated with semantic anomalies. We conclude that, at least under certain conditions, semantic information is “in control” of how words are combined during sentence processing."

We tested the effects of images on message engagement (i.e., attitudes, knowledge, and behavioural-intention) via depth of processing and whether strength of environmental identity moderated these effects. As predicted, for people with lower levels of environmental identity, the disgust image conditions led to lower overall engagement with the message content indirectly via lower depth of processing, compared to a no image control condition (Study 1 and Study 2) or a sad image (Study 2). Contrary to what was predicted, the effect of the sad image condition did not increase depth of processing relative to the control condition (Study 2). The key finding suggests that disgusting images should be avoided in pro-environmental communication."

While research has revealed how specific facial channels such as emotional expression are processed, little is known about the prioritization and integration of multiple cues in the face during dyadic exchanges. Classic models of face perception have emphasized the segregation of dynamic vs. static facial features along independent information processing pathways. Here we review recent behavioral and neuroscientific evidence suggesting that within the dynamic stream, concurrent changes in eye gaze and emotional expression can yield early independent effects on face judgments and covert shifts of visuospatial attention. These effects are partially segregated within initial visual afferent processing volleys, but are subsequently integrated in limbic regions such as the amygdala or via reentrant visual processing volleys. This spatiotemporal pattern may help to resolve otherwise perplexing discrepancies across behavioral studies of emotional influences on gaze-directed attentional cueing. Theoretical explanations of gaze-expression interactions are discussed, with special consideration of speed-of-processing (discriminability) and contextual (ambiguity) accounts. Future research in this area promises to reveal the mental chronometry of face processing and interpersonal attention, with implications for understanding how social referencing develops in infancy and is impaired in autism and other disorders of social cognition."

We clarify ambiguities around the meaning of WFC, overcome questionable research assumptions, make testable counter-normative predictions, reconcile “levels” and “episodes” WFC conceptions, and explain how WFC can even have a net positive effect for the person. In the model, a trigger event causes a perceived WF role incompatibility and a negative change in core affect, prompting either a scripted response or controlled sensemaking. In the latter, cognitive appraisals and secondary affect ensue, causing a choice of a coping/resolution response. Responses are reinforced/punished, and possibly, consciously evaluated. Episodes end with the potential storage of outputs in long-term memory. State inputs to an episode condition processing and memory storage. Stored episode outputs can thereafter become inputs to future episodes and/or cause longer-term change in role performance, satisfaction, and well-being. After describing these processes, we suggest new directions for WFC research and practice."

We show that using unidirectional RNN with time shifting achieves higher performance compared to a bidirectional RNN, which is a suitable choice in this kind of problem where the feature pattern is not yet observed for the initial frames.

This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from fine-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identified six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based SRL strategies and identified three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with specific course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners. Challenges that arise in the process of extracting theory-based patterns from observed behaviour are discussed, including analytic issues and limitations of available trace data from learning platforms."

Matching was faster when the matching probe letter was in the LVF than when it was in the RVF. Importantly, the pattern of results was the same for extra-foveal and foveal presentations, supporting the theory that the representation of the fovea is split down the middle into two visual fields rather then being bilateral.

Detailed explanation resulted in lower extraneous cognitive load but higher germane cognitive load and learning motivation than cue; constructed-response items resulted in lower intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load but higher germane cognitive load than multiple-choice items.

Method: We have conducted a family of four controlled experiments. We involved groups of bachelor and master students. Results: Results suggest that the use of object diagrams does not always introduce significant benefits in terms of design comprehensibility. We found that benefits strongly depend on the experience of participants and their familiarity with UML. More experienced participants achieved better design comprehensibility when provided with both class and object diagrams, while less experienced seemed to be damaged when using class and object diagrams together. Results also showed the absence of substantial variations in the time needed to comprehend UML models, with or without object diagrams. Implications: Our results suggest that it is important to be aware and take into account experience and UML familiarity before using object diagrams in software modeling."

However, current models of loneliness remain vague on how this cognitive bias is expressed in lonely individuals. The current review provides an up-to-date overview of studies examining loneliness in relation to various aspects of cognitive functioning. These studies are interpreted in light of the Social Information Processing (SIP) model. A wide range of studies indicate that lonely individuals have a negative cognitive bias in all stages of SIP. More specifically, lonely individuals have an increased attention for social threatening stimuli, hold negative and hostile intent attributions, expect rejection, evaluate themselves and others negatively, endorse less promotion- and more prevention-oriented goals, and have a low self-efficacy. This negative cognitive bias seems specific to the social context. Avenues for future research and implications for clinical practice are discussed."

abstract = "Background
Message avoidance (e.g., trying not to look at the message) may be motivated by reactance, a maladaptive rejection of the message. An alternative view is that avoidance indicates that a message is eliciting fear and other negative affect, thereby increasing the likelihood of behavioral change. We sought to identify which psychological mechanism—reactance or fear and other negative affect—explains message avoidance. We also examined whether avoidance was associated with more forgoing or butting out of cigarettes.
Method
Trial 1 randomly assigned 2149 adult U.S. smokers to receive either pictorial warnings (intervention) or text-only warnings (control) on their cigarette packs for four weeks in 2014 and 2015. Trial 2 randomly assigned 719 adult U.S. smokers to receive either messages about toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke (intervention) or messages about not littering cigarette butts (control) for three weeks in 2016 and 2017. Negative affect included fear, anxiety, disgust, sadness, and guilt. Reactance included perceived threat to freedom, anger, and counterarguing.
Results
Intervention messages led to greater message avoidance in both trials (both p < .001). In Trial 1, intervention messages elicited greater negative affect, which in turn was associated with greater avoidance (mediated effect = 0.21, p < .001). In contrast, reactance explained only a small part of the effect in Trial 1 (mediated effect = 0.03, p < .001). Similarly, in Trial 2, intervention messages elicited greater negative affect, which was associated with more avoidance (mediated effect = 0.12, p < .001); reactance did not explain any of the effect. In both trials, avoidance was associated with more forgoing or butting out of cigarettes (ps < .001).
Conclusions
Smokers may avoid cigarette pack risk messages because they evoke aversive types of emotion. These studies add to a growing body of evidence that, in the context of cigarette pack messages, avoidance is not a form of defensive processing but instead a sign of deeper processing."

The combination of brand posts with visuals and text-based messages gives brand publics something to talk about and ultimately can lead to stronger relationships."

Specifically, we examined performance-based measures of affect labeling of one's own emotions, emotional granularity and dialecticism. Healthy participants (N = 108) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale–20 Item Questionnaire. Participants viewed a series of film clips standardized to elicit discrete emotional states. After each clip, they indicated the emotion they experienced “the most” and rated a list of non-primary emotions, which formed indices of emotional granularity and dialecticism. Alexithymia was associated with increased tendency to report experiencing “no emotion” following evocative film clips, reduced negative emotional granularity and dialecticism of experienced emotions. TAS-20 subscales were each associated with a unique set of emotional correlates. In a healthy population, alexithymia is associated with reduced awareness of emotional states, and reduced dialecticism and granularity of negative (but not positive) emotions. Our performance-based assessment enriches understanding of the mechanisms underlying alexithymia by underscoring the central importance of emotion awareness, negative emotional granularity and dialecticism."

The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UES’ development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and offer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies."

This attentional bias for drug cues is thought to lead to increased craving and drug use, and may draw individuals into a vicious cycle of drug addiction. In the current study we developed a Dutch version of the cannabis Stroop task and measured attentional bias for cannabis words in a group of heavy cannabis users and matched controls. The classical Stroop task was used as a global measure of cognitive control and we examined the relationship between cognitive control, cannabis-related problems, cannabis craving and cannabis attentional bias. Using our version of the cannabis Stroop task, a group of heavy cannabis users showed attentional bias to cannabis words, whereas a control group of non-users did not. Furthermore, within the group of cannabis users, those who were clinically recognized as dependent showed a stronger attentional bias than the heavy, non-dependent users. Cannabis users who displayed reduced cognitive control (as measured with the classical Stroop task) showed increased session-induced craving. Contrary to expectations, however, cognitive control did not appear to modulate the relationship between attentional bias to cannabis words (cannabis Stroop task) and cannabis dependence. This study confirmed the relationship between cannabis dependence and attentional bias and extends this by highlighting a moderating role for cognitive control, which may make some more vulnerable to craving."

A 2 (required effort; high, low)×2 (support availability; available, not available) between-subjects design was used with one hundred and twenty participants randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Participants received instructions designed to manipulate perceptions of required effort and support availability before demand/resource evaluations and cardiovascular responses were assessed. Participants then performed the novel motor task (laparoscopic surgery) while performance was recorded. Participants in the low perceived required effort condition evaluated the task as more of a challenge (i.e., resources outweighed demands), exhibited a cardiovascular response more indicative of a challenge state (i.e., higher cardiac output and lower total peripheral resistance), and performed the task better (i.e., quicker completion time) than those in the high perceived required effort condition. However, perceptions of support availability had no significant impact on participants' demand/resource evaluations, cardiovascular responses, or performance. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between perceptions of required effort and support availability. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at promoting a challenge state should include instructions that help individuals perceive that the task is not difficult and requires little physical and mental effort to perform effectively."

We propose anxiety-related impairments in cognitive-behavioral performance are the consequences of enhanced stimulus-driven attention. Accordingly, reflexive, habitual behaviors that rely on stimulus-driven mechanisms should be facilitated in an anxious state, while novel, flexible behaviors that compete with the former should be impaired. To test these predictions, healthy adults (N=17) performed a mixed-saccade task, which pits habitual actions (pro-saccades) against atypical ones (anti-saccades), under anxiety-inducing threat of shock and safe conditions. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) captured oscillatory responses in the preparatory interval preceding target onset and saccade execution. Results showed threat-induced anxiety differentially impacted response times based on the type of saccade initiated, slowing anti-saccades but facilitating erroneous pro-saccades on anti-saccade trials. MEG source analyses revealed that successful suppression of reflexive pro-saccades and correct initiation of anti-saccades during threat was marked by increased theta power in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortical and midbrain regions (superior colliculi) implicated in stimulus-driven attention. Theta activity may delay stimulus-driven processes to enable generation of an anti-saccade. Moreover, compared to safety, threat reduced beta desynchronization in inferior parietal cortices during anti-saccade preparation but increased it during pro-saccade preparation. Differential effects in inferior parietal cortices indicate a greater readiness to execute anti-saccades during safety and to execute pro-saccades during threat. These findings suggest that, in an anxiety state, reduced cognitive-behavioral flexibility may stem from enhanced stimulus-driven attention, which may serve the adaptive function of optimizing threat detection."

Methods
Participants were 66 university students who completed an assessment including questions about AOD use, a visual search task to measure value-modulated attentional capture, and a goal-directed selective attention task as a measure of cognitive control.
Results
The association between the effect of value-modulated attentional capture and illicit drug use was moderated by level of cognitive control. Among participants with lower levels of cognitive control, value-modulated attentional capture was associated with illicit drug use. This was not the case among participants with higher levels of cognitive control, who instead showed a significant association between illicit drug use and self-reported impulsivity, as well as alcohol use.
Conclusions
These results provide support for models that view addictive behaviours as resulting from interaction and competition between automatic and more reflective processes. That is, the mechanisms that ultimately drive addictive behaviour may differ between people low or high in cognitive control. This has important implications for understanding the development and maintenance of substance use disorders and potentially their treatment and prevention."

This chapter presents a discussion on the syntax–semantics interface. The task of a theory of semantic interpretation is to characterize how elements in a syntactic string semantically relate to one another. Clearly, this depends on how one conceptualizes the meaning of the elementary building blocks—that is, the terminal nodes of a syntactic tree. Interpreting an expression typically requires integrating it into an evolving discourse model. Frequently, this requires resolving ambiguities at conceptually distinct levels, fixing reference, and drawing inferences to align local and global aspects of the discourse. To fully accomplish this task, it is uncontroversial that, in addition to lexical and syntactic constraints, comprehenders must draw upon pragmatic knowledge. The importance of high-level constraints has been illustrated by the finding that comprehenders sometimes adopt a pragmatically plausible interpretation even if it is incongruent with lexical and syntactic constraints."

The algorithm was tested by randomly introducing artificial blinks into eye movement data and computing the errors introduced by the patches. We also computed visual vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) gain and phase in healthy and vestibulopathic subjects during a locomotor task, before and after blink removal, to demonstrate the interpretive importance of eliminating blink artifacts. The error introduced by the patched data was small (0.50±0.32°) and within the resolution of head angle measurements. Comparison of gain and phase shift before and after removing blinks revealed that even when calculated values are within expected limits, coherence of the VVOR signal was significantly (p=0.003) lower prior to blink removal (0.51±0.37) compared to that after blink removal (0.92±0.08). Comparison of VVOR calculations between healthy and vestibulopathic subjects (after removal of blinks) revealed that vestibulopathic subjects had significantly decreased gains (p=0.018) and increased phase shifts (p=0.009): these results agree with data reported in literature. We conclude that the Kalman filter detection and cubic spline patching algorithms are useful tools for VOG and should enable reliable VVOR measurements during unconstrained, ecologically meaningful locomotor activities."

Advertisements are an important part of the visual world. From the perspective of clients who order advertisements, advertisements are supposed to be effective. In several experiments discussed in the chapter, eye movements were measured during the viewing of advertisements containing a large pictorial element, a headline, and a fictitious product name. Items targeting identical products were designed in the explicit and implicit versions. Participants were asked to view the stimuli item-by-item in preparation for an evaluation on scales of valence and interestingness or for a short paraphrasing of ad content. Viewers spent significantly more time on implicit advertisements and also rated them as more positive and interesting. While mean fixation durations and saccade amplitudes did not differ, there was a substantial difference in the number of fixations. The variation of task had profound consequences both for viewing behavior on regions of interest (headline, picture, and brand name) and recall but did not affect the main effect of ad complexity."

abstract = "With this contribution to the discussion about mental models we present a cognitive model for the understanding of speech and vision sensor data. The main point of this article is to explain the interaction between visual perception and language. The integration of language and vision is based on a theory of mental models in terms of which the integrative and coherent representation of objects, situations and events is crucial. The process of understanding does not only take place between adjacent processing levels, but interaction between visual components and language components on various processing levels is also important. Both aspects are crucial for cognitive modelling: The process of integrating sensor data into mental representations and the integration of various modalities. As far as the experimental-simulative method in the area of cognitive science is concerned we are working on a simulation system. The basis of this system is a semantic network formalism which enables us to produce a uniform representation of different types of knowledge and a direct connection of a mental representation with sensor near levels. This system is being developed within the framework of a long term project called Collaborative Research Centre “Situated Artificial Communicators” (SFB 360) at Bielefeld University, Germany.11This research is funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant SFB 360 - C3."

abstract = "Scams and other malicious attempts to influence people are continuing to proliferate across the globe, aided by the availability of technology that makes it increasingly easy to create communications that appear to come from legitimate sources. The rise in integrated technologies and the connected nature of social communications means that online scams represent a growing issue across society, with scammers successfully persuading people to click on malicious links, make fraudulent payments, or download malicious attachments. However, current understanding of what makes people particularly susceptible to scams in online contexts, and therefore how we can effectively reduce potential vulnerabilities, is relatively poor. So why are online scams so effective? And what makes people particularly susceptible to them? This paper presents a theoretical review of literature relating to individual differences and contextual factors that may impact susceptibility to such forms of malicious influence in online contexts. A holistic approach is then proposed that provides a theoretical foundation for research in this area, focusing on the interaction between the individual, their current context, and the influence message itself, when considering likely response behaviour."

In this study, we examined the effects of visual and non-visual distractions during driving, using a high-fidelity driving simulator. The visual task was presented either at an offset angle on an in-vehicle screen, or on the back of a moving lead vehicle. Similar to results from previous studies in this area, non-visual (cognitive) distraction resulted in improved lane keeping performance and increased gaze concentration towards the centre of the road, compared to baseline driving, and further examination of the steering control metrics indicated an increase in steering wheel reversal rates, steering wheel acceleration, and steering entropy. We show, for the first time, that when the visual task is presented centrally, drivers’ lane deviation reduces (similar to non-visual distraction), whilst measures of steering control, overall, indicated more steering activity, compared to baseline. When using a visual task that required the diversion of gaze to an in-vehicle display, but without a manual element, lane keeping performance was similar to baseline driving. Steering wheel reversal rates were found to adequately tease apart the effects of non-visual distraction (increase of 0.5° reversals) and visual distraction with offset gaze direction (increase of 2.5° reversals). These findings are discussed in terms of steering control during different types of in-vehicle distraction, and the possible role of manual interference by distracting secondary tasks."

Evolution in medical advancements is on a par with that observed in the disease-causing agents and viruses. Starting from a medical era during which invasive surgeries were performed without anesthesia, the need for painless, safe, hygienic, and successful surgeries has led to the modern era of surgery, which has a relatively small mortality rate. The practical use of minimally invasive approaches that result in fewer wound-related complications, quick organ function return, and shorter hospitalizations has led to higher acceptance of image-guided surgical procedures. In our proposed system, we present an IoT-based surgical model that involves a virtual reality-based (VR-based) user interface, predictive analytics that predict the “what-ifs” for an activity to be performed during the surgery based on the data collected during similar previous surgeries, and artificial intelligence that learns from the same dataset used by predictive analytics to assist surgeons during the surgery. Virtual reality refers to an environment artificially created by the support of computer software. When humans access such an environment, they believe that they are actually there in the artificially created environment. Headsets and other navigators can be used along with the VR set-up in order to provide a more immersive environment. The experience obtained through the power of VR is no less than the actual reality. For a more immersive experience, the Oculus Rift VR system is to be used as part of the proposed model. The VR system is to be connected to the SAP IoT interface of the SAP Cloud system. Predictive analytics is one of the latest software paradigms that enables analysis of large datasets and prediction of future outcomes and behavior. It involves building a predictive analytics model by using big data and IoT sensors to uncover hidden risks, explore unforeseen opportunities, and reach a better understanding. In our proposed model, SAP predictive analytics is to be deployed to build a surgical predictive model that could provide real-time predictions during surgery based on the data collected during previous surgeries. Artificial intelligence is a computing paradigm used to create systems that automate intelligent processes. AI can be used for learning, problem solving, and decision-making processes and can work with a speed and precision that humans are able to achieve only with great effort. AI is to be deployed in our proposed surgical model to minimize the surgeons’ efforts in navigating the noninvasive surgical equipment and the camera. Often there is a difference between the intention with which a surgeon navigates and the actual navigation which happens internally during the surgery. The surgeon has to put in more effort to overcome this mismatch. In order to address this issue, formulating AI in the surgical internal device navigation could result in reduced manual effort by the surgeon, which in turn would help him in concentrating on comparatively more important surgical thoughts and activities. The SAP Leonardo Machine Learning feature is to be deployed in the proposed model."

Meta-analyses now show that information-processing biases do characterize anxious individuals. More specifically, anxious individuals preferentially attend to threat-relevant information as well as interpreting ambiguous information as threatening. There is also some evidence that there is preferential memory for social information in socially anxious individuals. By far the majority of this research has examined the correlational nature of these cognitive biases and anxiety. However, since the second edition of this book, accumulating evidence suggests that such biases may play a causal role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorders. In previous editions, we introduced the concept of experimental approaches to modifying information-processing biases and presented preliminary evidence suggesting the utility of these interventions. Since the last edition of this chapter, the field has witnessed a surge of interest in the modification of cognitive biases in social anxiety. This research has largely focused on attentional bias modification, although research is beginning to accumulate examining the efficacy of interpretation bias modification in reducing social anxiety symptoms. Together these studies suggest that information-processing biases may be causally implicated in social anxiety. Relative to attention and interpretation, research on memory biases in social anxiety lags behind. In this chapter, we summarize the evidence for information-processing biases that may characterize socially anxious individuals. For each domain, we provide a review of the literature and suggest areas of future research."

Using a 2×3-experimental design, participants (N=123) were asked to learn about biology with multimedia instruction that manipulated modality (text vs. narration) and presence of seductive details (no-sds vs. textual-sds vs. narrated-sds). Results of variance analyses show a modality effect. In addition, moderated mediation analyses with the moderator modality and mediator situational interest confirm the affective mediation assumption with the following two conditional effects. A direct detrimental effect of seductive details on learning performance under the text-condition and an indirect compensatory effect under the narration-condition were shown."

Chronic stress is known to have negative effects on reproduction, but little is known about how it affects the sexual response cycle. The present study examined the relationship between chronic stress and sexual arousal and the mechanisms that mediate this relationship.
Aim
The aim of this study is to test the relationship between chronic stress and sexual arousal and identify mechanisms that may explain this relationship. We predicted that women experiencing high levels of chronic stress would show lower levels of genital arousal and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) and higher levels of cortisol and cognitive distraction compared with women with average levels of stress.
Methods
Women who were categorized as high in chronic stress (high stress group; n = 15) or average in chronic stress (average stress group; n = 15) provided saliva samples and watched an erotic film while having their genital and psychological arousal measured.
Main Outcome Measures
Main outcome measures were vaginal pulse amplitude, psychological arousal, salivary cortisol, salivary DHEAS, and heart rate and compared them between women with high and average levels of chronic stress.
Results
Women in the high stress group had lower levels of genital, but not psychological arousal, had higher levels of cortisol, and reported more distraction during the erotic film than women in the average stress group. The main predictor of decreased genital sexual arousal was participants’ distraction scores.
Conclusions
High levels of chronic stress were related to lower levels of genital sexual arousal. Both psychological (distraction) and hormonal (increased cortisol) factors were related to the lower levels of sexual arousal seen in women high in chronic stress, but distraction was the only significant predictor when controlling for other variables.

Thus, in the paper, we present a study of human–chatbot interaction, focusing on the affective responses of users to different types of interfaces with which they interact. The experiment consisted of two parts: measurement of psychophysiological reactions of chatbot users and a detailed questionnaire that focused on assessing interactions and willingness to collaborate with a bot. In the first quantitative stage, participants interacted with a chatbot, either with a simple text chatbot (control group) or an avatar reading its responses in addition to only presenting them on the screen (experimental group. We gathered the following psychophysiological data from participants: electromyography (EMG), respirometer (RSP), electrocardiography (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). In the last, declarative stage, participants filled out a series of questionnaires related to the experience of interacting with (chat)bots and to the overall human–(chat)bot collaboration assessment. The theory of planned behaviour survey investigated attitude towards cooperation with chatbots in the future. The social presence survey checked how much the chatbot was considered to be a “real” person. The anthropomorphism scale measured the extent to which the chatbot seems humanlike. Our particular focus was on the so-called uncanny valley effect, consisting of the feeling of eeriness and discomfort towards a given medium or technology that frequently appears in various kinds of human–machine interactions. Our results show that participants were experiencing lesser uncanny effects and less negative affect in cooperation with a simpler text chatbot than with the more complex, animated avatar chatbot. The simple chatbot have also induced less intense psychophysiological reactions. Despite major developments in botics, the user’s affective responses towards bots have frequently been neglected. In our view, understanding the user’s side may be crucial for designing better chatbots in the future and, thus, can contribute to advancing the field of human–computer interaction."

Results showed significant differences in the total use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and more specifically, revealed significant differences in the use of each metacognitive strategy (e.g., judgment of learning), but not each cognitive strategy (e.g., taking notes) between prior knowledge groups. Results also revealed different sequences of use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and that students spent different amounts of time engaging in SRL processes; however, all students visited similar numbers of relevant pages.

The literature suggests that such conflicts are routinely resolved in favor of a belief-based heuristic (Type 1) response that is generated autonomously and by default. Given sufficient effort, time, and motivation, reasoners can and sometimes do engage in more deliberative (Type 2) processing and intervene on default responses, generating responses based upon the underlying structure of the problem. Such default interventionist accounts of reasoning biases have become increasingly popular in the reasoning and judgment domains. In this chapter we review recent evidence which suggests that reasoners show intuitive sensitivity to logical structure, which can interfere with belief or knowledge judgments. We further show that the tendency to respond on the basis of beliefs can be slow and effortful, can increase with development, and often depends upon working memory. We evaluate the implications of these findings for dual process accounts and conclude that existing dual process frameworks cannot account for the evidence. Finally, we sketch the principles of a new model which assumes that both structure and knowledge make intuitive and deliberative contributions to responses on reasoning and judgment tasks."

In this Review, we discuss advances in computational neuroscience that relate to psychiatry. We review computational psychiatry in terms of the ambitions of investigators, emerging domains of application, and future work. Our focus is on theoretical formulations of brain function that put subjective beliefs and behaviour within formal (computational) frameworks—frameworks that can be grounded in neurophysiology down to the level of synaptic mechanisms. Understanding the principles that underlie the brain's functional architecture might be essential for an informed phenotyping of psychopathology in terms of its pathophysiological underpinnings. We focus on active (Bayesian) inference and predictive coding. Specifically, we show how basic principles of neuronal computation can be used to explain psychopathology, ranging from impoverished theory of mind in autism to abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye movements in schizophrenia."

This phenomenon comes into play also in other human pursuits such as dance and music. When listening to music, we spontaneously perceive and predict its beat. The process of beat perception comprises both beat inference and beat maintenance, their relative importance depending on the salience of beat in the music. To study functional connectivity associated with these processes in a naturalistic situation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain responses of participants while they were listening to a piece of music containing strong contrasts in beat salience. Subsequently, we utilized dynamic graph analysis and psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis in connection with computational modelling of beat salience to investigate how functional connectivity manifests these processes. As the main effect, correlation analyses between the obtained dynamic graph measures and the beat salience measure revealed increased centrality in auditory-motor cortices, cerebellum, and extrastriate visual areas during low beat salience, whereas regions of the default mode- and central executive networks displayed high centrality during high beat salience. PPI analyses revealed partial dissociation of functional networks belonging to this pathway indicating complementary neural mechanisms crucial in beat inference and maintenance, processes pivotal for extracting and predicting temporal regularities in our environment."

Appearance schematicity consists of two components. The self-evaluative component concerns the degree to which appearance is central to self-worth, referred to as dysfunctional appearance beliefs. Motivational salience refers to the engagement in behaviors designed to enhance appearance, such as body surveillance. Based on a three-wave panel survey of 973 Flemish preadolescents (Mage = 11.15, SD = 1.13) we found that the motivational and self-evaluative components had a different impact on media internalization. For preadolescents who engaged in more body surveillance, watching television resulted in more media internalization. For preadolescents who had fewer dysfunctional appearance beliefs, watching television resulted in more media internalization. These findings suggest that appearance schematicity is an important susceptibility variable in the relationship between TV-exposure and media internalization, and emphasize the importance of investigating individual dispositions beyond gender differences."

Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer’s beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon’s sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction."

abstract = "Obesity is increasing in countries undergoing nutrition transition (e.g., Nepal) largely due to changing food environments. Food choices are influenced by marketing and packaging, including front-of-pack nutrition claims (FOPNCs). Although FOPNCs can help consumers identify healthful foods, these claims can also lead consumers to unduly attribute healthfulness to unhealthful food products. This study investigated the effects of FOPNCs on consumers’ purchase intentions and product perceptions of snack foods. Participants were 239 adult shoppers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Participants viewing product images rated purchase intentions and seven product perceptions (e.g., healthfulness, tastiness). Participants reported their two most important shopping priorities, and explained why they found a specific FOPNC to be truthful/influential or not. Path analyses of multiple mediation models showed that FOPNCs most often influenced the product perception of healthful for children, while product perceptions of tasty and adults like it were most predictive of purchase intention. Inductive thematic analysis of open-ended responses identified various reasons for trust and skepticism in FOPNCs. FOPNCs were largely described as useful, despite their inconsistent influence on perceptions. Thematic analysis of shopping priorities resulted in 10 themes; the three most prevalent were quality, familiarity, and taste. Only 12% of reported shopping priorities appeared to motivate the use of FOPNCs (i.e., health and nutrition and package labeling). Evidence that FOPNCs create health halos for snack foods did emerge. However, FOPNCs’ inconsistent or absent impact on most product perceptions and purchase intentions suggest that FOPNCs are not a primary contributor to increasing obesity during Nepal’s nutrition transition."

This diversity of use increases the complexity of uncovering unobserved heterogeneity bias in the success of MB systems. This research, first, uses a study of objective measures to cluster 4478 MB users into three homogeneous segments based on the system utilization behaviors captured in the log data. The users were, then, surveyed using a field study of subjective measures based on the information systems (IS) success model. A priori sample segmentation used for facilitating the discovery of unobserved heterogeneity bias in the full sample. The analysis of the subset with 445 users who responded indicated that the path coefficient and explained variances (R2) of the IS model were higher in the segments compared to the full sample; and the influence of success factors on satisfaction and intention to use varied significantly among the segments. Our study, consisting of objective and subjective measures, has theoretical and practical implications for MB usage. It contributes to the IS success model by confirming the existence of unobserved bias in full sample and inconsistent effects of the quality factors on satisfaction and continued usage in the segmented samples. It also assists the banks in identifying MB features that are more appealing to the varying user groups, which could help them with customer retention."

Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom.

Television (TV) is a key socialization agent, especially amongst youth. According to cultivation theory, youth heavily exposed to TV content, where positive images of smoking and drinking abound, should hold more positive beliefs concerning drinking and smoking outcomes. This research investigates the role of the sensation-seeking personality trait in moderating this TV cultivation effect.
Methods
A French national research company contacted its panel members with children aged 13–17. Parents completed a short survey and were asked for consent for their child to participate in a study. The children were then contacted, informed, and asked for assent. Assenters completed a survey that included measures of TV exposure, personality traits, drinking and smoking behaviors, and beliefs about the outcomes associated with drinking and smoking (expectancies). Parental drinking, smoking, and strictness were included as controls.
Results
Survey data from 1040 adolescents (54.2% males) and their parents reveal that the relationship between cumulative TV exposure and drinking and smoking behavior, mediated through expectancies, is strongest amongst high sensation seeking adolescents. The moderated mediation analysis shows that sensation seeking trait moderates the relationship between TV exposure and the beliefs adolescents hold about the consequences of alcohol and tobacco use, which themselves are related to greater likelihood to engage in substance use.
Conclusion
Key personality traits and TV exposure levels must be accounted for to identify youth at risk of using substances at a time when many lifelong maladaptive behaviors and beliefs form."

Although students' judgments of task difficulty and invested mental effort are closely related to their study behaviors, it is still an open question how the accuracy of these judgments can be improved in learning from problem solving. The present study focused on the impact of three types of instructional support on the accuracy of students' judgments of difficulty and invested mental effort in relation to their performance while learning genetics in a computer-based environment. Sixty-seven university students with different prior knowledge received either incomplete worked-out examples, completion problems, or conventional problems. Results indicated that lower prior knowledge students performed better with completion problems, while higher prior knowledge students performed better with conventional problems. Incomplete worked-out examples resulted in an overestimation of performance, that is, an illusion of understanding, whereas completion and conventional problems showed neither over- nor underestimation. The findings suggest that completion problems can be used to avoid students' misjudgments of their competencies."

In the present paper, 103 ten-year-old children learnt to tie complex nautical knots from either a video of hand movements or from a static graphics presentation. Experiment 1 extended previous studies in the field using a conventional sequential presentation of the knots, under four conditions (long-section animation, short-section animation, long-section static graphics and short-section static graphics), but in a more “ecological” learning task than the majority of previous studies, involving a combination of observation and practice. In Experiment 2, with the same task and the same conditions, transience was reduced using animated simultaneous presentations. Results showed that long-section animation did not always lose its superiority over static graphics in this type of learning task. In addition to the transient information effect of the cognitive load theory, complementary explanations in terms of inhibition processes, attentional continuity and task affordance are suggested."

This preliminary study examined whether implicit doping attitude, explicit doping attitude, or both, predicted athletes’ vigilance towards unintentional doping.
Design
A cross-sectional correlational design.
Methods
Australian athletes (N=143;Mage=18.13, SD=4.63) completed measures of implicit doping attitude (brief single-category implicit association test), explicit doping attitude (Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale), avoidance of unintentional doping (Self-Reported Treatment Adherence Scale), and behavioural vigilance task of unintentional doping (reading the ingredients of an unfamiliar food product).
Results
Positive implicit doping attitude and explicit doping attitude were negatively related to athletes’ likelihood of reading the ingredients table of an unfamiliar food product, and positively related to athletes’ vigilance towards unintentional doping. Neither attitude measures predicted avoidance of unintentional doping. Overall, the magnitude of associations by implicit doping attitude appeared to be stronger than that of explicit doping attitude.
Conclusions
Athletes with positive implicit and explicit doping attitudes were less likely to read the ingredients table of an unknown food product, but were more likely to be aware of the possible presence of banned substances in a certain food product. Implicit doping attitude appeared to explain athletes’ behavioural response to the avoidance of unintentional doping beyond variance explained by explicit doping attitude."

We examined visual avoidance in 56 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, 43 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and 34 healthy controls. Participants came to our laboratory and viewed an extremely disgusting film clip while visual avoidance was measured using behavioral coding of head, body, and eye position. Controlling for differences in cognitive functioning, bvFTD patients were less likely to engage in visual avoidance behaviors than both AD patients and healthy controls. Additional analyses revealed that diminished visual avoidance in this task was associated with lower levels of real-world emotion regulation but not with emotion reactivity as reported by the primary caregiver."

Furthermore, stakeholders may be influenced by solutions of existing software without knowing if these actually suit the software to be developed. To cope with the above issues, it is important to understand the complete task, before designing a software system to support the task. Thus, we developed a method called Grounded Requirements Engineering (GRE) that leverages the Grounded Theory method to observe and analyze processes and user activities in the real world. GRE is an iterative process consisting of two steps. First, Grounded Theory methods are used to analyze user experiments or interviews. Second, the resulting abstract descriptions of the user behavior are transferred into use cases. GRE produces comprehensible and grounded requirements for the software system to be built, i.e. the requirements are traceable back to their origins. In this paper, we provide an elaborate description of the GRE method and illustrate it by applying it to derive requirements for an interactive software tool for model merging. The development of this tool both served as a basis for the design of GRE as well as to test it."

A broad range of theories and approaches to assess consumer response to innovations have been developed in the past. Many of these approaches have in common that information about the innovative product and/or its attributes lead to perceptions or attitudes toward the innovative product. Positive attitudes in turn lead to positive responses and subsequently to more consumers buying the product. Modern insights of consumer behavior show that the picture is not as straightforward. Implicit, often unconscious, gut feelings and the influence of the environment are also influencing consumer choice even without the awareness of the consumers themselves. Finally, alternative insights of theoretical approaches based on automatic behavior and implicit associations are presented, whereas mainstream and alternative methodologies to measure consumer response are denoted."

Existing computational models for solving RPM problems generally reason over amodal propositional representations of test inputs. However, there is considerable evidence that humans can also apply imagery-based reasoning strategies to RPM problems, in which processes rooted in perception operate over modal representations of test inputs. In this paper, we present the “affine model,” a computational model that simulates modal reasoning by using iconic visual representations together with affine and set transformations over these representations to solve a given RPM problem. Various configurations of the affine model successfully solve between 33 and 38 of the 60 problems on the Standard Progressive Matrices, which matches levels of performance for typically developing 9- to 11-year-old children. This suggests that, for at least a sizeable subset of RPM problems, it is not always necessary to extract amodal symbols in order to arrive at the correct answer, and iconic visual representations constitute a sufficient form of representation to successfully solve these problems. We intend for the affine model to serve as a complementary computational account to existing propositional models, which together may provide an integrated, dual-process account of human problem solving on the RPM."

By introducing a novel experimental paradigm that can dissociate the electrophysiological responses to motion processing and the global shape processing of BM, we found that: (1) the timing of the response was preserved in ASD groups, whereas (2) the ERP response to BM was significantly enhanced compared with scrambled point-light motion (SM) in normal controls; the responses to both BM and SM were not significantly different in subjects with ASD. Because we did not find a significant group effect on the peak and mean amplitude induced by BM, it is presumed that this atypical response in individuals with ASD was due to over-sensitivity to the local motion signals. This experimental paradigm showed atypical local motion processing of BM in individuals with ASD."

This abstract task representation paradigm may explain a cognitive benefit of dynamic instructional visualisations over static alternative in the acquisition of novel procedural motor skills. In this sequel work, we explore and extend this view through empirical investigations of novel skill acquisitions in a separate but related domain of spatial navigation. We compare the post-learning virtual maze navigational performance of sixty novel learners across two groups. After controlling for spatial orientation ability and prior video gaming experience, participants that learned the task using dynamic instructional visualisations recorded significantly better performance measures than those in the static group. Additionally, within-group comparisons also show that the beneficial advantage of dynamic instructional visualisations over statics remained consistent across different task complexities. These findings provide further evidence to support the view that dynamic instructional visualisations afford more efficient transfer of novel procedural skills through computer based training than static visualisations. This has implications for instructional design especially when rapid novel situational awareness is desired such as in briefings for emergency firefighting or tactical military operations."

abstract = "Our ability to make predictions and monitor regularities has a profound impact on the way we perceive the environment, but the effect this mechanism has on memory is not well understood. In four experiments, we explored the effects on memory of the expectation status of information at encoding or at retrieval. In a rule-learning task participants learned a contingency relationship between 6 different symbols and the type of stimulus that followed each one. Either at encoding (Experiments 1a and 1b) or at retrieval (Experiments 2a and 2b), the established relationship was violated for a subset of stimuli resulting in the presentation of both expected and unexpected stimuli. The expectation status of the stimuli was found to have opposite effects on familiarity and recollection performance, the two kinds of memory that support recognition memory. At encoding (Experiments 1a and 1b), the presentation of expected stimuli selectively enhanced subsequent familiarity performance, while unexpected stimuli selectively enhanced subsequent recollection. Similarly, at retrieval (Experiments 2a and 2b), expected stimuli were more likely to be deemed familiar than unexpected stimuli, whereas unexpected stimuli were more likely to be recollected than were expected stimuli. These findings suggest that two separate memory enhancement mechanisms exist; one sensitive and modulating the accuracy of memory for the contextually distinctive or unexpected, and the other sensitive to and modulating the accuracy of memory for the expected. Therefore, the degree to which information fits with expectation has critical implications for the type of computational mechanism that will be engaged to support memory."

Originally conceptualized by developmental psychologists to study the human-human relationship, it could also apply to cross-species interactions. Here, we examined synchrony patterns as a potentially important mechanism to evaluate human-dog interactions during animal-assisted activities. Four dog handler-dog dyads were videotaped before (T0), during (T1), and after (T2) 45-minute sessions of animal-assisted activities and coded for the following synchrony patterns: gaze synchrony, joint attention, and touch synchrony. Both partners' salivary cortisol and heart rate and dogs' behaviors were measured to identify any signs of stress that would lower levels of synchrony. All dyads showed synchronous behaviors in T0 and T1, whereas these were absent in T2. On average, the highest frequency was recorded in T1 (P < 0.05), particularly with regard to joint attention. All dogs fulfilled most of their handler's cues (74%; P < 0.05) while working with a patient, showing appropriate levels of cooperation. No stress-related signs were detected in either the dogs or their human handlers. These findings highlight the human-dog bonding as one prototypical context for studying the biologic basis of cross-species social synchrony. This may also generate evidence-based knowledge that can help strengthen the scientific foundation of current canine-assisted intervention practices."

Based on studies of packaging design, cross-modal correspondences, and food science, this research establishes a “packaging visual-gustatory correspondence effect” whereby the image of a food product placed at the bottom (vs. top) of the package façade enhances consumers’ expectations (Study 1A) and actual perceptions (Study 1B) of the food’s flavor heaviness. Further, this effect carries over to help consumers make healthier eating decisions such as eating less of the food (Study 2) and subsequently choosing a healthier snack (Study 3). This research also shows that the packaging visual-gustatory correspondence effect is moderated by consumers’ processing style such that those who engage in holistic (vs. analytic) processing are more affected by the location of the food image on the package façade (Study 4). Our theoretically novel findings are also conducive to addressing the self-control dilemma: The location of the food image on the package façade can serve to increase flavor perception but decrease consumption quantity."

Ecological validity was optimized by avoiding any artificial interference to manipulate drivers ML, drivers were alone in the car, they were free to choose their paths to the target, and the repeated drives familiarized drivers to the procedure. Our aim was to investigate if driver's physiological variables can be reliably measured and used as predictors of moderate individual levels of ML in naturally occurring unpredictably changing field conditions. Variables investigated were: heart-rate, skin conductance level, breath duration, blink frequency, blink duration, and eye fixation related potentials. After the drives, with support from video uptakes, a self-rating and a score made by external raters were used to distinguish moderately high and low ML segments. Variability was high but aggregated data could distinguish city from highway drives. Multivariate models could successfully classify high and low ML within highway and city drives using physiological variables as input. In summary, physiological variables have a potential to be used as indicators of moderate ML in unpredictably changing field conditions and to advance the evaluation and development of new active safety systems."

abstract = "Elucidating the neurobiological effects of sleep and wake is an important goal of the neurosciences. Whether and how human cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes during the sleep-wake cycle remain to be clarified. Based on the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep and wake, we hypothesized that a day of wake and a night of sleep deprivation would be associated with gray matter resting CBF (rCBF) increases and that sleep would be associated with rCBF decreases. Thirty-eight healthy adult males (age 22.1 ± 2.5 years) underwent arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging at three time points: in the morning after a regular night's sleep, the evening of the same day, and the next morning, either after total sleep deprivation (n = 19) or a night of sleep (n = 19). All analyses were adjusted for hematocrit and head motion. rCBF increased from morning to evening and decreased after a night of sleep. These effects were most prominent in bilateral hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and in the occipital and sensorimotor cortices. Group × time interaction analyses for evening versus next morning revealed significant interaction in bilateral lateral and medial occipital cortices and in bilateral insula, driven by rCBF increases in the sleep deprived individuals and decreases in the sleepers, respectively. Furthermore, group × time interaction analyses for first morning versus next morning showed significant effects in medial and lateral occipital cortices, in anterior cingulate gyrus, and in the insula, in both hemispheres. These effects were mainly driven by CBF increases from TP1 to TP3 in the sleep deprived individuals. There were no associations between the rCBF changes and sleep characteristics, vigilant attention, or subjective sleepiness that remained significant after adjustments for multiple analyses. Altogether, these results encourage future studies to clarify mechanisms underlying sleep-related rCBF changes."

The ability to drive is often affected after stroke. In approximately 30% of stroke survivors, it is clear from the onset that driving will no longer be possible. Approximately 33% of survivors will be able to return to driving with little or no retraining, and 35% will require driving-related rehabilitation before they can resume safe driving again. The ability to drive is not routinely evaluated after stroke, and there is no established rehabilitation program for poststroke driving. When driving evaluation does occur, it is not always clear which tests are the most salient for accurately assessing poststroke driving ability. Investigators have examined the efficacy of various methodologies to predict driving performance after stroke and have found mixed results, with each method having unique weaknesses, including poor predictive ability, poor face validity, poor sensitivity or specificity, and limited reliability. Here we review common models of driving to gain insight into why single-construct visual or cognitive off-road measures are inadequate for evaluating driving, a complex and dynamic activity that involves timely interaction of multiple motor, visual, cognitive, and perceptual skills. We also examine the potential for driving simulators to overcome the problems currently faced in the evaluation and rehabilitation of driving after stroke. Finally, we offer suggestions for the future direction of simulator-based poststroke driving evaluation and training."

These features could foster deep processing of material by promoting relational processes between the relevant parts of information. Such processes are expected to support the construction of meanings. Nevertheless, because the cognitive system's capacities are limited, relational processing could be difficult to run. In this paper, we examined three sets of research about learning with (a) multiple representations, (b) animations and (c) hypertexts. The conclusions confirmed that these digital documents could support deep processing by requiring relational processing, but only under some circumstances (i.e., learners with high cognitive abilities and guidance principles).
Résumé
Les supports multimédia pour l’apprentissage offrent des formats de présentation des contenus et des tâches multiples (e.g., lecture, exploration, manipulation des informations). Leurs caractéristiques peuvent aider les traitements profonds des contenus en favorisant des processus relationnels entre les différentes parties des contenus. Il est attendu que de tels processus permettent la construction du sens. Néanmoins, parce que les capacités du système cognitif sont limitées, les traitements relationnels peuvent se révéler difficiles à mettre en œuvre. Dans cet article, trois types de recherche sur l’apprentissage avec des documents numériques ont été examinés : (a) apprentissage à partir des représentations multiples, (b) apprentissage à partir d’animations, et (c) apprentissage à partir d’hypertextes. Les conclusions confirment que ces documents numériques peuvent favoriser les traitements profonds des contenus par la mise en oeuvre de processus relationnels, mais sous certaines conditions (i.e., apprenants porteurs d’habilités cognitives et principes d’aide et de guidage dans les documents numériques)."

However, direct evidence for age differences in brain functional activation and connectivity during emotional processing and concomitant behavioral implications is lacking. In the present study, we examined the impact of aging on the neural signature of selective attention to emotional information during working memory (WM) encoding. Participants completed an emotional WM task in which they were asked to attend to emotional targets and ignore irrelevant distractors. Despite an overall reduction in accuracy for older relative to younger adults, no behavioral age effect was observed as a function of emotional valence. The functional connectivity patterns of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed that younger adults recruited one network for encoding of both positive and negative emotional targets and this network contributed to higher memory accuracy in this cohort. Older adults, on the other hand, engaged two distinct networks for encoding of positive and negative targets. The functional connectivity analysis using left amygdala further demonstrated that older adults recruited one single network during encoding of positive as well as negative targets whereas younger adults recruited this network only for encoding of negative items. The engagement of amygdala functional network also contributed to higher memory performance and faster response times in older adults. Our findings provide novel insights into the differential roles of functional brain networks connected to the medial PFC and amygdala during encoding of emotionally-valenced items with advancing age."

Thus, this chapter first identifies few key dimensions (components) in HDR QoE and then discusses the impact of HDR processing on few of them. In particular, we find that operations such as tone mapping (and inverse tone mapping) can alter the artistic intent of HDR content, and thus need to be considered in the design and development of HDR video processing algorithms."

Previous studies focused on investigating the separate effects of anxiety, cognitive load, and expertise on perceptual-motor performance, but the combined effects of these factors have not been studied yet. The objective of the current study was to investigate these factors in combination.
Design
Eleven expert dart players and nine novices performed a dart throwing task in low-anxiety (LA) and high-anxiety (HA) conditions with and without a secondary task.
Method
To manipulate anxiety the dart throwing task was performed low (LA) and high (HA) on a climbing wall with and without the secondary counting backwards task. Performance and efficiency of task execution and gaze behavior were assessed.
Results
The anxiety manipulation evoked a decrease in dart performance, but only for the novices. Increases in mental effort and dart times and a decrease in response rate on the secondary task were observed for both groups. This shows that there were decreases in processing efficiency with anxiety. Most important, the anxiety-induced decrease in performance for the novices was accompanied by final fixations on the target that were substantially shorter and deviated off the target earlier. The dual task did not affect performance.
Conclusion
Anxiety affects efficiency and sometimes performance in far aiming tasks. Changes are accompanied by changes in gaze behavior, particularly the final fixation on the target. All in all, findings provide support for Attentional Control Theory as a suitable framework to explain the effects of anxiety, a cognitive secondary task, and expertise in far aiming tasks."

Older adults generally make slower and shorter initial impulses towards the end target, and therefore require more time for corrections in the final movement stage. Recent studies however suggest that a physically active lifestyle may attenuate these age-related changes. Also, it remains unclear whether eye-movement control exhibits a similar pattern of adaptation in older adults. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to describe how age and physical activity level impact eye–hand coordination during discrete manual aiming. Young and older participants were divided into physically active and sedentary subgroups, and performed discrete aiming movements while hand and eye movements were recorded. Secondly, to determine whether older adults depend more on vision during aiming, the task was repeated without visual feedback. The results revealed that the typical age-related hand movement adaptations were not only observed in older, but also in sedentary young participants. Older and sedentary young participants also spent more hand movement time after the eyes fixated the end target. This finding does not necessarily reflect an augmented reliance on vision, as all groups showed similar aiming errors when visual feedback was removed. In conclusion, both age and physical activity level clearly impacted eye–hand coordination during discrete manual aiming. This adapted coordination pattern seems to be caused by other factors than an increased reliance on vision."
