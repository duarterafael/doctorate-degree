abstract = "Single bouts of exercise have been observed to enhance numerous domains of cognition including inhibitory aspects of cognitive control and neuroelectric indices of attention. Given that the locus-coeruleus norepinephrine system regulates alertness and attention, this system may underlie these exercise-induced enhancements. The present study used pupillometry to examine the extent to which a single bout of exercise induces changes in aspects of locus-coeruleus activation, as well as the extent to which changes in locus-coeruleus activation were associated with changes in inhibition and neuroelectric indices of attention. Using a within-participants crossover design, behavioral, neuroelectric, and pupillometric measures were assessed in response to an inhibitory control task before and after 20-min of either aerobic exercise or an active-control condition during two separate, counterbalanced sessions. The aerobic exercise condition consisted of walking/jogging on a motor driven treadmill at an intensity of approximately 70% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. The active control condition consisted of walking on the treadmill at 0.5 mph and 0% grade. Replicating prior findings, enhancements in both reaction time and neuroelectric indices of attention were observed in response to the exercise condition. However, neither the exercise nor the active control conditions were observed to induce changes in activation of the locus-coeruleus as indexed by pupil size, and changes in activation of the locus-coeruleus were not associated with exercise-induced changes in inhibition and neuroelectric indices of attention. Accordingly, these findings provide evidence to suggest that activation of the locus-coeruleus is not a mechanism underlying exercise-induced enhancements in cognition."

This paper proposes a knowledge-based risk mapping tool for systematically assessing risk-related variables that may lead to cost overrun in international markets. The tool uses an ontology that relates risk and vulnerability to cost overrun [1] and a novel risk-vulnerability assessment methodology [2] to estimate potential risk paths that may emerge in international construction projects. The tool has been developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, a construction management company that gives risk management consultancy services to Turkish contractors working in international markets. The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool. As the reliability and usability of the tool significantly depend on the subjective evaluations of users about level of vulnerability and magnitude of potential risk events, a lessons learned database has been incorporated into the tool so that decision-makers may refer to risk event histories of previous projects to make estimations about forthcoming projects. In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool. Although the usability and reliability test results are satisfactory, the tool should be seen as an initial platform which should be improved by increasing its “intelligence” by high quality and enough number of risk event histories, and also customized according to user preferences as well as company policies."

abstract = "The notion that prediction is a fundamental principle of human information processing has been en vogue over recent years. The investigation of language processing may be particularly illuminating for testing this claim. Linguists traditionally have argued prediction plays only a minor role during language understanding because of the vast possibilities available to the language user as each word is encountered. In the present review I consider four central questions of anticipatory language processing: Why (i.e. what is the function of prediction in language processing)? What (i.e. what are the cues used to predict up-coming linguistic information and what type of representations are predicted)? How (what mechanisms are involved in predictive language processing and what is the role of possible mediating factors such as working memory)? When (i.e. do individuals always predict up-coming input during language processing)? I propose that prediction occurs via a set of diverse PACS (production-, association-, combinatorial-, and simulation-based prediction) mechanisms which are minimally required for a comprehensive account of predictive language processing. Models of anticipatory language processing must be revised to take multiple mechanisms, mediating factors, and situational context into account. Finally, I conjecture that the evidence considered here is consistent with the notion that prediction is an important aspect but not a fundamental principle of language processing. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Prediction and Attention."

abstract = "Driving is a high-demanding task, related to human capacity, required performance and events occurring in the external environment. Mental workload depends on numerous factors: task difficulty, task complexity, level of traffic, additional activities required by the driving action or imposed by the driver, the contextual conditions, as well as the individual response to stress. The study of driver's workload is crucial in guiding future car design, in order to improve the user experience, comfort as well as driving performance and safety. Indeed, if task demands are too high in relation to the user's capabilities, errors may occur and may become critical for safety. The present paper defines a transdisciplinary approach based on monitoring the driver's workload during driving tasks in order to map the perceived user experience, and finally understand the interaction between the driver and the car systems. The approach is based on three layers: the human conditions to detect, the vital parameters to be monitored, and the adopted monitoring technologies. The paper proposes: a protocol to monitor the driver's workload during both real and simulated tasks, a technological set-up including physiological and performance data collection, and a proper data elaboration strategy. The key findings are: the selection of the most relevant subjective and objective parameters to measure the driver's mental workload, the definition of a preliminary technological set-up for monitoring the workload during simulated driving, and the evaluation of the effects of task complexity and of a secondary task on driver's performance. The research paved the way to further studies about how to miniaturize and embed sensors inside the car for a less intrusive application during real driving. Results can also be used to assess the interaction with car devices and to compare different design alternatives."

These include social sciences primarily involving the collecting data from people and about people. They are no longer limited to surveys and interviews, but, using the new technologies, they go much deeper - not only to the conscious declarations of the participants, but also to their subconscious opinions and beliefs. In this context, cognitive neuroscience techniques appear. Thanks to the use of tools previously associated mainly with medicine, they allow you to gain new information on people’s preferences, feelings, unconscious opinions, etc. However, in order for this information to be extracted, data collected with the use of such tools must be treated with a number of algorithms that will help to extract what is most important. In order to achieve this, data mining methods are used. However, the conducted procedure must be adapted to the specifics of this data. The aim of the article is to characterize the data that is collected using the cognitive neuroscience techniques, presenting the following stages of its processing and analysis, and methods that are commonly used, so that it is possible to obtain valuable information that will allow the researchers to draw the right conclusions. Such procedure will be presented on the example of research on measuring the effectiveness of media messages in social campaigns."

To do this, we need to focus on rigorously modeling and measuring the underlying processes causing these effects, and use the Simonson et al. proposal to provide some examples. I also present some examples from research in decision-making and decision neuroscience, and argue that models that fail, and fail spectacularly are particularly useful.

(1) To assess whether Front-of-Pack (FOP) nutrition labels garner attention more readily than more complete, mandated nutrition information (the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP), required in the US), and (2) To determine whether label design characteristics, specifically, color coding and/or coding with facial icons, increase attention to the FOP label.
Methods
In two experiments, we tracked the allocation of attention while participants (n=125) viewed novel and commercial packages with varied FOP designs using a change detection methodology.
Results
We found empirical evidence that FOP labels are attended more often, and earlier, than the currently mandated NFP, and that this benefit is due both to its placement on the front of the package and to the design characteristics of the FOP. Specifically, the use of color in FOPs increased attention to the label, but there was no evidence that coding information via facial icons impacted attention.
Conclusions
Our work supports a growing body of evidence supporting the use of FOP labels to attract attention to nutritional information. Findings may be relevant to inform policy decisions on labeling standards."

This research examines how two techniques, inflated product claims and website interactivity, affect consumer evaluations of retailer websites. According to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), the authors argue that the use of strong, even inflated product claims leads to stronger website evaluations. The positive effects of inflated claims are bounded by website interactivity, which functions as a heuristic of the trustworthiness of a retailer's claims and website. Two studies demonstrate consistently that when website interactivity is high, the effects of inflated product claims are enhanced, whereas they are attenuated when website interactivity is low."

Experts often struggle to explicate and/or verbalize their knowledge or simply overlook important details due to internalization of their skills, which may make it more difficult for apprentices to learn from experts. In addition, the shortage of experts to support apprentices in one-to-one settings during trainings limits the development of apprentices. In this review, we investigate how augmented reality and sensor technology can be used to capture expert performance in such a way that the captured performance can be used to train apprentices without increasing the workload on experts. To this end, we have analysed 78 studies that have implemented augmented reality and sensor technology for training purposes. We explored how sensors have been used to capture expert performance with the intention of supporting apprentice training. Furthermore, we classified the instructional methods used by the studies according to the 4C/ID framework to understand how augmented reality and sensor technology have been used to support training. The results of this review show that augmented reality and sensor technology have the potential to capture expert performance for training purposes. The results also outline a methodological approach to how sensors and augmented reality learning environments can be designed for training using recorded expert performance."

We report two visual-world studies investigating how knowledge about a character’s basic preferences (e.g. Tom’s favourite colour is pink) and higher-order desires (his wish to keep this preference secret) compete to influence online expectations about subsequent behaviour. Participants’ eye movements around a visual scene were tracked while they listened to auditory narratives. While clear differences in anticipatory visual biases emerged between conditions in Experiment 1, post-hoc analyses testing the strength of the relevant biases suggested a discrepancy in the time-course of predicting appropriate referents within the different contexts. Specifically, predictions to the target emerged very early when there was no conflict between the character’s basic preferences and higher-order desires, but appeared to be relatively delayed when comprehenders were provided with conflicting information about that character’s desire to keep a secret. However, a second experiment demonstrated that this apparent ‘cognitive cost’ in inferring behaviour based on higher-order desires was in fact driven by low-level features between the context sentence and visual scene. Taken together, these results suggest that healthy adults are able to make complex higher-order ToM inferences without the need to call on costly cognitive processes. Results are discussed relative to previous accounts of ToM and language processing."

Most drivers showed greater anxiety scores and higher mean heart rates following manipulation. In both groups increased state anxiety decreased car speed control and caused more collisions, accompanied by fewer fixations of longer duration towards the driving lane across a horizontally narrower region. Inexperienced drivers increased the number of short fixations towards cars, while experienced drivers increased the number of short fixations on the speedometer. Although anxiety impairs processing efficiency and performance effectiveness for both groups, attentional changes differ as a function of experience.

Participants (N = 16) were either automation-inexperienced drivers or automation-experienced Tesla owners. Complexity ranged from an engaging environment with a road geometry stimulating continuous traffic interaction, and a monotonic environment with lower traffic density and a simple road geometry. Perceived and objective workload increased with traffic complexity. When using the automation, automation-experienced drivers perceived a lower workload, while automation-inexperienced drivers perceived their workload to be similar to manual driving. However, the detection-response task indicated an increase in cognitive load with automation, in particular in complex traffic. This indicates that drivers under-estimate the actual task load of attentive monitoring. The findings also highlight the relevance of using system-experienced participants and the importance of incorporating both objective and subjective measures when examining workload."

In both experiments, the use of a modified remember/know procedure led to high confidence and matched accuracy levels characterising strong familiarity (F3) and recollection (R) responses. In Experiment 1, visual scanning behaviour at retrieval distinguished familiarity-based from recollection-based recognition. Recollection, relative to strength-matched familiarity, involved significantly larger pupil dilations and more dispersed fixation patterns. In Experiment 2, the hippocampus was selectively activated for recollected stimuli, while no evidence of activation was observed in the hippocampus for strong familiarity of matched accuracy. Recollection also activated the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), while the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) was actively engaged in response to strong familiarity (than to recollection). Activity in prefrontal and parietal areas differentiated familiarity and recollection in both the extent and the magnitude of activity they exhibited, while the dorsomedial thalamus showed selective familiarity-related activity, and the ventrolateral and anterior thalamus selective recollection-related activity. These findings are consistent with the view that the hippocampus and PRC play contrasting roles in supporting recollection and familiarity and that these differences are not a result of differences in memory strength. Overall, the combined pupil dilation, eye movement and fMRI data suggest the operation of recognition mechanisms drawing differentially on familiarity and recollection, whose neural bases are distinct within the MTL."

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are a valuable research model because of their behavioral, physiological and neuroanatomical similarities to humans. In the absence of language, autonomic activity can provide crucial information about cognitive and affective states during single-unit recording, inactivation and lesion studies. Methods standardized for use in humans are not easily adapted to NHPs and detailed guidance has been lacking.
New method
We provide guidance for monitoring heart rate and pupil size in the behavioral neurophysiology setting by addressing the methodological issues, pitfalls and solutions for NHP studies. The methods are based on comparative physiology to establish a rationale for each solution. We include examples from both electrophysiological and lesion studies.
Results
Single-unit recording, pupil responses and heart rate changes represent a range of decreasing temporal resolution, a characteristic that impacts experimental design and analysis. We demonstrate the unexpected result that autonomic measures acquired before and after amygdala lesions are comparable despite disruption of normal autonomic function.
Comparison with existing methods
Species and study design differences can render standard techniques used in human studies inappropriate for NHP studies. We show how to manage data from small groups typical of NHP studies, data from the short behavioral trials typical of neurophysiological studies, issues associated with longitudinal studies, and differences in anatomy and physiology.
Conclusions
Autonomic measurement to infer cognitive and affective states in NHP is neither off-the-shelf nor onerous. Familiarity with the issues and solutions will broaden the use of autonomic signals in NHP single unit and lesion studies."

The Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction Design (N=108) considers prior knowledge and spatial ability as continuous aptitude variables and seductive details (with vs. without) and task condition (cognitive low-loading single vs. cognitive high-loading dual task) as treatment variables. Two separate models of moderated mediation are focused including task condition as a first moderator and prior knowledge or spatial ability as a second moderator. Results show a full mediation by picture fixation duration with a moderating influence of task condition and prior knowledge on the mediator and a moderating influence of task condition and spatial ability on the direct path for learning success. Especially the low capacity learners were affected under cognitive high-loading conditions. A discussion of these results leads to different theoretical and practical implications."

abstract = "Objective
A driving simulator study was conducted to investigate the effect of cognitive distraction on different stages of perception-response time (saccade latency, processing time, and movement time) to unexpected roadway hazards, both when the hazard onset is abrupt and when it is gradual.
Background
Prior studies, which typically focus on overall response times, have demonstrated that distraction, including cognitive distraction, leads to an increase in response times. Studies have also shown that response times differ depending on the type and location of the hazard. However, there is limited research into the effect of cognitive distraction for gradually developing hazards (e.g., a left-turn across path vehicle), as existing research primarily focuses on abrupt hazard onsets (e.g., lead vehicle braking).
Method
Twenty-four participants were presented with three different emergency roadway hazards, including one abrupt onset hazard (a pedestrian stepping onto the roadway from in front of a parked vehicle) and two gradually developing hazards (an oncoming vehicle turning left across the driver’s path and a vehicle accelerating perpendicularly into the driver’s path from the right). Half of the participants completed a delayed digit recall task (cognitive distraction condition), the other half did not (control condition).
Results
The left-turn across path hazard was particularly characterized by the long processing period (initiation of the saccade towards the hazard to initial motor response), whereas the pedestrian hazard was more notable for the shortest saccadic latency (hazard onset to the start of the saccade towards the hazard). Cognitive distraction led to a significant increase in brake reaction time for the right-incursion vehicle hazard, in processing time for the left-turn across path hazard, and a marginally significant increase in saccadic latency for the pedestrian and right-incursion vehicle hazards.
Conclusion
Hazard ambiguity due to gradual onset, such as with the left-turn across path hazard, appears to increase the processing duration before a response is executed, especially when distracted. Abrupt hazard onset appears to induce shorter saccadic latencies than gradual onsets likely due to a stronger attentional capture property. However, cognitive distraction may increase saccadic latencies for these types of hazards."

The dependent variables included subjects’ pre-test, post-test, and retention-test scores, showing their understanding of mitosis and meiosis process at molecular level, as well as data of subjects’ eye-movement behavior. Results showed the group that received animation with narration allocated a greater amount of visual attention (number of fixations, total inspection time, and mean fixation duration) than the group that received animation with on-screen text, in both pictorial area and area of interest, which is consistent with students’ immediate and long-term retained learning of the processes of mitosis and meiosis. The group that received simulation with on-screen text allocated a greater amount of visual attention than the group that received simulation with narration, consistent with students’ immediate and retained learning. The group that received simulation with on-screen text also allocated a greater amount of visual attention than the group that received animation with on-screen text, consistent with students’ immediate and retained learning. This study adds empirical evidence of a direct correlation between the length of eye fixation behavior and the depth of learning. Moreover, it provides insight into the multimedia effect on students’ cognitive process through the use of eye fixation behavior evidence."

We investigated how the required cognitive operations such as reference processing, identification of critical items, and eventual handling of violations correlate with neuronal activity within the language network of the brain. To this end, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which we manipulated spoken discourse coherence by using presuppositions (PSPs) that either correspond or fail to correspond to items in preceding context sentences. Definite and indefinite determiners were used as PSP triggers, referring to (non-) uniqueness or (non-) existence of an item. Discourse adequacy was tested by means of a behavioral rating during fMRI. Discourse violations yielded bilateral hemodynamic activation within the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the inferior parietal lobe including the angular gyrus (IPL/AG), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and the basal ganglia (BG). These findings illuminate cognitive aspects of PSP processing: (1) a reference process requiring working memory (IFG), (2) retrieval and integration of semantic/pragmatic information (IPL/AG), (3) cognitive control of inconsistency management (pre-SMA/BG) in terms of “successful” comprehension despite PSP violations at the surface. These results provide the first fMRI evidence needed to develop a functional neuroanatomical model for context-dependent sentence comprehension based on the example of PSP processing."

The concept of multiple remote tower operation is that air traffic controllers (ATCOs) can control several airfields from a distant virtual control centre. The control of multiple airfields can be centralised to a virtual centre permitting the more efficient use of ATCO resources. This research was sponsored by the Single European Sky ATM Research Program and the ATM Operations Division of the Irish Aviation Authority. A safety case was developed for migration of multiple remote tower services to live operations. This research conducted 50 large scale demonstration trials of remote tower operations from single tower operations to multiple tower operations for safety assessment by air navigation safety regulators in 2016. A dedicated team of air traffic controllers and technology experts successfully completed the safety assessment of multiple remote tower operations in real time. The implementation of this innovative technology requires a careful balance between cost-efficiency and the safety of the air traffic control in terms of capacity and human performance. The live trial exercises demonstrated that the air traffic services provided by the remote tower for a single airport and two medium airports by a single ATCO with ‘in sequence’ and ‘simultaneous’ aircraft operation was at least as safe as provided by the local towers at Cork and Shannon aerodromes. No safety occurrence was reported nor did any operational safety issue arise during the conduct of the fifty live trial exercises."

abstract = "Cultures differ substantially in representations of the self. Whereas individualistic cultural groups emphasize an independent self, reflected in processing biases towards centralized salient objects, collectivistic cultures are oriented towards an interdependent self, attending to contextual associations between visual cues. It is unknown how these perceptual biases may affect brain activity in response to negative social cues. Moreover, while some studies have shown that individual differences in self-construal moderate cultural group comparisons, few have examined self-construal differences separate to culture. To investigate these issues, a final sample of a group of healthy participants high in trait levels of collectivistic self-construal (n=16) and individualistic self-construal (n=19), regardless of cultural background, completed a negative social cue evaluation task designed to engage face/object vs context-specific neural processes whilst undergoing fMRI scanning. Between-group analyses revealed that the collectivistic group exclusively engaged the parahippocampal gyrus (parahippocampal place area) – a region critical to contextual integration – during negative face processing – suggesting compensatory activations when contextual information was missing. The collectivist group also displayed enhanced negative context dependent brain activity involving the left superior occipital gyrus/cuneus and right anterior insula. By contrast, the individualistic group did not engage object or localized face processing regions as predicted, but rather demonstrated heightened appraisal and self-referential activations in medial prefrontal and temporoparietal regions to negative contexts – again suggesting compensatory processes when focal cues were absent. While individualists also appeared more sensitive to negative faces in the scenes, activating the right middle cingulate gyrus, dorsal prefrontal and parietal activations, this activity was observed relative to the scrambled baseline, and given that prefrontal and occipital regions were also engaged to neutral stimuli, may suggest an individualistic pattern to processing all social cues more generally. These findings suggest that individual differences in self-construal may be an important organizing framework facilitating perceptual processes to emotionally salient social cues, beyond the boundary of cultural group comparisons."

Alternate theories have been proposed within each context, based on field and experimental observations of human behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology has provided economists with an unmatched ability to test individual theories, and to resolve competing theories. In this chapter, I first outline economic theories relevant to fMRI technology, briefly describe what is meant by “brain activity” and explain how fMRI technology works in illuminating this activity. Then, I summarize findings from neuroeconomics experiments involving decisions in the different contexts introduced. I conclude the chapter by noting some limitations of using fMRI in experiments."

Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure increased with increasing self-rated arousal when valence was pleasant but much less when valence was unpleasant. Compared to women, men exhibited a stronger correlation between valence and HR and an SBP response characterized by larger increases for pleasant high-arousal states and lower change scores for unpleasant low- and high-arousal and pleasant low-arousal states. Men's largest SCL change scores were for pleasant high-arousal states, whereas women's largest SCL change scores were for unpleasant high-arousal states. The arousal–PS relationship was stronger among women, in particular for unpleasant series. From younger to older age, there were decreases in the strength of the valence–HR, arousal–SCL, and arousal–PS relationships. Older adults had larger overall increases in SBP and DBP than younger adults, but the relationships with self-reported valence and arousal were not age dependent. We discuss how the observed sex and age effects may reflect sex and age differences in emotional processing and in basic autonomic nervous system functioning."

Genital responses are typically assessed using vaginal photoplethysmography, a measure of vaginal vasocongestion, itself a precursor to lubrication. One explanation for low cue-specificity is the preparation hypothesis: Women genitally respond to almost all sexual cues because lubrication functions to protect genital organs from potential injury should vaginal penetration occur. In order to test the preparation hypothesis, both vaginal vasocongestion and introital lubrication were assessed in a sample of 20 women in response to sexually explicit films. While patterns of vasocongestion were consistent with low cue-specificity for gender cues and type of sexual activity, lubrication was specific to women’s most preferred sexual stimulus categories. These results are inconsistent with the preparation hypothesis."

For each participant we classified eye gaze data to construct models of their reading patterns. The reading models were analyzed with respect to the effect of task types and Web page types on reading eye movement patterns. We report on relationships between tasks and individual reading behaviors at the task and page level. Specifically we show that transitions between scanning and reading behavior in eye movement patterns and the amount of text processed may be an implicit indicator of the current task type facets. This may be useful in building user and task models that can be useful in personalization of information systems and so address design demands driven by increasingly complex user actions with information systems. One of the contributions of this research is a new methodology to model information search behavior and investigate information acquisition and cognitive processing in interactive information tasks."

The findings of the current research reveal that this effect occurs because consumers tend to pay more attention to alternatives that are similar to a recommended option.

When teachers speak of motivating their students, they refer to getting them on task, inducing them to pay attention, helping them complete assignments, and stimulating them towards asking probing questions. All the while, students feel relaxed, energized, joyous in their learning. Numerous theoretical frameworks have been tied to engagement, indicating its importance as a construct beyond any one single paradigm. Some models treat engagement as an outcome, others a dynamic pivot in the motivational process, and reciprocally related to student and teacher interactions. The topic has wide coverage in first language studies, and has been a topic of growing interest in education and educational psychology, but has had only limited adoption as a topic of study in language education. As a construct more easily recognizable to teachers, discussing engagement may help bridge the “black box” world of the classroom, the “impractical” world of educational theory, and the “uninformed” perspective of lay theorists. The current review covers the basic theoretical and methodological issues in measuring and using engagement as a construct for understanding second and foreign language learning in classrooms."

Specifically, we review and organize recent empirical and theoretical advances along four conceptual levels, spanning (1) the social human nature (affiliation and empathy), (2) social cognition (understanding others’ needs and one’s own competencies to help), (3) social interactions (social evaluation and social learning mechanisms), and (4) cultural learning (appropriation of cultural models). Besides having implications for the research and theorizing on infants’ early helping behavior, a developmental systems perspective on infants’ helping may provide, in our opinion, a theoretical framework that can help extend our general understanding of early socio-cognitive development and the complex interplay of multiple developmental processes."

Language mediated visual attention requires visual and linguistic information integration and has thus been used to examine properties of the architecture supporting multimodal processing during spoken language comprehension. In this paper we test predictions generated by alternative models of this multimodal system. A model (TRACE) in which multimodal information is combined at the point of the lexical representations of words generated predictions of a stronger effect of phonological rhyme relative to semantic and visual information on gaze behaviour, whereas a model in which sub-lexical information can interact across modalities (MIM) predicted a greater influence of visual and semantic information, compared to phonological rhyme. Two visual world experiments designed to test these predictions offer support for sub-lexical multimodal interaction during online language processing."

Two experiments continually measured spatial characteristics of ocular drift at central fixation during and after auditory number presentation. Consistent with the notion of a spatially oriented mental number line, we found spontaneous magnitude-dependent gaze adjustments, both with and without a concurrent saccadic task. This fixation adjustment (1) had a small-number/left-lateralized bias and (2) it was biphasic as it emerged for a short time around the point of lexical access and it received later robust representation around following number onset. This pattern suggests a two-step mechanism of sensorimotor mapping between numbers and space — a first-pass bottom-up activation followed by a top-down and more robust horizontal SNARC. Our results inform theories of number processing as well as simulation-based approaches to cognition by identifying the characteristics of an oculomotor resonance phenomenon."

The present experiments assessed the extent to which individual participants nevertheless adopt consistent strategies in these Bayesian reasoning problems, and investigated the nature of these strategies. In two experiments, one laboratory-based and one internet-based, each participant completed 36 problems with factorially manipulated probabilities. Many participants applied consistent strategies involving use of only one of the three probabilities provided in the problem, or additive combination of two of the probabilities. There was, however, substantial variability across participants in which probabilities were taken into account. In the laboratory experiment, participants’ eye movements were tracked as they read the problems. There was evidence of a relationship between information use and attention to a source of information. Participants’ self-assessments of their performance, however, revealed little confidence that the strategies they applied were actually correct. These results suggest that the hypothesis of base rate neglect actually underestimates people’s difficulty with Bayesian reasoning, but also suggest that participants are aware of their ignorance."

Previous studies confirmed beneficial short-term effects of metacognitive prompts on the learning process and on learning outcomes. However, the question of how stable these effects are for similar tasks in the future so far remains unanswered. Also, the use of online trace methods and the emergence of new analytical approaches allow deeper insights into the sequential structure of learning behavior. Therefore, we examined long-term effects of instructional support on sub-processes of self-regulated learning using Process Mining. Think-aloud protocols from 69 university students were measured during two hypermedia learning sessions about Educational Psychology. Metacognitive prompts supported the experimental group (n = 35) only during the first session. Based on a process model generated by using the data of the first learning task, we analysed the sustainability of effects during the second learning session. Results showed significant differences between the experimental and control group regarding the frequency of metacognitive strategies, which remain stable over time. Additionally, the application of Process Mining indicated which sequences of learning events were transferred to the second session. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of evaluating instructional support using analysis techniques that take into account the sequential structure of learning processes. While the results provide initial evidence for sustainable long-term effects on self-regulatory behavior, they have to be replicated in future research."

Artificial intelligence has recently attained humanlike performance in a number of gamelike domains. These advances have been spurred by brain-inspired architectures and algorithms such as hierarchical filtering and reinforcement learning. OpenAI Gym is an open-source platform in which to train, test, and benchmark algorithms—it provides a range of tasks, including those of classic arcade games such as Doom. Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions.
Methods
To illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n = 9, 22 ± 1 years of age) and older (n = 7, 56 ± 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward.
Results
These simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level–dependent responses can be produced.
Conclusions
We show that active inference, through epistemic and value-based goals, enables simulated subjects to actively develop detailed representations of gaming environments, and we demonstrate the use of a principled algorithmic and neurobiological framework for testing hypotheses in psychiatric illness."

Further, of the mental health disorders, AUD has the widest treatment gap. Thus, there is a critical need for improved understanding of the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of AUD. The application of cognitive science to the study of AUD has a longstanding history of attempting to meet this need. In this selective review, we identified and focused on four domains of recent (i.e., in the last decade) applications of cognitive science to the study of AUD: implicit cognitive biases, executive function, behavioral economic approaches to alcohol decision making, and functional connectivity neuroimaging. We highlighted advances within these four domains and considered them in the context of dual process models of addiction, which focus on the contribution and interplay of two complementary neurocognitive systems (impulsive and control systems). Findings across the domains were generally consistent with dual process models. They also suggest the need for further model refinements, including integrating behavioral economic approaches and findings from functional connectivity neuroimaging studies. Research evaluating candidate interventions associated with these domains is emergent but promising, suggesting important directions for future research."

The current research addresses the necessity to apply selective encoding as a requirement that goes beyond the ability to manage goals when solving figural matrices. In the first study (N = 38), we found that selective encoding demands are present in items with multiple rules in addition to goal management demands. Furthermore, eye movement data indicated that rule induction was hampered when selective encoding demands were present. The second study (N = 127) demonstrated that individuals' ability to filter relevant features in working memory was positively related to figural matrices items with selective encoding demands. Moreover, there was no evidence that other sources of WMC are related to goal management in figural matrices. Hence, this study provides preliminary evidence that filtering of relevant information in working memory is critical for solving figural matrices with multiple rules and challenges the view that goal management is the only driver of the relationship between WMC and performance in solving figural matrices with multiple rules."

Structural equation modeling analysis identified transfer of Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity to English reading comprehension. This transfer was realized through a direct pathway via English stress sensitivity and also an indirect pathway via English word reading. These results suggest that prosodic sensitivity is an important factor influencing English reading comprehension and that it needs to be incorporated into theoretical accounts of reading comprehension across languages."

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning, have led to high hopes regarding the possibilities of using automatic techniques to perform some of the tasks that are currently done manually using visualization by data analysts. However, visual analytics remains a complex activity, combining many different subtasks. Some of these tasks are relatively low-level, and it is clear how automation could play a role—for example, classification and clustering of data. Other tasks are much more abstract and require significant human creativity, for example, linking insights gleaned from a variety of disparate and heterogeneous data artifacts to build support for decision making. In this paper, we outline the potential applications of guidance, as well as the inputs to guidance. We discuss challenges in implementing guidance, including the inputs to guidance systems and how to provide guidance to users. We propose potential methods for evaluating the quality of guidance at different phases in the analytic process and introduce the potential negative effects of guidance as a source of bias in analytic decision making."

One significant puzzle in the study of linguistic comprehension is that the meaning communicated via language often goes beyond an aggregate of word meaning; comprehenders systematically derive pragmatic—as opposed to lexical or semantic—interpretations by leveraging their extralinguistic contextual knowledge. Key to this process is the insight that comprehenders compare what was said against what could have been said—the range of alternative messages and alternative utterances—to enrich their inferences about the speaker's intention behind a given choice of the linguistic signal. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework for investigating the roles of alternatives and how they are used in comprehension. The case studies we present span multiple levels, with the common thread that their surface forms fail to uniquely disambiguate the underlying meaning: turn-taking, disfluencies, intonational phonology, and pronoun resolution. We discuss Bayesian statistical inference as a possible computational-level approach to rationally combining assumptions about alternative forms and alternative meanings for pragmatic comprehension."

Traditionally, graphs are visualized to meet some pre-defined quality metrics, or aesthetics. It is commonly agreed that graphs that are drawn based on aesthetics are more likely to be not only beautiful but also comprehensible. However, those aesthetics were originally proposed by researchers based on their intuitions from a designer’s perspective. Although some of them have been empirically validated, to produce truly user cognitively friendly visualizations,well-grounded cognitive theories and design guidelines are needed. In this paper, we attempt to explore a cognitive approach that follows a user-centered process in visualizing graphs. We begin by proposing a graph visualization model, which is further conceptualized into a two-stage assessment cycle. It is argued that to provide effective cognitive support, it is essential to understand the cognitive process of a particular task in association with the attributes of the end user and the visual representation, and that to develop a set of design principles, what cognitive processes or graph reading strategies are involved should be part of evaluation. We materialized the model by reviewing the literature and providing relevant examples in the context of providing cognitive support and understanding cognitive process. We introduce theories from other disciplines such as perceptual and cognitive psychology, summarize methodologies that have been used in prior research, and discuss their implications for producing user-centered visualizations."

According to cognitive visuo-motor theory, the human eye movements are a rich source of information about the human intention and behavior. According to Beatty's study, a task-evoked pupillary response is a consistent index of the human cognitive load and attention. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a human's implicit intention recognition based on the eyeball movement pattern and pupil size variation. Based on the Bernard's research, we classify the human's implicit intention during a visual stimulus as informational and navigational intent. In the present study, the navigational intent refers to the human's idea to find some interesting objects in a visual input without a particular goal while the informational intent refers to the human's aspiration to find a particular object of interest. The proposed model utilizes the salient features of the eye such as fixation length, fixation count and pupil size variation as the inputs to classify the human's implicit intention. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve plausible recognition performance."

However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design.

abstract = "Anxiety is one of the most common clinical problems among children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet we know little about its etiology in the context of ASD. We posit that emotion regulation (ER) impairments are a risk factor for anxiety in ASD. Specifically, we propose that one reason why anxiety disorders are so frequently comorbid with ASD is because ER impairments are ubiquitous to ASD, stemming from socio-cognitive, physiological, and neurological processes related to impaired cognitive control, regulatory processes, and arousal. In this review, we offer a developmental model of how ER impairments may arise in ASD, and when (moderating influences) and how (meditational mechanisms) they result in anxiety."

We analyzed and compared the most representative symptoms with its neural model counterpart, detailing the alteration introduced in the network that generates each of the symptoms, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. We additionally cross-compared Bayesian and free-energy approaches, as they are widely applied to model psychiatric disorders and share basic mechanisms with neural networks. Models of schizophrenia mainly focused on hallucinations and delusional thoughts using neural dysconnections or inhibitory imbalance as the predominating alteration. Models of autism rather focused on perceptual difficulties, mainly excessive attention to environment details, implemented as excessive inhibitory connections or increased sensory precision. We found an excessively tight view of the psychopathologies around one specific and simplified effect, usually constrained to the technical idiosyncrasy of the used network architecture. Recent theories and evidence on sensorimotor integration and body perception combined with modern neural network architectures could offer a broader and novel spectrum to approach these psychopathologies. This review emphasizes the power of artificial neural networks for modeling some symptoms of neurological disorders but also calls for further developing of these techniques in the field of computational psychiatry."

The rich collection of literature on recommender systems, though, offers a great source to identify the key areas where these decisions need to be taken. In this paper, we survey existing literature with the aim of building a recommender system model inspired by Osterwalder’s canvas theory. The result of our semi-structured synthesis is a novel design approach in the form of a canvas for designing recommender systems. This work provides a better understanding and can serve as a guide for decision making in recommender system design."

In this article, we propose a neural model of EI to fill this need. This model incorporates recent insights from emotion theory, computational neuroscience, and large-scale network models of brain function. It also highlights several domain general processes – including those underlying conceptualization, automatic attention, habit formation, and cognitive control – that offer plausible targets for improving EI with training. Our model offers considerable promise in advancing understanding of intelligent emotional functioning and in guiding future neuroscience research on EI."

Choices of where to look are informed by perceptual judgments, which locate objects of current value or interest within the visual scene. This perceptual-motor transform is partly implemented in the frontal eye field (FEF), where visually responsive neurons appear to select behaviorally relevant visual targets and, subsequently, saccade-related neurons select the movements required to look at them. Here, we use urgent decision-making tasks to show (1) that FEF motor activity can direct accurate, visually informed choices in the complete absence of prior target-distracter discrimination by FEF visual responses and (2) that such discrimination by FEF visual cells shows an all-or-none reliance on the presence of stimulus attributes strongly associated with saliency-driven attentional allocation. The present findings suggest that FEF visual target selection is specific to visual judgments made on the basis of saliency and may not play a significant role in guiding saccadic choices informed solely by feature content."

Under some circumstances, production and comprehension are adjusted to a partner's perspective or characteristics in the early moments of processing, in a flexible and probabilistic fashion. We advocate studying the coordination and integration of cognitive products and processes both between and within the minds of interlocutors. We then discuss recent evidence from electrophysiology and imaging studies (relevant to Theory of Mind and to mirroring) that has begun to illuminate brain networks that underlie the coordination of joint and individual processing during communication."

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether drivers could be categorised into clusters according to their physiological responses to braking demands and whether the cluster type is related to deceleration intensity (in g units). Twenty-five drivers (males, aged 24–39) participated in a field experiment. We manipulated the braking demands using road signs to communicate the speed before braking (‘50’ or ‘60’) and the target speed for braking (‘30’ or ‘stop’). In an additional session, we asked drivers to brake intensively. We applied an advanced version of the k-means cluster analysis to the physiological data and adopted a two-physiological-cluster solution. Next, we calibrated an RM-ANOVA to estimate the effect of the physiological cluster and the braking demands on both the physiological indices and braking intensity. The results indicated that drivers could be assigned to one of the two clusters, mainly according to their heart rate and heart rate variability indices and less according to their skin conductance levels. However, the physiological cluster did not exert a significant effect on the actual deceleration intensity for any of the braking demands. These results indicate that different physiological responses to identical braking demands may result in similar performance outcomes. The practical implications of our observations might relate to the integration of physiological indices in driver support systems."

We observed robust evidence for expectancy influences on attention to birds, reflected in error rates, reaction times, pupil diameter, and heart rate (HR). We found no solid effect, however, of the same expectancies on attention to spiders; only HR revealed a weak and transient impact of prior expectancies on the orientation of attention to threat. Moreover, these asymmetric effects for spiders versus birds were observed in both phobics and controls. Our results are thus consistent with the notion of a threat detection mechanism that is only partially permeable to current expectancies, thereby increasing chances of survival in situations that are mistakenly perceived as safe."

According to an underspecification view, initial processing does not distinguish between the different senses. According to a Relevance Theory (RT)-inspired view, the context will immediately guide interpretation to a specific sense. In Experiment 1, participants indicated whether an adjective–noun construction made sense or not. Switching from one sense to another was costly, but there was no effect of sense frequency (contra SEL). In Experiment 2, eye movements were recorded when participants read sentences in which a polyseme was disambiguated to a specific sense following a neutral context, a sense was repeated, or a sense was switched. The results showed no effect of sense dominance in the neutral condition, no advantage when a sense was repeated, and a cost when switched, especially when switching from a concrete to an abstract interpretation. These data cannot be fitted in an SEL or RT-inspired account, questioning the validity of both as a processing account."

Though instructors can correct off-route gaze, a simply interpretable cue to listener knowledge, they habitually rely on inaccurate, underspecified verbal feedback instead and begin corrections without first checking the follower’s gaze. Time pressure discourages corrections accompanied by gaze checking. The results argue for shared responsibility attributable to a limitation in capacity to seek and integrate listener knowledge."

Obviously, this is a challenging cognition-based process, in which developers' cognition plays a key role. However, prior research has not explored developers' cognition during the process. The purpose of this study is to investigate and understand developers' cognitive representation styles and interaction patterns in agile requirements. A classification of developers' cognitive representation styles and interaction patterns was first proposed based on literature review. Then, an empirical research was conducted in a capstone software engineering course. Students were playing the role of developers and engaging in agile software development during this course, so their conversation about splitting and defining user stories was recorded and analyzed to examine developers' cognition via a content analysis method. The results show that, even when facing requirements analysis, developers tend to exhibit a technology-oriented cognitive representation style. Additionally, developers have more cognitive difficulty in determining activity and granularity than the role and business value of a user story. Developers also exhibit a preference for cognitive interaction pattern; assertion, comment, and two question-patterns are the major four patterns in our paper rather than information sharing, which was considered a major pattern in previous research. This paper contributes to our understanding of developers' cognition, further predicting and guiding developers' behaviors toward achieving good quality requirements analysis."

Here, we examined whether the magnitude of the exercise benefit is influenced by exercise intensity. Older adults (N = 17: mean age = 73 years) completed a volitional test to exhaustion (VO2peak) via treadmill to determine participant-specific moderate (80% of lactate threshold (LT)), heavy (15% of the difference between LT and VO2peak) and very-heavy (50% of the difference between LT and VO2peak) exercise intensities. Subsequently, in separate sessions all participants completed 10-min constant load single-bouts of exercise at each intensity. Pre- and post-exercise executive function were examined via the antisaccade task. Antisaccades require a saccade mirror-symmetrical to a target and extensive evidence has shown that antisaccades are supported via frontoparietal networks that demonstrate task-dependent changes following single-bout and chronic exercise. We also included a non-executive task (saccade to veridical target location; i.e., prosaccade) to determine whether a putative post-exercise benefit is specific to executive-related oculomotor control. Results showed that VO2 and psychological ratings of perceived exertion concurrently increased with increasing exercise intensity. As well, antisaccade reaction times showed a 24 ms (i.e., 8%) reduction from pre- to post-exercise assessments (p < .001), whereas prosaccade values did not (p = .19). Most notably, the post-exercise change in antisaccade RTs did not reliably vary with exercise intensity. Further, for each exercise intensity participants’ cardiorespiratory fitness level was unrelated to the magnitude of the post-exercise executive benefit (ps > .13). Accordingly, an exercise duration as brief as 10-min provides a selective benefit to executive function in older adults across the continuum of moderate to very-heavy intensities."

On the contrary, non-conventionally-coded pragmatic accounts predict exhaustivity to be more variable within a language, including cases where it can be cancelled, although (potentially) the inference will be more stable across languages. This article presents an original empirical perspective on the debate by looking both at the interpretative and the processing properties of English compared to French clefts. The combination of offline and online measures reported here show crucial and surprising differences within and across the two languages, findings which are unexpected under all current theories of clefts' meaning. We discuss a preliminary sketch for an analysis, which proposes that the differences between French and English are due to the way the existential presupposition derived from the cleft structure interacts with context (cf. Pollard and Yasavul, in press; De Veaugh-Geiss et al., 2018)."

This article presents a canonical process model from psychology and neuroscience, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), and shows that many RT phenomena in the economics literature are consistent with the predictions of the DDM.

In the present review, we examine the role affect-biased attention plays in shaping socioemotional trajectories within a developmental neuroscience framework. We propose that affect-biased attention, particularly if stable and entrenched, acts as a developmental tether that helps sustain early socioemotional and behavioral profiles over time, placing some individuals on maladaptive developmental trajectories. Although most of the evidence is found in the anxiety literature, we suggest that these relations may operate across multiple domains of interest, including positive affect, externalizing behaviors, drug use, and eating behaviors. We also review the general mechanisms and neural correlates of affect-biased attention, as well as the current evidence for the co-development of attention and affect. Based on the reviewed literature, we propose a model that may help us better understand the nuances of affect-biased attention across development. The model may serve as a strong foundation for ongoing attempts to identify neurocognitive mechanisms and intervene with individuals at risk. Finally, we discuss open issues for future research that may help bridge existing gaps in the literature."

The aim of this work was to assess how packaging cues and social norms influence product expectation, product perception, and ANS responses. Ninety-eight adults (age: 23.3±3.2years; BMI: 21.3±2.2kg/m2) first viewed four images of a yogurt package modified in hue (blue/red), brightness (high/low), and saturation (high/low) and two dummies alongside a fictitious product popularity score. After each image presentation, participants rated their expectations of the yogurt, tasted, and rated their perception of it. Expectations and the perception of liking, healthiness, sweetness, and flavour intensity were rated on 100-unit VAS scales. Heart rate (HR) and skin conductance response (SCR) to the image and tasting were measured. The darker, saturated red package elicited the lowest expectation of healthiness and the highest expectation of flavour intensity and sweetness. Red packages increased SCR while blue packages decreased them. During yogurt tasting, low product popularity was associated with a stronger decrease in SCR than a high popularity. Overall, the measured ANS responses were small. In conclusion, this study was the first to look at the effect of expectations elicited by a product’s packaging colour and popularity on explicit ratings and ANS responses. We found differences in SCR to package colour and product popularity, suggesting their importance in affecting consumer responses."

It is challenging for young learners to find the correct referent upon hearing an unknown word at the moment. This problem of referential uncertainty has been deemed as the crux of early word learning (Quine, 1960). Recent empirical and computational studies have found support for a statistical solution to the problem termed cross-situational learning. Cross-situational learning allows learners to acquire word meanings across multiple exposures, despite each individual exposure is referentially uncertain. Recent empirical research shows that infants, children and adults rely on cross-situational learning to learn new words (Smith & Yu, 2008; Suanda, Mugwanya, & Namy, 2014; Yu & Smith, 2007). However, researchers have found evidence supporting two very different theoretical accounts of learning mechanisms: Hypothesis Testing (Gleitman, Cassidy, Nappa, Papafragou, & Trueswell, 2005; Markman, 1992) and Associative Learning (Frank, Goodman, & Tenenbaum, 2009; Yu & Smith, 2007). Hypothesis Testing is generally characterized as a form of learning in which a coherent hypothesis regarding a specific word–object mapping is formed often in conceptually constrained ways. The hypothesis will then be either accepted or rejected with additional evidence. However, proponents of the Associative Learning framework often characterize learning as aggregating information over time through implicit associative mechanisms. A learner acquires the meaning of a word when the association between the word and the referent becomes relatively strong. In this chapter, we consider these two psychological theories in the context of cross-situational word-referent learning. By reviewing recent empirical and cognitive modeling studies, our goal is to deepen our understanding of the underlying word learning mechanisms by examining and comparing the two theoretical learning accounts."

This study was conducted to determine which abilities are central to explaining comprehension and which are secondary to other abilities. A battery of psycholinguistic and cognitive tests was administered to community college and university students. Seven constructs were identified: word decoding, working-memory capacity (WMC), general reasoning, verbal fluency, perceptual speed, inhibition, and language experience. Only general reasoning and language experience had direct effects; these two variables accounted for as much variance in comprehension as did the complete set. Direct effects of WMC and decoding were found only when general reasoning and language experience were deleted from the models. The authors question the need to include WMC in our theories of variability in adult reading comprehension and highlight the need to understand precisely how vocabulary facilitates comprehension."

abstract = "It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender’s expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability – even for differences between highly unpredictable words – and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension."

In the present study, we investigated whether a particular feature in their items—disambiguation using the pronoun ‘one’—could account for this discrepancy. The results of a corpus analysis and two on-line reading experiments showed that the presence of this pronoun is indeed responsible for the high attachment preference in the conjunction ambiguity. We conclude that for this syntactic ambiguity there is no discrepancy between on-line preferences and corpus frequencies. Consequently, there is no need to assume different processes underlying sentence comprehension and sentence production on the basis of the noun phrase conjunction ambiguity."

Viewed from such appraisal perspective, most accounts of affective attention predict that the appraisal of goal relevance (i.e. the overall relevance of a stimulus/event to one's current goals) should attract attention whereas some accounts also implicate the appraisal of goal congruence (i.e. the value of the stimulus with respect to these goals). We compared these accounts by investigating independent effects of goal relevance and goal congruence on attention capture operationalized through pupil dilation. Forty-seven participants completed a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID) where they sought to maximize the amount of chocolate received at the end of the experiment, pupil data from forty-two participants were used in the final analysis. Implicating attention capture by goal relevance, we found that pupil size was increased by all win- and loss-related compared to neutral stimuli and by materialized wins and losses compared to non-materialized ones. By contrast, we did not find pupil dilation effects of goal congruence across three different operationalizations of this appraisal dimension. These findings suggest that goal congruence appraisal may not contribute to the aspects of affective attention reflected in pupil dilation over and above goal relevance appraisal."

One characteristic concerns the function allocation (FA) between human and automation. Adverse effects of automation seem to be most likely when the human operator is taken out-of-the-loop from active decision-making, excessing a boundary from information automation to decision automation. The second characteristic is the reliability of automation. Previous research suggests a critical reliability boundary around 70% below which automation support cannot be considered as helpful. This study explored differential effects of crossing both boundaries at the same time. Within a multi-task simulation consisting of a monitoring task and two concurrent tasks, participants were assigned to one of six groups, two manual control groups and four automation-supported groups. Automation support differed with respect to FA (stage 1 vs stage 4 automation) and reliability (68.75% vs 87.5%), both factors varied across the critical boundaries. Results suggest that reliability determines human operators׳ attention allocation and performance. When reliability was below the boundary, participants showed an increased attentional effort and a worse performance compared to fairly reliable support. Against the stated assumptions, FA did not reveal any impact. In combination with previous research this result might indicate that the FA boundary might rather be some kind of “function allocation valley” concerning decision-making automation (stage 3) in which negative consequences for human operators are most likely. Results are discussed in the context of recent automation research."

Using a repetition priming paradigm in which long and variable lags were used to reduce the predictability of each repetition, we found that (i) repetition of words, but not pseudowords, evoked a differential bilateral frontal response in the 150–250ms window, (ii) a differential repetition N400m effect was observed between words and pseudowords. We argue that this frontal response, an MEG correlate of the P2 identified in ERP studies, reflects early access to long-term memory representations, which we tentatively characterize as being modality-specific."

Furthermore, we discuss the role of the multimodal, perceptuomotor, multiple-duty cells (mirror neurons) that play an important function in action anticipation by means of an inner motor simulation process. Finally, we suggest the role of predictive coding, interoception, and the enteric nervous system as the processual and biological support for intuition and “gut feelings” in sports—the missing link that might explain outstanding expert performance based on action anticipation."

The aim in this article is to review state-of-the-art approaches in video synopsis studies and provide a comprehensive analysis. The methodology of video synopsis is described to provide an overview on the flow of the algorithm. Recent literature is investigated into different aspects such as optimization type, camera topology, input data domain, and activity clustering mechanisms.

Disruption can be caused by changing auditory distractors (the changing-state effect) or by a sound that deviates from the auditory background (the deviation effect). The unitary account of auditory distraction explains both phenomena in terms of attentional capture whereas the duplex-mechanism account posits that they reflect two fundamentally different forms of distraction in which only the deviation effect is caused by attentional capture. To test these predictions, we exploited a physiological index of attention orienting: the pupillary dilation response (PDR). Participants performed visual serial recall while ignoring sequences of spoken letters. These sequences either comprised repeated or changing letters, and one letter could sometimes be replaced by pink noise (the deviant). Recall was poorer in both changing-state and deviant trials. Interestingly, the PDR was elicited by deviant sounds but not changing-state sounds, while a tonic increase in pupil size was found throughout changing-state trials. This physiological dissociation of the changing-state and the deviation effects suggests they are subtended by distinct mechanisms thereby procuring support for the duplex-mechanism account over the unitary account."

A group of high-school students (N = 94) learned about a biology topic through learner-paced multimedia instruction. Some of the learners received mental-animation prompts and others learned without prompts. A fine-grained analysis with spatial ability as continuous aptitude variable and mental animation as treatment showed a positive learning effect of animation prompts in learning outcomes of processes, but not in knowledge about structures. In addition, spatial ability only modified the relationship between animation prompts and learning when analyzing knowledge about processes. Specifically, only learners of low to medium spatial ability profited from the prompts while learners with very low or high spatial ability had comparable results when learning with or without prompts. In addition, only learners with high spatial ability rated their cognitive load to be significantly higher when learning with prompts. Results align with the assumptions of the production deficiency of learners with low to medium spatial ability, mediation deficiency of learners with very low spatial ability and stable learning performance of learners with high spatial ability whatever the learning situation offers."

The first experiment demonstrates the crucial role that an extra-retinal pursuit signal plays in the unambiguous perception of depth from motion parallax. The second experiment demonstrates that identical head movements can generate opposite depth percepts, and even ambiguous percepts, when the pursuit signal is altered. The pursuit theory of motion parallax provides a parsimonious explanation for all of these observations."

Four types of hostility biases can be distinguished: the hostile attribution, interpretation, expectation, and perception bias. Such low-level biases are believed to have a profound influence on decision-making, and possibly also increase the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts. The current review systematically examined extant research on the four types of hostility bias, with a particular focus on the associations between each type of hostility bias and aggressive behavior. The results confirmed the robust association between hostility biases and aggressive behavior. However, it is still unknown how exactly hostility biases are acquired. This is also caused by a tendency to study hostility biases separately, as if they are non-interacting phenomena. Another issue is that current approaches cannot directly quantify the latent cognitive processes pertaining to the hostility biases, thus creating an explanatory gap. To fill this gap, we embedded the results of the systematic review in a state-of-the-art computational framework, which provides a novel mechanistic account with testable predictions."

In contrast to this assumption, recent studies found that dwelling on distractors is longer in more inefficient search. Previous experiments in support of this contention all presented the same distractors across all conditions, while varying the targets. While this procedure has its virtues, it confounds the manipulation of search efficiency with target type. Here we use the same targets over the entire experiment, while varying search efficiency by presenting different types of distractors. Eye fixation behavior was used to infer the amount of distractor dwelling, skipping, and revisiting. The results replicate previous results, with similarity affecting dwelling, and dwelling in turn affecting search performance. A regression analysis confirmed that variations in dwelling account for a large amount of variance in search speed, and that the similarity effect in dwelling accounts for the similarity effect in overall search performance."

Further, to contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying deficient emotion recognition, we discussed the literature in light of specific emotion recognition theories. Current evidence from HD studies indicates deficits in the production of emotional facial expressions and alterations in subjective emotional experiences, in addition to emotion recognition deficits. Conceptual understanding of emotions remains relatively intact. Impaired recognition and expression of emotion in HD might be linked, whereas altered emotional experiences appear to be unrelated to emotion recognition. A key implication of this review is the need to take all the components of emotion processing into account to understand specific deficits in neurodegenerative diseases."

Firstly, because the influence of emotions on the human performance can be objectively assessed and predicted using standardized stimuli, secondly, because an emotion-sensitive computer system can be programmed to react adequately.

The proposed method assumes that the emotional state of the observer can distract his or her visual attention and can be reliably expressed in parameters of eye movements. We performed visual task experiments in order to record scanpaths from volunteers under auditory stress of controlled intensity. We used a calibrated set of stimuli and controlled the response of volunteers’ central nervous system expressed by the heart rate. For each efficiently stimulated participant, we related the scanpath parameters to the accuracy of solving a given task and to participant’s comment. As a principal result, we obtained a significant change of (1) saccade frequency in 90% and (2) maximum velocity in fixation phase in 80% of participants under stress. These results prove the influence of emotions on visual acuity, feasibility of eyetracking-based assessment of emotional state and motivate further investigations."

Here we examined the association of the early P1, N170 and late N1 component in visual event-related potentials (ERPs) with silent reading speed and a number of additional cognitive skills in a sample of 52 adult German readers utilizing a Lexical Decision Task (LDT) and a Face Decision Task (FDT). Amplitudes of the N170 component in the LDT but, interestingly, also in the FDT correlated with behavioral tests measuring silent reading speed. We suggest that reading speed performance can be at least partially accounted for by the extraction of essential structural information from visual stimuli, consisting of a domain-general and a domain-specific expertise-based portion."

Given the differences and diversity in the originating disciplines, it has been a challenge for educational neuroscience to integrate both theoretical and methodological perspectives in education and neuroscience in a coherent way. We present a multi-level framework for educational neuroscience, which argues for integration of multiple levels of analysis, some originating in brain and cognitive sciences, others in education, as a roadmap for the future of educational neuroscience, with concrete examples in mathematical learning and moral education."

Based on recent behavioral and neuroscientific findings, however, we argue for the more deeply rooted coordination of the mechanisms underlying visual and linguistic processing, and for jointly considering the behavioral and neural correlates of scene–sentence reconciliation during situated comprehension. The Coordinated Interplay Account (CIA; Knoeferle, P., & Crocker, M. W. (2007). The influence of recent scene events on spoken comprehension: Evidence from eye movements. Journal of Memory and Language, 57(4), 519–543) asserts that incremental linguistic interpretation actively directs attention in the visual environment, thereby increasing the salience of attended scene information for comprehension. We review behavioral and neuroscientific findings in support of the CIA’s three processing stages: (i) incremental sentence interpretation, (ii) language-mediated visual attention, and (iii) the on-line influence of non-linguistic visual context. We then describe a recently developed connectionist model which both embodies the central CIA proposals and has been successfully applied in modeling a range of behavioral findings from the visual world paradigm (Mayberry, M. R., Crocker, M. W., & Knoeferle, P. (2009). Learning to attend: A connectionist model of situated language comprehension. Cognitive Science). Results from a new simulation suggest the model also correlates with event-related brain potentials elicited by the immediate use of visual context for linguistic disambiguation (Knoeferle, P., Habets, B., Crocker, M. W., & Münte, T. F. (2008). Visual scenes trigger immediate syntactic reanalysis: Evidence from ERPs during situated spoken comprehension. Cerebral Cortex, 18(4), 789–795). Finally, we argue that the mechanisms underlying interpretation, visual attention, and scene apprehension are not only in close temporal synchronization, but have co-adapted to optimize real-time visual grounding of situated spoken language, thus facilitating the association of linguistic, visual and motor representations that emerge during the course of our embodied linguistic experience in the world."

The pupil dilation response (PDR) to violations has been associated with subcortical signals of arousal and prediction resetting. However, it is unclear how the context in which a deviant occurs affects the size of the PDR. Using ecological musical stimuli that we characterised using a computational model, we showed that the PDR to pitch deviants is sensitive to contextual uncertainty (quantified as entropy), whereby the PDR was greater in low than high entropy contexts. The PDR was also positively correlated with the unexpectedness of notes. No effects of music expertise were found, suggesting a ceiling effect due to enculturation. These results show that the same sudden environmental change can lead to differing arousal levels depending on contextual factors, providing evidence for a sensitivity of the PDR to long-term context."

The majority of DCEs use a matrix display with one row per attribute and one column per alternative. A comparison by alternatives implies that respondents process the choice task column-by-column. However, evidence from psychology and judgment and decision making research suggest that learned reading patterns dominate and as such the standard matrix display might induce processing by attributes rather than alternatives. We test this using a split sample survey conducted in France where respondents were randomly allocated into a standard or transposed matrix display group. Our results show that there is no difference in relative scale between the two groups, but that elicited preferences differ. Importantly, ASCs are insignificant in the transposed condition. We find no difference in propensity to use simplifying strategies, but respondents in the standard display condition are more likely to choose according to a random regret minimization (RRM) model rather than random utility model (RUM). We discuss the implications of our findings for future discrete choice experiments."

This review examined whether consumer nutrition knowledge is important for communication of nutrition information through labels on packaged foods. A cognitive processing model posits that consumers with prior knowledge are more likely to use label information effectively, that is, focus on salient information, understand information, and make healthful decisions based on this information. Consistent with this model, the review found that nutrition knowledge provides support for food label use. However, nutrition knowledge measures varied widely in terms of the dimensions they included and the extensiveness of the assessment. Relatively few studies investigated knowledge effects on the use of ingredient lists and claims, compared to nutrition facts labels. We also found an overreliance on convenience samples relying on younger adults, limiting our understanding of how knowledge supports food label use in later life. Future research should 1) investigate which dimensions, or forms, of nutrition knowledge are most critical to food label use and dietary decision making and 2) determine whether increases in nutrition knowledge can promote great use of nutrition information on food labels."

However, there is a lack of common references and structured protocols for the assessment of workers’ experience in industrial practices in an effective and predictive way. As a result, designers are poorly supported in the application of digital technologies, which are demonstrating to have a great potential. This ascertainment suggested defining a reference model to analyse the so-called user experience (UX) of workers and a proper technological set-up based on virtual simulations in order to support human-centred product-process design. Indeed, the recent advances in ubiquitous computing, wearable technologies and low-cost connected devices offer a huge amount of new tools for human data monitoring. However, the open issue is selecting the most proper devices for industrial application area in respect with design goals, using virtual simulation and digital manufacturing tools. The research proposed a structured procedure to use existing digital technologies to support product-process design to analyse the workers behaviours and assess the perceived experience for industrial scopes. The paper defined a structured protocol analysis to objectify and measure the workers’ experience with the final aim to support the requirements definition in product-process design by using digital technologies. In particular, the model has been defined for the automotive sector. The paper contribution is the definition of the protocol analysis and the development of a mixed reality (MR) set-up to involve real users’ and to improve the digital models. Such a protocol has been applied to different industrial cases related to product and process design, developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial. The comparison with traditional design procedures highlighted the benefits of adopting virtual mock-up and digital simulation within a MR environment to shorten design time and improve the design overall quality."

abstract = "Human eye-to-eye contact is a primary source of social cues and communication. In spite of the biological significance of this interpersonal interaction, the underlying neural processes are not well-understood. This knowledge gap, in part, reflects limitations of conventional neuroimaging methods, including solitary confinement in the bore of a scanner and minimal tolerance of head movement that constrain investigations of natural, two-person interactions. However, these limitations are substantially resolved by recent technical developments in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive spectral absorbance technique that detects changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain by using surface-mounted optical sensors. Functional NIRS is tolerant of limited head motion and enables simultaneous acquisitions of neural signals from two interacting partners in natural conditions. We employ fNIRS to advance a data-driven theoretical framework for two-person neuroscience motivated by the Interactive Brain Hypothesis which proposes that interpersonal interaction between individuals evokes neural mechanisms not engaged during solo, non-interactive, behaviors. Within this context, two specific hypotheses related to eye-to-eye contact, functional specificity and functional synchrony, were tested. The functional specificity hypothesis proposes that eye-to-eye contact engages specialized, within-brain, neural systems; and the functional synchrony hypothesis proposes that eye-to-eye contact engages specialized, across-brain, neural processors that are synchronized between dyads. Signals acquired during eye-to-eye contact between partners (interactive condition) were compared to signals acquired during mutual gaze at the eyes of a picture-face (non-interactive condition). In accordance with the specificity hypothesis, responses during eye-to-eye contact were greater than eye-to-picture gaze for a left frontal cluster that included pars opercularis (associated with canonical language production functions known as Broca's region), pre- and supplementary motor cortices (associated with articulatory systems), as well as the subcentral area. This frontal cluster was also functionally connected to a cluster located in the left superior temporal gyrus (associated with canonical language receptive functions known as Wernicke's region), primary somatosensory cortex, and the subcentral area. In accordance with the functional synchrony hypothesis, cross-brain coherence during eye-to-eye contact relative to eye-to-picture gaze increased for signals originating within left superior temporal, middle temporal, and supramarginal gyri as well as the pre- and supplementary motor cortices of both interacting brains. These synchronous cross-brain regions are also associated with known language functions, and were partner-specific (i.e., disappeared with randomly assigned partners). Together, both within and across-brain neural correlates of eye-to-eye contact included components of previously established productive and receptive language systems. These findings reveal a left frontal, temporal, and parietal long-range network that mediates neural responses during eye-to-eye contact between dyads, and advance insight into elemental mechanisms of social and interpersonal interactions."

The primary empirical test of this notion is the search for effects from upcoming words on readers’ eye movements during sentence reading. Here we argue that no conclusions can be drawn from the absence of such effects, and that the serial versus parallel processing debate cannot be resolved without treading beyond the methodological scope of tracking eye movements. Recent considerations of how the brain organizes linguistic input have sparked key predictions in- and outside the realm of text reading, with ensuing research revealing phenomena that complicate the serial processing perspective. A case is made for parallelism, along with new methods to infer the cognitive architecture driving reading."

One of the key features in interactive data visualization is that users have direct control over how information is presented during the decision-making process. Few studies have examined how users choose visualization formats in such an environment. In this study, we investigate how cognitive style, spatial ability, and task difficulty affect the preference and choice of visualization formats and how the chosen visualization format in turn affects decision accuracy and confidence. Our results show that the choice of visualization format is affected by a user's cognitive style and task difficulty. While decision performances in accuracy and confidence are affected by task difficulty, spatial ability, and visualization format, they are largely not affected by the interactions between visualization format and cognitive style, spatial ability, and task difficulty."
