Neuro-imaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), provide a novel neuro-cognitive perspective to program-comprehension research. With my thesis work, we aim at establishing fMRI as a new tool for program-comprehension and software-engineering studies. Furthermore, we seek to refine our existing framework for conducting fMRI studies by extending it with eye tracking and improved control conditions. We describe how we will apply our upgraded framework to extend our understanding of program comprehension.

Such an ""attentional"" system in the visual domain is believed to be involved in both the perception of objects and the control of eye movements in primates. While we can intentionally guide our attention to perform a specific task, it is also reflexively drawn to ""salient"" features in our sensory input space. Understanding how high-level task information and lour-level stimulus information can combine to control our sensory processing is of great interest to both neuroscience and engineering. Towards this end, we have designed and fabricated a one-dimensional, analog VLSI vision chip that models covert attentional search and tracking. We extend previous analog VLSI work (Morris and DeWeerth, 1997) on the delayed onset of inhibition in a winner-take-all network to now use extracted image edges as input to the attentional saliency map and to perform serial search on a particular feature conjunction (spatial derivative and the direction-of-motion).

For information systems (IS) projects that require professionals from multiple disciplines to work together, the use of indirect communication may hinder successful design, implementation, and maintenance of these systems. Drawing on the Speech Act Theory (SAT), this study investigates how direct and indirect speech acts may influence language comprehension in the setting of communication problems inherent in IS projects. Research questions: (1) Do participating subjects, who are IS professionals, differ in their comprehension of indirect and direct speech acts? (2) Do participants display different attention processes in their comprehension of indirect and direct speech acts? (3) Do participants' attention processes influence their comprehension of indirect and direct speech acts? Literature review: We review two relevant areas of theory-polite speech acts in professional communication and SAT. First, a broad review that focuses on literature related to the use of polite speech acts in the workplace and in information system (IS) projects suggests the importance of investigating speech acts by professionals. In addition, the SAT provides the theoretical framework guiding this study and the development of hypotheses. Methodology: The current study uses a quantitative approach. A between-groups experiment design was employed to test how direct and indirect speech acts influence the language comprehension of participants. Forty-three IS professionals participated in the experiment. In addition, through the use of eye-tracking technology, this study captured the attention process and analyzed the relationship between attention and comprehension. Results and discussion: The results show that the directness of speech acts significantly influences participants' attention process, which, in turn, significantly affects their comprehension. In addition, the findings indicate that indirect speech acts, if employed by IS professionals to communicate with others, may easily be distorted or misunderstood. Professionals and managers of organizations should be aware that effective communication in interdisciplinary projects, such as IS development, is not easy, and that reliance on polite or indirect communication may inhibit the generation of valid information.","","","10.1109/TPC.2013.2263648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525431","Communication;direct/indirect speech act;eye movement;information system (IS) project;Speech Act Theory (SAT)","Information systems;Speech processing;Indirect speech;Direct speech;Project management","business communication;information systems;linguistics;organisational aspects;professional communication","attention-comprehension relationship analysis;eye-tracking technology;quantitative approach;information system projects;workplace;SAT;professional communication;polite speech acts;attention processes;IS professionals;IS projects;language comprehension;speech act theory;business communication;indirect communication;project communication;direct speech act comprehension;indirect speech act comprehension;information system professionals","","7","84","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By elaborately annotating three popular video segmentation datasets (DAVIS16, Youtube-Objects and SegTrackV2) with dynamic eye-tracking data in the unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) setting, for the first time, we quantitatively verified the high consistency of visual attention behavior among human observers, and found strong correlation between human attention and explicit primary object judgments during dynamic, task-driven viewing. Such novel observations provide an in-depth insight of the underlying rationale behind video object pattens. Inspired by these findings, we decouple UVOS into two sub-tasks: UVOS-driven Dynamic Visual Attention Prediction (DVAP) in spatiotemporal domain, and Attention-Guided Object Segmentation (AGOS) in spatial domain. Our UVOS solution enjoys three major advantages: 1) modular training without using expensive video segmentation annotations, instead, using more affordable dynamic fixation data to train the initial video attention module and using existing fixation-segmentation paired static/image data to train the subsequent segmentation module; 2) comprehensive foreground understanding through multi-source learning; and 3) additional interpretability from the biologically-inspired and assessable attention. Experiments on four popular benchmarks show that, even without using expensive video object mask annotations, our model achieves compelling performance compared with state-of-the-arts and enjoys fast processing speed (10 fps on a single GPU).

However, these approaches are still struggling when it comes to managing the quality of their models. Problems in quality can cause difficulties in anaging and understanding requirements, which in turn leads to increased development costs. The models' quality should then be a permanent concern. We propose a quantitative assessment of the goal-oriented and scenario-based models' quality, namely its complexity, completeness, appropriateness recognizability, understandability and learnability. To this end, we propose a combination of techniques to be applied to the RE models, the modelling process, and the models' notation. We are going to define metrics about the models, through the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach, and incorporate them in a common evaluation framework that helps in the requirements modelling process. The quality of the RE models, the modelling process and the model's notation will be measured by collecting biometric data from stakeholders, by using eye-tracking devices, electroencephalography (EEG) scanners, and electro-dermal activity (EDA) scanners. Furthermore, we will collect metrics about the model during the modelling process, and the subjective opinion of stakeholders about the usage of these models, through questionnaires like NASA TLX [4] (which measures perceived effort while working on tasks). All metrics and biometrics are going to be theoretically and experimentally evaluated, through a set of case studies and experiments with different types of participants (including researchers, practitioners and students).","","","10.1109/RE.2016.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765561","requirements models;quality evaluation;metrics;biometrics","Biological system modeling;Brain models;Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Measurement;Stakeholders","biometrics (access control);formal specification;formal verification","requirements models evaluation;requirements engineering;models notation;goal-question-metric approach;GQM approach;requirements modelling process;eye-tracking devices;electroencephalography;EEG scanners;electro-dermal activity;EDA scanners;biometrics","","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, relatively less effort has been spent in understanding visual attention over dynamic scenes. This work makes three contributions to video saliency research. First, we introduce a new benchmark, called DHF1K, for predicting fixations during dynamic scene free-viewing, which is a long-time need in this field. DHF1K consists of 1K high-quality, elaborately selected videos annotated by 17 observers using an eye tracker. The videos span a wide range of scenes, motions, object types and backgrounds. Second, we propose a novel video saliency model, called ACLNet, that augments the CNN-LSTM network with a supervised attention mechanism to enable fast end-to-end learning. The attention mechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information, thus allowing LSTM to focus on learning a more flexible temporal saliency representation. Such a design leverages existing large-scale static fixation datasets, avoids overfitting, and significantly improves training efficiency and testing performance. Third, we perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art saliency models on three current datasets (i.e., DHF1K, Hollywood2, UCF sports). Experimental results over more than 1.2K testing videos containing 400K frames demonstrate that ACLNet outperforms other contenders and has a fast processing speed (40fps).","","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2924417","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8744328","Video saliency;dynamic visual attention prediction;benchmark;deep learning","Visualization;Benchmark testing;Sports;Predictive models;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Task analysis","","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the impressive capability of visual saliency in predicting human visual attention that is closely related to the query intention, this paper attempts to explicitly discover the essential effect of visual saliency in CBIR via qualitative and quantitative experiments. Toward this end, we first generate the fixation density maps of images from a widely used CBIR dataset by using an eye-tracking apparatus. These ground-truth saliency maps are then used to measure the influence of visual saliency to the task of CBIR by exploring several probable ways of incorporating such saliency cues into the retrieval process. We find that visual saliency is indeed beneficial to the CBIR task, and the best saliency involving scheme is possibly different for different image retrieval models. Inspired by the findings, this paper presents two-stream attentive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with saliency embedded inside for CBIR. The proposed network has two streams that simultaneously handle two tasks. The main stream focuses on extracting discriminative visual features that are tightly related to semantic attributes. Meanwhile, the auxiliary stream aims to facilitate the main stream by redirecting the feature extraction to the salient image content that a human may pay attention to. By fusing these two streams into the Main and Auxiliary CNNs (MAC), image similarity can be computed as the human being does by reserving conspicuous content and suppressing irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves impressive performance in image retrieval on four public datasets.","","","10.1109/TIP.2019.2913513","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Nova Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8704995","Visual saliency;content-based image retrieval;bag-of-word;convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Visualization;Semantics;Streaming media;Task analysis;Reliability","content-based retrieval;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;gaze tracking;image fusion;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","eye-tracking apparatus;MAC;main and auxiliary CNN;discriminative visual feature extraction;CBIR;CNN;two-stream attentive convolutional neural networks;ground-truth saliency maps;human visual attention;visual saliency;human query intention;content-based image retrieval;saliency inside;image similarity;salient image content","","","78","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast with text, graphical representations are presented in two-dimensional form, which seems easy to process. However, few empirical studies investigated the efficiency of graphical representations vs. textual ones in modelling and presenting software requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we report the results of an eye-tracking experiment involving 28 participants to study the impact of structured textual vs. graphical representations on subjects' efficiency while performing requirement comprehension tasks. We measure subjects' efficiency in terms of the percentage of correct answers (accuracy) and of the time and effort spend to perform the tasks. We observe no statistically-significant difference in term of accuracy. However, our subjects spent more time and effort while working with the graphical representation although this extra time and effort does not affect accuracy. Our findings challenge the general assumption that graphical representations are more efficient than the textual ones at least in the case of developers not familiar with the graphical representation. Indeed, our results emphasise that training can significantly improve the efficiency of our subjects working with graphical representations. Moreover, by comparing the visual paths of our subjects, we observe that the spatial structure of the graphical representation leads our subjects to follow two different strategies (top-down vs. bottomup) and subsequently this hierarchical structure helps developers to ease the difficulty of model comprehension tasks.","","","10.1109/ICPC.2013.6613831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613831","Graphical representation;Textual representation;Eye-tracking study;Visual path","Visualization;Accuracy;Software;Unified modeling language;Pragmatics;Monitoring;Time measurement","data visualisation;formal specification","graphical representation;textual representation;software requirements comprehension;software development process;visual path;spatial structure;eye-tracking study;software artifacts","","17","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed model, a multi-scale transform is used to obtain the original image at different scales, and the local contrast features of intensity, texture and color are calculated at each scale. Then these contrast features are interpolated iteratively to form three feature maps corresponding to intensity, texture and color respectively. Finally, the feature maps are integrated to obtain the final salient regions.

Eye tracking models offer clues for implementing artificial vision on robots, to give salient information for marketing, for art, or forensic research. If the task might be relatively simple for following one precise target in an image, the issues are more complicated when more objects have to be identified, in a multitask perception simulation. Another aspect is to take into consideration the semantic content and this depends on the detailed, rule-frames, formulation of the problem.

This paper proposes an automatic gaze prediction algorithm by modeling such function. An improved foveal imaging model is developed by taking visual attention and temporal visual characteristics into account. Gaze changes are predicted based on minimizing perceptual information loss due to the foveated vision mechanism. Experimental results against a video eye-tracking database demonstrate a promising performance of the proposed gaze prediction algorithm.","","","10.1109/ICME.2012.191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298440","eye movement;foveal imaging;gaze detection;perceptual information loss;visual attention","Visualization;Predictive models;Sensitivity;Retina;Observers;Loss measurement;Brain modeling","video signal processing","video gaze prediction;perceptual information loss;automatic detection;gaze points;human visual system;HVS;natural function;foveal imaging model;foveated vision mechanism;video eye-tracking database","","4","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The possibility of using eye tracking in a mobile gadget is a challenging objective that would permit to spread this technology to non-explored fields. In this paper, a knowledge based approach is presented to solve gaze estimation in low resolution settings. The understanding of the high resolution paradigm permits to propose alternative models to solve gaze estimation. In this manner, three models are presented: a geometrical model, an interpolation model and a compound model, as solutions for gaze estimation for remote low resolution systems. Since this work considers head position essential to improve gaze accuracy, a method for head pose estimation is also proposed. The methods are validated in an optimal framework, I2Head database, which combines head and gaze data. The experimental validation of the models demonstrates their sensitivity to image processing inaccuracies, critical in the case of the geometrical model. Static and extreme movement scenarios are analyzed showing the higher robustness of compound and geometrical models in the presence of user’s displacement. Accuracy values of about 3° have been obtained, increasing to values close to 5° in extreme displacement settings, results fully comparable with the state-of-the-art.","","","10.1109/TIP.2019.2946452","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876860","Gaze estimation methods;low resolution;eye tracking","Estimation;Head;Image resolution;Gaze tracking;Databases;Cameras","","","","","41","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Look around you: Saliency maps for omnidirectional images in VR applications","A. De Abreu; C. Ozcinar; A. Smolic","Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","2017 Ninth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","","2017","","","1","6","Understanding visual attention has always been a topic of great interest in the graphics, image/video processing, robotics and human-computer interaction communities. By understanding salient image regions, the compression, transmission and rendering algorithms can be optimized. This is particularly important in omnidirectional images (ODIs) viewed with a head-mounted display (HMD), where only a fraction of the captured scene is displayed at a time, namely viewport. In order to predict salient image regions, saliency maps are estimated either by using an eye tracker to collect eye fixations during subjective tests or by using computational models of visual attention. However, eye tracking developments for ODIs are still in the early stages and although a large list of saliency models are available, no particular attention has been dedicated to ODIs. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the problem of estimating saliency maps for ODIs viewed with HMDs, when the use of an eye tracker device is not possible. We collected viewport center trajectories (VCTs) of 32 participants for 21 ODIs and propose a method to transform the gathered data into saliency maps. The obtained saliency maps are compared in terms of image exposition time used to display each ODI in the subjective tests. Then, motivated by the equator bias tendency in ODIs, we propose a post-processing method, namely fused saliency maps (FSM), to adapt current saliency models to ODIs requirements. We show that the use of FSM on current models improves their performance by up to 20%. The developed database and testbed are publicly available with this paper.","","","10.1109/QoMEX.2017.7965634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965634","Fixations;head-mounted display (HMD);omnidirectional images (ODIs);saliency maps;viewport;virtual reality (VR)","Visualization;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Resists;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Trajectory","data compression;helmet mounted displays;image coding;image representation;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","omnidirectional images;VR applications;graphics;image processing;video processing;robotics;human-computer interaction;salient image regions;compression algorithms;transmission algorithms;rendering algorithms;head-mounted display;HMD;eye tracker;eye fixations;viewport center trajectories;VCTs;image exposition time;fused saliency maps;FSM;ODI representation","","19","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analog very large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronic circuit technology provides such an enabling technology. We here describe a neuromorphic system that is part of a long-term effort to understand the primate oculomotor system. It requires both fast sensory processing and fast motor control to interact with the world. A one-dimensional hardware model of the primate eye has been built that simulates the physical dynamics of the biological system. It is driven by two different analog VLSI chips, one mimicking cortical visual processing for target selection and tracking and another modeling brain stem circuits that drive the eye muscles. Our oculomotor plant demonstrates both smooth pursuit movements, driven by a retinal velocity error signal, and saccadic eye movements, controlled by retinal position error, and can reproduce several behavioral, stimulation, lesion, and adaptation experiments performed on primates.","","","10.1162/089976699300016908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790604","","","","","","7","","","","","","MITP",""

Previous research suggested layout quality, diagram size, and expertise level are relevant impact factors on understanding, while diagram type is not. Surprisingly little is known about how diagrams are read. Objective: Eventually, we want to understand the cognitive processes of diagram and model understanding. In this paper, we study the behavior of modelers while reading UML diagrams in terms of reading strategies and how they affect diagram understanding. Method: We conduct an eye tracking study with 28 participants, reusing diagrams and items from previous experiments. We record several objective and subjective performance indicators as well as eye movement and pupil dilation. Results: We discover behavioral regularities and aggregate them into reading strategies which vary with expertise level and diagram type, but not with layout quality. Conclusions: Modelers exhibit specific strategies of diagram understanding. Experts employ different strategies than novices, which explains performance differences irrespective of layout quality.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449594","","Unified modeling language;Layout;Gaze tracking;Visualization;Software engineering;Software;Trajectory","cognition;eye;Unified Modeling Language","behavioral regularity;cognitive process;eye-tracking;pupil dilation;eye movement;diagram understanding;model understanding;expertise level;diagram size;Conceptual diagrams;UML diagrams;modelers;layout quality","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Dragonfly preying on flying insects, rendezvous search games, and rendezvous and docking in space explorations","Z. Ma","Computer Science Department, University of Idaho, Moscow, 83844, USA","2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","","2009","","","1","8","Dragonfly adults are predatory, and they demonstrate extraordinary capability to prey on flying insects. Significant understanding of this dragonfly behavior has been achieved in last 3 decades. Some species of dragonflies are the so-called ldquoperchersrdquo because they sit-and-wait for preys. Some other species of dragonflies are the so-called ldquohawkersrdquo who forage in flight by swooping up to grab prey insects passing overhead (Olberg et al. 1980, 2007). According to Olberg et al. (2000, 2005), this exceptional feat in intercepting and capturing prey insects (with as high as 97% success) are guided by their large compound eyes (each eye may consists of as many as 28000 facets). This amazingly versatile behavior can be abstracted as three interdependent processes: (1) decision to take off and initiate the pursuit; (2) navigating to intercept the prey; (3) coordinating leg movements in space and time to grab the prey. Although the exact mechanisms is still not well understood, it is clear that dragonflies are able to accurately estimate the distance from the passing object, over surprising long ranges, to make take-off decision in pursuit of a flying prey. In this paper, the author first reviews the state-of-the-art research on this extraordinary feat of the dragonfly and then explore the potential to harness it for precise rendezvous and docking in space explorations. To achieve the objective, the first necessary step is to capture the behavior process with realistic and ideally precise mathematical models. However, it appears that the existing object tracking algorithms alone may be insufficient for the modeling task. The author suggests that the search game (SG), rendezvous search game (RSG), and rendezvous search game with evasion are applied to capture the behavior process, particularly, the cognitive decision-making process. Finally, the author proposes a two-layer modeling architecture in which SG/RSG are used at the strategic level and the traditional object tracking algorithms at the tactical level.","","","10.1109/AERO.2009.4839576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839576","","Insects;Space exploration;Game theory;Animals;Aerodynamics;Space technology;Computer science;Eyes;Navigation;Leg","aerospace computing;cognition;decision making;object detection","dragonfly preying;flying insect;rendezvous search game;rendezvous and docking;space exploration;dragonfly behavior;behavior process;mathematical model;object tracking;cognitive decision-making;modeling architecture;tactical level","","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Keynote - The ABCs of Software Engineering: Affect, Biometrics, and Cognition","A. Begel","Microsoft Research, USA","2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)","","2017","","","xxi","xxi","Summary for only given, as follows. Researchers have long investigated how people read, write, and speak about software on their computers to identify the skills, education, and practices needed need to acquire expertise and perform development duties effectively and efficiently. However, until now the methods used to study developer comprehension, expression, and communication has been limited and coarse-grained because there was no way to identify what a developer thought or felt unless it was expressed out loud. The world has changed. With the introduction of low-cost, widely available, high-fidelity biometric sensors, we can now more directly observe a software developer's cognitive and affective (emotional) processes. The ABCs of Software Engineering is a set of techniques that modernize classic approaches to program comprehension and human interaction by combining (A) principles governing the influence of human *affect* on behavior, (B) *biometric* sensors, and (C) models of *cognition* informed by advances in cognitive neuroscience. Technologies like electroencephalography (EEG), electro-dermal activity sensors (EDA), capacitive sensors, and eye trackers can reveal a software developer's internal emotional states, for example identifying when the developer is confused, frustrated, surprised, stressed, fatigued, or in a highly productive flow state. These affective states can be correlated with code quality, software complexity, development productivity, and effective communication - the same software outcomes already correlated with developer activities in other research areas such as mining software repositories (MSR) and cooperative and human aspects of software engineering (CHASE). By developing a better understanding of what programmers think and feel when they create and maintain software, we can design tools and interventions to improve their productivity and reduce the impact of their errors.","","","10.1109/ICPC.2017.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961497","","","human factors;software engineering","software engineering;affect;biometrics;cognition;developer comprehension;developer expression;developer communication;code quality;software complexity;development productivity;effective communication;mining software repositories;MSR;cooperative aspect;human aspect","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
