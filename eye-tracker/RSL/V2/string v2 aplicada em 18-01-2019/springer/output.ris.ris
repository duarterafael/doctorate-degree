AB  - Business process models constitute fundamental artifacts for enterprise architectures as well as for the engineering of processes and information systems. However, less experienced stakeholders (i.e., novices) face a wide range of issues when trying to read and comprehend these models. In particular, process model comprehension not only requires knowledge on process modeling notations, but also skills to visually and correctly interpret the models. In this context, many unresolved issues concerning the factors hindering process model comprehension exist and, hence, the identification of these factors becomes crucial. Using eye-tracking as an instrument, this paper presents the results obtained of a study, in which we analyzed eye-movements of novices and experts, while comprehending process models expressed in terms of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. Further, recorded eye-movements are visualized as scan paths to analyze the applied comprehension strategies. We learned that experts comprehend process models more effectively than novices. In addition, we observed particular patterns for eye-movements (e.g., back-and-forth saccade jumps) as well as different strategies of novices and experts in comprehending process models.

TI  - Understanding Process Models Using the Eye-Tracking: A Systematic Mapping
BT  - Quality of Information and Communications Technology
SP  - 89

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Business process modeling can involve multiple stakeholders, so it is natural that problems may occur in building and understanding them. One way to perceive these problems is to evaluate the comprehension of these models through the collection of data related to the readers’ awareness with an eye-tracking device. This device allows collecting data of specific facial reactions of the people, such as the movement of the eyes and dilation of the pupils and the number of blinks in a specified time interval. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of researches that evaluate the understanding of process models through eye-tracking techniques. A systematic mapping study was developed to achieve this goal, following the best practices in the area of Software Engineering. This study consolidated 19 papers for the analysis and extraction of data from the 1,161 studies initially found.

SP  - 137
EP  - 152
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Process modeling constitutes a fundamental task in the context of process-aware information systems. Besides process model creation, the reading and understanding of process models is of utmost importance. To better understand the latter, we have developed a conceptual framework focusing on the comprehension of business process models. By adopting concepts from cognitive neuroscience and psychology, the paper presents initial results from a series of eye tracking experiments on process model comprehension. The results indicate that experiences with process modeling have an influence on overall model comprehension. In turn, with increasing process model complexity, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling do not significantly differ with respect to process model comprehension. The results further indicate that both groups face similar challenges in reading and comprehending process models. The conceptual framework takes these results into account and provides the basis for the further experiments.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Research on the process of process modeling (PPM) studies how process models are created. It typically uses the logs of the interactions with the modeling tool to assess the modeler’s behavior. In this paper we suggest to introduce an additional stream of data (i.e., eye tracking) to improve the analysis of the PPM. We show that, by exploiting this additional source of information, we can refine the detection of comprehension phases (introducing activities such as “semantic validation” or “problem understanding”) as well as provide more exploratory visualizations (e.g., combined modeling phase diagram, heat maps, fixations distributions) both static and dynamic (i.e., movies with the evolution of the model and eye tracking data on top).

AB  - Visual process models are meant to facilitate comprehension of business processes. However, in practice, process models can be difficult to understand. The main goal of this article is to clarify the sources of cognitive effort in comprehending process models. The article undertakes a comprehensive descriptive review of empirical and theoretical work in order to categorize and summarize systematically existing findings on the factors that influence comprehension of visual process models. Methodologically, the article builds on a review of forty empirical studies that measure objective comprehension of process models, seven studies that measure subjective comprehension and user preferences, and thirty-two articles that discuss the factors that influence the comprehension of process models. The article provides information systems researchers with an overview of the empirical state of the art of process model comprehension and provides recommendations for new research questions to be addressed and methods to be used in future experiments.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Understanding business process models has been previously related to various factors. Those factors were determined using statistical approaches either on model repositories or on experiments based on comprehension questions. We noticed that, when asking comprehension questions on a process model, usually the expert explores only a part of the entire model to provide the answer. This paper formalizes this observation under the notion of Relevant Region. We conduct an experiment using eye-tracking to prove that the Relevant Region is indeed correlated to the answer given to the comprehension question. We also give evidence that it is possible to predict whether the correct answer will be given to a comprehension question, knowing the number and the time spent fixating Relevant Region elements. This paper sets the foundations for future improvements on model comprehension research and practice.

CY  - Cham
AB  - For documenting business processes, there exists a plethora of process modeling languages. In this context, graphical process models are used to enhance the process comprehensibility of the stakeholders involved. The large number of available modeling languages, however, aggravates process model comprehension and increases the knowledge gap between domain and modeling experts. Upon this, one major challenge is to identify factors fostering the comprehension of process models. This paper discusses the experiences we gathered with the use of eye tracking in experiments on process model comprehension and the lessons learned in this context. The objective of the experiments was to study the comprehension of process models expressed in terms of four different modeling languages (i.e., BPMN, eGantt, EPC, and Petri Net). This paper further provides recommendations along nine identified categories that can foster related experiments on process model comprehension.

AB  - Modeling landscapes in organizations suffer from the problem of information silos, where a number of process models, business rule repositories and other information artefacts may exist concurrently for the same business activity. In this paper, we investigate integrating business process models and business rules. Prior literature presents three such approaches, namely text annotation, diagrammatic, and link integration. We evaluate these approaches from a cognitive load perspective and measure the value of integration from three perspectives: understanding accuracy, mental effort and time efficiency. Our results indicate that diagrammatic integration is associated with better understanding accuracy than text annotation and link integration, but may require more mental effort and time under certain conditions. We also found that the integration approach partially influences mental effort and time efficiency. Further insights from our empirical analysis reveal relationships between process model constructs, integration approaches and cognitive load, especially how approaches applied to models with specific characteristics, impact on process understanding and cognitive load.

AB  - Research investigating cognitive aspects of information systems is often dependent on detail–rich data. Eye–trackers promise to provide respective data, but the associated costs are often beyond the researchers’ budget. Recently, eye–trackers have entered the market that promise eye–tracking support at a reasonable price. In this work, we explore whether such eye–trackers are of use for information systems research and explore the accuracy of a low–cost eye–tracker (Gazepoint GP3) in an empirical study. The results show that Gazepoint GP3 is well suited for respective research, given that experimental material acknowledges the limits of the eye–tracker. To foster replication and comparison of results, all data, experimental material as well as the source code developed for this study are made available online.

AB  - In this chapter, we develop hypotheses that rule linking can improve process model understanding accuracy, time efficiency, and reduce mental effort. Then we present our experiment investigating the effect of rule linking, a specific rule integration approach which uses graphical links to connect process model symbols with rules, on process model understanding. Our objective is two-fold. First, we test if linked rules can improve a model user’s understanding of business process and rules. Second, by using eye-tracking technology in the experiment, we break down the statistics to the Process Model Area, Rule Area and Question Area and see what kind of information (process model, or rules) contributes most to our hypotheses. Third, we investigate the differences between other aspects of human cognitive behaviour such as single visit time and attention switching between groups, further exploring whether linked rules can improve process model understanding.

AB  - The EcoKnow project strives to promote flexible case management systems in the public administration and empower end-users (i.e., case workers) to make sense of digitized models of the law. For this, a hybrid representation combining the declarative DCR notation with textual annotations depicting the law text and a simulation tool to simulate the execution of single process instances was proposed. This hybrid representation aims to overcome the notorious limitations of existing declarative notations in term of understandability. Using eye tracking, this paper investigates how users engage with the different artifacts of the hybrid representation.

EP  - 459
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Business process models have been adopted by enterprises for more than a decade. Especially for domain experts, the comprehension of process models constitutes a challenging task that needs to be mastered when creating or reading these models. This paper presents the results we obtained from an eye tracking experiment on process model comprehension. In detail, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling were confronted with models expressed in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), reflecting different levels of difficulty. The first results of this experiment confirm recent findings from one of our previous experiments on the reading and comprehension of process models. On one hand, independent from their level of expertise, all individuals face similar patterns, when being confronted with process models exceeding a certain level of difficulty. On the other, it appears that process models expressed in terms of EPCs are perceived differently compared to process models specified in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). In the end, their generalization needs to be confirmed by additional empirical experiments. The presented experiment continues a series of experiments that aim to unravel the factors fostering the comprehension of business process models by using methods and theories stemming from the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.

TI  - From analytical purposes to data visualizations: a decision process guided by a conceptual framework and eye tracking
JO  - Software & Systems Modeling
AB  - Data visualizations are versatile tools for gaining cognitive access to large amounts of data and for making complex relationships in data understandable. This paper proposes a method for assessing data visualizations according to the purposes they fulfill in domain-specific data analysis settings. We introduce a framework that gets configured for a given analysis domain and allows to choose data visualizations in a methodically justified way, based on analysis questions that address different aspects of data to be analyzed. Based on the concepts addressed by the analysis questions, the framework provides systematic guidance for determining which data visualizations are able to serve which conceptual analysis interests. In a second step of the method, we propose to follow a data-driven approach and to experimentally compare alternative data visualizations for a particular analytical purpose. More specifically, we propose to use eye tracking to support justified decisions about which of the data visualizations selected with the help of the framework are most suitable for assessing the analysis domain in a cognitively efficient way. We demonstrate our approach of how to come from analytical purposes to data visualizations using the example domain of Process Modeling Behavior Analysis. The analyses are performed on the background of representative analysis questions from this domain.

TI  - Mining reading patterns from eye-tracking data: method and demonstration
JO  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - Understanding how developers interact with different software artifacts when performing comprehension tasks has a potential to improve developers’ productivity. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze eye-tracking data using process mining to find distinct reading patterns of how developers interacted with the different artifacts. To validate our approach, we conducted an exploratory study using eye-tracking involving 11 participants. We applied our method to investigate how developers interact with different artifacts during domain and code understanding tasks. To contextualize the reading patterns and to better understand the perceived benefits and challenges participants associated with the different artifacts and their choice of reading patterns, we complemented the eye-tracking data with the data obtained from think aloud. The study used behavior-driven development, a development practice that is increasingly used in Agile software development contexts, as a setting. The study shows that our method can be used to explore developers’ behavior at an aggregated level and identify behavioral patterns at varying levels of granularity.

In this paper we aim to complement previous insights on the modeler’s modeling behavior with data gathered by tracking the modeler’s eye movements when engaged in the act of modeling. We present preliminary results and outline directions for future research to triangulate toward a more comprehensive understanding of the process of process modeling. We believe that combining different views on the process of process modeling constitutes another building block in understanding this process that will ultimately enable us to support modelers in creating better process models.

AB  - Due to the use of thousands of often very complex process models, having them immediately usable towards their purpose is of great economic benefit. In order to maximize usability, process models must be intuitive and easily understandable. In other words, processing the information contained within the process models must enable a successful completion of the task for which the model is being used. Recently, research efforts into the effects of user characteristics on understandability have increased. However, current limitations create promising research possibilities, particularly with regard to the use of realistic process models and direct data collection techniques. This thesis will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by investigating domain knowledge as a fundamental user characteristic and utilizing eye-tracking as a direct data collection method while using realistic, complex process models. The end goal of this research is to propose an automatic process model tailoring technique, with the aim of enhancing a user’s understanding and thus their performance. As of now a pilot study has indicated the existence of distinct reading strategies, which establishes the viability of the proposed future work.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye tracking can be applied to a variety of scenarios as a means of measuring visual attention and interpreting visual solution strategies. In this article, we use mobile eye-tracker to collect information to evaluate user satisfaction with the tax service office. Mobile eye tracking can collect precise information concerning the users’ visual attention and interactions in authentic environments. Unlike screen-based eye-tracker using a laboratory or stationary computer, mobile eye tracking also can be used effectively in a walk a round scene where users could walk around and interact with diverse resources. In the progress of eye tracking data analysis, fixations and gaze points, areas of interest (AOIs), heat-maps play an important role. This annotation is typically the most time-consuming step of the analysis process. To reduce processing time and human effort, we introduced the latest computer vision techniques (i.e., You Only Look Once, YOLO) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and recognize specific objects in recorded video. We propose a new method to evaluate the user satisfaction of a service system by implicating mobile eye tracker. In addition we gave a new idea of using CNN-based object detection technique to annotate video data collected by mobile eye tracker, which could be followed up for further analysis.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1109
EP  - 1154
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of dyslexia on the reading and comprehension of computer program code. Drawing upon work from the fields of program comprehension, eye tracking, dyslexia, models of reading and dyslexia gaze behaviour, a set of hypotheses is developed with which to investigate potential differences in the gaze behaviour of programmers with dyslexia compared to typical programmers. The hypotheses posit that, in general terms, programmers with dyslexia will show gaze behaviour of longer duration and a greater number of fixations on program features than typical programmers. An experiment is described in which 28 programmers (14 with dyslexia, 14 without dyslexia) were asked to read and explain three simple computer programs. Eye tracking technology is used to capture the gaze behaviour of the programmers. Data analysis suggests that the code reading behaviour of programmers with dyslexia is not what would be expected based on the dyslexia literature relating to natural text. In conjunction with further exploratory analysis, observations are made in relation to spatial differences in how programmers with dyslexia read and scan code. The results show that the gaze behaviour of programmers with dyslexia requires further study to understand effects such as code layout, identifier naming and line length. A possible impact on dyslexia gaze behaviour is from the visual crowding of features in program code which might cause certain program features to receive less attention during a program comprehension task.

The strongly visual nature of these interactive information delivery tools mandates a new look at techniques for evaluating their usefulness and usability. Tracking the eyes of users as they work with such systems, when combined with traditional evaluation methods from Human—Computer Interaction, can provide a powerful new evaluation approach to the designer. This paper reports on the technical aspects of such an approach that we have developed, and describes a pilot experiment on its application to educational hypermedia.

TI  - Effect of Linked Rules on Business Process Model Understanding

SP  - 200
EP  - 215
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Business process models are widely used in organizations by information systems analysts to represent complex business requirements and by business users to understand business operations and constraints. This understanding is extracted from graphical process models as well as business rules. Prior research advocated integrating business rules into business process models to improve the effectiveness of important organizational activities, such as developing shared understanding, effective communication, and process improvement. However, whether such integrated modeling can improve the understanding of business processes has not been empirically evaluated. In this paper, we report on an experiment that investigates the effect of linked rules, a specific rule integration approach, on business process model understanding. Our results indicate that linked rules are associated with better time efficiency in interpreting business operations, less mental effort, and partially associated with improved accuracy of understanding.

AB  - The Business Process Management is considered as a new way of managing the organization. It’s based on the principles managing the organization when the processes have the key role. It is managerial discipline that uses the technologies for the process oriented management. The authors discuss the possibilities to measure quality of process models’ design and give the answer to the questions: how to measure the BPM quality, if it is possible and, if yes, how to do that. The authors use collaborative usability lab and suggest to implement “pair usability testing” principle for BPM quality evaluation.

AB  - Brain-Neural Machine/Computer Interface (BNCI) has been used successfully as an assistive technology to restore communication, improve control and thus potentially enhance social inclusion. Recently BNCI technology and interfaces have evolved to become more usable, thereby allowing the recording of brain activity to become part of the wider self-quantification movement. A hybrid BNCI can provide a viable but alternative interface for Human Computer Interaction, which combines the inputs from BNCI and eye tracking. This hybrid approach has maintained information transfer rate but increased robustness and overall usability. The combination of two complementary technologies provides the possibility for investigating new ways of human enhancement and has the potential to open up new medical applications.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative software development technique in which unit tests are defined before production code, while Test-Last Development (TLD) is a more traditional development technique in which unit tests are written after the features are implemented. There have been a number of empirical studies investigating the effects of TDD compared to other approaches in terms of software quality and productivity. However, there are few investigations in which the TDD effects are explored from the viewpoint of the developers’ experience. This paper presents an eye-tracking study carried out in order to measure visual attention during the coding and test tasks when developers are using TDD compared to TLD. Our preliminary findings pointed out a similar visual effort proportion in both techniques, but a difference regarding eye gaze behavior between them which needs to be confirmed.

AB  - We examine the ability of eye movement data to help understand the determinants of decision-making over risky prospects. We start with structural models of choice under risk, and use that structure to inform what we identify from the use of process data in addition to choice data. We find that information on eye movements does significantly affect the extent and nature of probability weighting behavior. Our structural model allows us to show the pathway of the effect, rather than simply identifying a reduced form effect. This insight should be of importance for the normative design of choice mechanisms for risky products. We also show that decision-response duration is no substitute for the richer information provided by eye-tracking.

TI  - Understanding Declare models: strategies, pitfalls, empirical results
JO  - Software & Systems Modeling
SP  - 325
EP  - 352
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
AB  - Declarative approaches to business process modeling are regarded as well suited for highly volatile environments, as they enable a high degree of flexibility. However, problems in understanding and maintaining declarative process models often impede their adoption. Likewise, little research has been conducted into the understanding of declarative process models. This paper takes a first step toward addressing this fundamental question and reports on an empirical investigation consisting of an exploratory study and a follow-up study focusing on the system analysts’ sense-making of declarative process models that are specified in Declare. For this purpose, we distributed real-world Declare models to the participating subjects and asked them to describe the illustrated process and to perform a series of sense-making tasks. The results of our studies indicate that two main strategies for reading Declare models exist: either considering the execution order of the activities in the process model, or orienting by the layout of the process model. In addition, the results indicate that single constraints can be handled well by most subjects, while combinations of constraints pose significant challenges. Moreover, the study revealed that aspects that are similar in both imperative and declarative process modeling languages at a graphical level, while having different semantics, cause considerable troubles. This research not only helps guiding the future development of tools for supporting system analysts, but also gives advice on the design of declarative process modeling notations and points out typical pitfalls to teachers and educators of future systems analysts.

JO  - Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology
SP  - 587
EP  - 599
VL  - 38
IS  - 5
AB  - Acording to social information processing theories, aggressive children are hypersensitive to cues of hostility and threat in other people’s behavior. However, even though there is ample evidence that aggressive children over-interpret others’ behaviors as hostile, it is unclear whether this hostile attribution tendency does actually result from overattending to hostile and threatening cues. Since encoding is posited to consist of rapid automatic processes, it is hard to assess with the selfreport measures that have been used so far. Therefore, we used a novel approach to investigate visual encoding of social information. The eye movements of thirty 10–13 year old children with lower levels and thirty children with higher levels of aggressive behavior were monitored in real time with an eyetracker, as the children viewed ten different cartoon series of ambiguous provocation situations. In addition, participants answered questions concerning encoding and interpretation. Aggressive children did not attend more to hostile cues, nor attend less to non-hostile cues than non-aggressive children. Contrary, aggressive children looked longer at non-hostile cues, but nonetheless attributed more hostile intent than their non-aggressive peers. These findings contradict the traditional bottom-up processing hypotheses that aggressive behavior would be related with failure to attend to non-hostile cues. The findings seem best explained by topdown information processing, where aggressive children’s pre-existing hostile intent schemata (1) direct attention towards schema inconsistent non-hostile cues, (2) prevent further processing and recall of such schema-inconsistent information, and (3) lead to hostile intent attribution and aggressive responding, disregarding the schema-inconsistent non-hostile information.

TI  - Eye Tracking Based Objective Evaluation of Visual Aesthetics: A Review
BT  - Advances in Ergonomics in Design
SP  - 370
EP  - 381
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The process of having an aesthetic experience is a very complex cognitive phenomenon. Human perception is governed by vision, and visual perception is guided by the attractiveness of stimuli. Visual information covers more than half of the sensory information during an aesthetic experience. It reflects the higher dependency of human perceptibility/cognition on the eye compared to other sensory channels. Thus, eye tracker based evaluation of visual scanning behaviour has emerged as an important technique of aesthetic appraisal in recent years. There is a constant argument over the years that an aesthetic experience of the subconscious brain can be studied from the visual scanning behaviour of the human eye. Hence, the current paper aims to review the scope of eye tracking as an objective way to analyze the visual aesthetics. Following extensive literature search on the topics pertaining to aesthetic perception; aesthetic experience; objective measures of aesthetics; visual exploration; eye tracking variables and its correlation with human behaviour etc., were segregated and presented as systematic manner. The present paper shows the potentiality of the eye tracking research considering the past implications, recent developments, and relevant future growth in the field of visual aesthetic evaluation.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a human-machine system (HMS) experiment, which was conducted to explore how to combine textual and graphical information in an interface. Specifically, this paper explored how the location of textual and graphical information would influence response time, accuracy and eye movement. We also explored the effectiveness of three different configurations (9, 16, and 25 points). Our findings suggest that if the accuracy was the highest priority, the textual information should be placed at the left side of the screen and the graphical information should not be placed at the center of the screen. If a quicker response time was the highest priority, the graphical information should not be placed at the corners and bottom right margins. Finally, if an interface includes both textual and graphical elements, graphical information could be placed at corner and margin areas and textual information could be placed at corner areas to facilitate the efficiency of information processing. From the perspective of response accuracy and response time, the 9-point configuration was most appropriate for the calibration process.

AB  - Process design artifacts (e.g., process models, textual process descriptions and simulations) are increasingly used to provide input for requirements elicitation and to facilitate the design of business processes. To support the understandability of process models and make them accessible for end-users with different backgrounds, several hybrid representations combining different design artifacts have been proposed in the literature. This paper investigates the understandability of DCR-HR, a new hybrid process design artifact based on DCR graphs. Using eye-tracking and think-aloud techniques, this paper explores the benefits and challenges associated with the use of different design artifacts and investigates the way end-users engage with them. The results motivate the use of DCR-HR and provide insights about the support it provides to end-users with different backgrounds.

AB  - The quality of a business process model is presumably highly dependent upon the modeling process that was followed to create it. Still, there is a lack of concepts to investigate this connection empirically. This paper introduces the formal concept of a phase diagram through which the modeling process can be analyzed, and a corresponding implementation to study a modeler’s sequence of actions. In an experiment building on these assets, we observed a group of modelers engaging in the act of modeling. The collected data is used to demonstrate our approach for analyzing the process of process modeling. Additionally, we are presenting first insights and sketch requirements for future experiments.

AB  - The previous studies found the differences of eye movements between systematic and heuristic processing were inconsistent. To bridge this gap, we manipulated both systematic and heuristic processings (using high vs. low distractions) and argument quality (using strong vs. weak), and measured both eye movements and self-reported attitude. The results suggested that low distraction induced larger differentiation of post-message attitude between strong and weak arguments compared to high distraction, indicating the successful operation of both processings. More importantly, low distraction enabled more fixations and shorter saccade lengths independent of argument quality. However, no differentiations were found involving fixation duration, regressions, and reading speed. In addition, argument quality influenced eye movements, i.e., less fixation and faster reading speed were found in strong arguments. Our results explain why distractions reduce the efficiency of information processing from an eye tracking perspective and why fixation duration results were inconsistent in the previous studies.

VL  - 41
IS  - 6
AB  - In the present study, we examined constructs of emotion regulation (emotion regulation difficulties, expressive suppression, and cognitive reappraisal) in relation to attentional bias to threat (ABT). Participants (N = 176) completed a battery of self-report measures and an eye-tracking task in which eye movements to neutral and threat images were recorded. Dwell time on threat was examined across six 500 ms intervals for each trial. We also examined pupillary response as a measure of emotional arousal. When accounting for cognitive reappraisal and emotion regulation difficulties, expressive suppression significantly predicted both ABT (from 1500–3000 ms) and pupillary response to threat. However, the effect of expression suppression on ABT was significant only at lower levels of cognitive reappraisal. Emotion regulation difficulties did not significantly predict ABT or pupillary response. Findings suggest that those who use expressive suppression to the exclusion of other regulatory strategies may be at particularly high risk for ABT and relatively higher levels of threat-related emotional arousal. Clinical implications, as well as results of an exploratory analysis examining dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties as they relate to ABT and pupillary response, will be discussed.

AB  - The last decade has seen an increasing interest in marketing in the use of modern eye-tracking equipment for developing and testing theories of search and choice. This chapter reviews this development and provides a framework that assists marketing researchers in collecting and processing eye tracking data and incorporating that data into marketing decision models. The authors demonstrate how eye movement data is collected using modern eye-tracking equipment, and how such data relates to underlying visual processes. The chapter discusses key eye-tracking measures and illustrates how such measures can be integrated into decision models of search and choice. This chapter provides useful insights for researchers interested in setting up eye-tracking experiments, as well as for researchers interested in understanding how such data can be summarized and incorporated into their models.

AB  - We found fundamental problems with the quality of business process models designed by students during education. Their design very often miss particular quality (from the business point of view). To ensure high quality of the designed process models opportunity should be given in order to use the mathematical expression’s qualitative characteristic of the process model (i.e. quality measures of the process model). To improve their knowledge, we are trying to find metrics for quality process measurement. These metrics must be able to influent the quality of the model. This quality is affected by the experiences and knowledge of the process designer, mainly students. That’s why the process creation is immediately followed by the quality control. The quality control shows if the modelled process models are created according to the expected quality. We develop the software to an educative tool to support a quality of designed process model. This tool serves as a very important educative tool for the teaching of the process modelling and to get feedback from students works. The goal of this paper is to describe how to improve the business process model educative skills, using quality measures of the process model.

AB  - The focus of this study is investigating efficiency of coding and grouping methods in reducing split attention effect in scientific graphs and diagrams by applying local changes in the structure of scientific materials. The diagrams and graphs are regularly used in the structure of materials along with textual explanation to provide supplementary information and insight to the readers and is referred as redundancy principle. In some cases, the redundant presentation of visual and textual content could lead to split attention effect and cognitive overload. Although, multimedia learning theory claims that in order to enhance learning, information should be presented in multi-mode format the design and implementation of the multi-modal presentation is of great importance. Having incredible flexibility, if multimedia elements are not applied properly, they cause confusion and adversely affect comprehension of the readers.

BT  - Research into Design for a Connected World

PB  - Springer Singapore
CY  - Singapore
AB  - In the context of visual aesthetics, a bottom-up approach deals with the features of the visual stimuli such as form, texture, color, novelty, complexity, composition, contrast, and order. These features influence subject’s perception during an aesthetic experience. As per philosophy, both subject and object should be present to have an aesthetic experience. Though there are several attempts reported by the researchers to evaluate visual aesthetics using biometric technologies, eye tracking has been found to be an efficient technique to investigate bottom-up aesthetic processes that operate with both object and subject. As reported by earlier researchers, the eye tracking-based studies convey meaningful visual aesthetic properties from visual exploration patterns of the subjects and have been reviewed thoroughly in the present paper. Different types of human visual behavior during aesthetic visual exploration (specific and diversive) have also been mentioned with citation of earlier works. Most of the reported eye tracking-based researches are limited to saliency study and have used unstructured variables to evaluate visual aesthetics. It has been observed from the available literature that the level of complexity and quality of composition of the visuals may be considered as the well-accepted measures to judge the aesthetic experience. Association of various sub-variables of composition (symmetry, balance, and proportion) and complexity (number of elements, variety of elements, and order of elements) with different eye tracking variables (fixation frequency, fixation duration, and first fixation) has already been reported by the researchers in a discrete manner. Hence, there is a need for the future research to establish correlations between various eye tracking variables and the measures of aesthetics with the ultimate aim of objective-measurement of visual aesthetics.

AB  - This research has adopted eye movement technique to study the influence of warning character on the information processing, which involves in two experiments. With our study, we have made our focus of research on the warning position, warning icon and warning border as a visual stimulus means. In our investigation, we have been keeping on with such commonly-made eye-movement recording parameters, such as the Fixation Count, the First Fixation and Duration by using an Eye Link II eye tracker, which is in a position to reflect the subject’s attention and conversion of the attentions. What is more, we have done a single factor variance analysis (ANOVA) in hoping to work out the experimental data due to the kinds of eye movement parameters, and the following conclusions were drawn: (1) The warning position on the warning interface affects the machining process of the warning. When the warning is embedded in text, the warning is more noticeable and the perceived hazard level is higher. (2) Consistent with the results of the relevant studies on warnings on product labels, there are also icon effects on the warning interface, and the icon can improve the salience of the warning itself and the level of perceived danger. (3) There are also border effects on the warning interface. The appearance of the border makes the warning more significant and the perceived hazard level can be improved. The research results of this paper can also be adopted as the warning message design reference, which has had a great significance in improving the identification of warning message and reducing the rate of visual accidents on interface.

BT  - Advances in Computational Intelligence
SP  - 110

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology has achieved limited success outside of laboratory conditions. This technology is hindered by practical considerations of set up, lack of robustness and low Information Transfer Rate (ITR). There are two interfaces in a BCI system: the brain’s interface with the computer and the computer-environment interface, which provides access to applications for the user. Three user services were implemented: control of the smart home, entertainment and communication. These may be accessed through a graphical user interface controlled by a BCI. The paper contrasts the performance of an SSVEP based system with a hybrid BCI comprising eye gaze and muscle response (measured at the scalp). The hybrid developed utilizes the EPOC for recording electrical potential and an EyeTribe gaze tracker; these can be combined to provide more robust interaction with applications. Average ITR for the eye tracker and hybrid approaches (190-200 bpm) are higher than for our SSVEP approach (approx. 15 bpm), for the same applications. The poor performance of our SSVEP system was due to the temporal duration of the stimulation (7s) and partly because not all participants could achieve an accuracy of greater than 50%. The current challenge is the replacement of the scalp recorded muscle component with a reliable user modifiable EEG measure.

AB  - To detect phishing mails, various strategies based on a reliable cryptography-based security framework exist. Nevertheless, the user themselves still provide a greater opportunity for phishing attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the user deals with phishing mails when confronted with them. This study limits itself to visual stimuli of phishing mails and therefore uses an eye-tracking procedure to determine the gaze behavior. Twenty-one different mails were used for this experiment, of which fourteen were phishing mails. The task of the users was to decide whether it was a phishing mail or a real mail. For the evaluation, the individual mails were provided with Areas of Interest (AOIs). This is similar to the usual components of a mail that would be attachment, body, footer, header and signature. Thereafter, three artificial groups were formed. There was one group with a low score of correct answers, one with a middle score and one with a high score. These three groups were then compared and showed differences in processing time. This led to the assumption that knowledge and time are two important factors in recognizing phishing mails.

AB  - Recent researches reveal effort to observe user’s experience from user’s point of view in order to estimate usability of a web site. Eye-tracking and mouse-tracking to record and analysis what user sees and how user acts can be proper examples. However, although eye-tracking and mouse-tracking are used practically, not only difficult to find the case that uses both, but also the case is rare that considers what user is thinking. Hence, this paper introduced EMT System that tracks eye and mouse, and records user’s thinking. And for applying EMT system, this paper developed EMT Tool, which helps a researcher to do usability test by recording the user’s experience, and reproducing it visually. EMT Tool is consist of EMT Tracker which is responsible for observing and collecting user’s experience and EMT Analyzer synthesizing and analyzing data from EMT Tracker.

AB  - Enterprise information, such as policies and procedures, enterprise data, enterprise social networks, and emails, to name a few, all reside in different information systems. This situation results in information silos, which in turn lead to the increased cost of information integration and reduced capacity for exploiting synergies within the organization. In fact, information silos in organizational information systems can result in inefficiency of information retrieval, redundancy and conflicts between information assets of the company, leading to duplication of efforts and job roles, as well as an incomplete understanding of the organization.

SP  - 129
EP  - 151
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
AB  - Previous psycholinguistic studies have shown that bilinguals activate lexical items of both the languages during auditory and visual word processing. In this study we examined if Hindi–English bilinguals activate the orthographic forms of phonological neighbors of translation equivalents of the non target language while listening to words either in L1 or L2. We tracked participant’s eye movements as they looked at an array of written words that contained a phonological neighbor of the translation equivalent of a simultaneously presented spoken word. Participants quickly oriented their visual attention towards the phonological neighbor of the translation equivalent compared to the distractors, suggesting an activation of the spelling of the non-target lexicon via translation leading to further spreading activation of related words. Further, this parallel activation of the non target lexicon was seen in both L1–L2 and L2–L1 direction. These results suggest that different bilinguals can automatically activate the orthographic forms of the non-target lexicon via translation equivalents even when the languages in question do not share cognates and use different scripts.

AB  - While factors impacting process model comprehension are relatively well understood by now, little is known about process model creation and factors impacting the quality of the resulting process model as well as the modeler’s cognitive load. In this paper we propose to combine a continuous, psycho-physiological measurement of cognitive load with a detailed analysis of the modeler’s interactions of the modeling environment as well as eye movement analysis to obtain task-specific imposed cognitive load values. We present initial results in terms of a tool, lessons learnt from a pilot study and discuss upcoming challenges. This work provides the basis for investigating task imposed cognitive load during process model creation by enabling a dynamic, semi–automatic analysis of cognitive load.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 779
EP  - 793
VL  - 45
IS  - 4
AB  - In an eye-tracking experiment, we examined the processing of the nominal control construction. Participants’ eye-movements were monitored while they read sentences that included either giver control nominals (e.g. promise in Luke’s promise to Sophia to photograph himself) or recipient control nominals (e.g. plea in Luke’s plea to Sophia to photograph herself). In order to examine both the initial access of control information, and its later use in on-line processing, we combined a manipulation of nominal control with a gender match/mismatch paradigm. Results showed that there was evidence of processing difficulty for giver control sentences (relative to recipient control sentences) at the point where the control dependency was initially created, suggesting that control information was accessed during the early parsing stages. This effect is attributed to a recency preference in the formation of control dependencies; the parser prefers to assign a recent antecedent to PRO. In addition, readers slowed down after reading a reflexive pronoun that mismatched with the gender of the antecedent indicated by the control nominal (e.g. Luke’s promise to Sophia to photograph herself). The mismatch cost suggests that control information of the nominal control construction was used to constrain dependency formation involving a controller, PRO and a reflexive, confirming the use of control information in on-line interpretation.

VL  - 18

AB  - Mature verification and monitoring approaches, such as complex event processing and model checking, can be applied for checking compliance specifications at design time and runtime. Little is known about the understandability of the different formal and technical languages associated with these approaches. This uncertainty regarding understandability might be a major obstacle for the broad practical adoption of those techniques. This article reports a controlled experiment with 215 participants on the understandability of modeling compliance specifications in representative modeling languages, namely linear temporal logic (LTL), the complex event processing-based event processing language (EPL) and property specification patterns (PSP). The formalizations in PSP were overall more correct. That is, the pattern-based approach provides a higher level of understandability than EPL and LTL. More advanced users, however, seemingly are able to cope equally well with PSP and EPL in modeling compliance specifications.

TI  - Eye Movements During Mathematical Word Problem Solving—Global Measures and Individual Differences
JO  - Journal für Mathematik-Didaktik
SP  - 255
EP  - 287
VL  - 40
IS  - 2
AB  - In mathematical word problem solving, reading and mathematics interact. Previous research used the method of eye tracking to analyze reading processes but focused on specific elements in prototype word problems. This makes it difficult to compare the role of reading in longer, more complex word problems and between individuals. We used global measures of eye movements that refer to the word problem as a whole, similar to methods used in research on eye movements during reading. Global measures allow comparisons of reading processes of word problems of different structure. To test if these global measures are related to cognitive processes during word problem solving, we analyzed the relation between eye movements and the perceived difficulty of a task and its solution rate. We conducted two experiments with adults and undergraduate students (N = 17 and N = 42), solving challenging mathematical word problems from PISA. Experiment 1 showed that more difficult items were read with shorter fixations, more saccades, more regressions, and slower, with correlations ranging from r = 0.70 to r = 0.86. Multilevel modelling in experiment 2 revealed that for the number of saccades and the proportion of regressions, the relationship was stronger for low-performing students, with performance explaining up to 37% of the variance between students. These two measures are primarily associated with building a problem model. We discuss how this approach enables the use of eye tracking in complex mathematical word problem solving and contributes to our understanding of the role of reading in mathematics.

TI  - A Recurrent Quantum Neural Network Model to Describe Eye Tracking of Moving Targets
JO  - Foundations of Physics Letters
SP  - 357
EP  - 370
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
AB  - A theoretical quantum neural network model is proposed using a nonlinear Schrödinger wave equation. The model proposes that there exists a nonlinear Schrödinger wave equation that mediates the collective response of a neural lattice. The model is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a recurrent quantum neural network(RQNN) while simulating the eye tracking model, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data is processed in a classical neural network, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum neural network.This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a fixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a discrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye consisting of ‘jumps’ and ‘rests’. However, such a saccadic movement is intertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic trajectory. In a sense, this is the first theoretical model explaining the experimental observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene situation. The resulting prediction is found to be very precise and efficient in comparison to classical objective modeling schemes such as the Kalman filter.

JO  - Advances in Health Sciences Education
SP  - 1053
EP  - 1060
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
AB  - Making a diagnosis involves ratifying or verifying a proposed answer. Formalizing this verification process with checklists, which highlight key variables involved in the diagnostic decision, is often advocated. However, the mechanisms by which a checklist might allow clinicians to improve their verification process have not been well studied. We hypothesize that using a checklist to verify diagnostic decisions enhances analytic scrutiny of key variables, thereby improving clinicians’ ability to find and fix mistakes. We asked 16 participants to verify their interpretation of 12 electrocardiograms, randomly assigning half to be verified with a checklist and half with an analytic prompt. While participants were verifying their interpretation, we tracked their eye movements. We analyzed these eye movements using a series of eye tracking variables theoretically linked to analytic scrutiny of key variables. We found that more errors were corrected using a checklist compared to an analytic prompt (.27 ± .53 errors per ECG vs. .04 ± .43, F1,15 = 8.1, p = .01, η2 = .20). Checklist use was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny in all eye tracking measures assessed (F6,10 = 6.0, p = .02). In this experiment, using a key variable checklist to verify diagnostic decisions improved error detection. This benefit was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny of those key variables as measured by eye tracking.

AB  - This research discusses a new approach that uses patterns of a person’s eye motion to improve human computer interaction between intelligent virtual agents (IVA) and the people who interact with them. This approach adds new capability to current eye tracking interfaces that focus on eye fixations instead of patterns of motion. The analysis of eye motion on the pattern level can deliver three values to an eye tracking interface: speed, interaction reliability, and a more complete understanding of user attention. This research builds a system, called InVision, to demonstrate how the analysis of eye fixation at the pattern level can improve eye tracking interfaces for human computer interaction. An IVA is built using this eye pattern analysis technique.

JO  - Behavior Research Methods
SP  - 2074
EP  - 2096
VL  - 50
IS  - 5
AB  - The first stage of analyzing eye-tracking data is commonly to code the data into sequences of fixations and saccades. This process is usually automated using simple, predetermined rules for classifying ranges of the time series into events, such as “if the dispersion of gaze samples is lower than a particular threshold, then code as a fixation; otherwise code as a saccade.” More recent approaches incorporate additional eye-movement categories in automated parsing algorithms by using time-varying, data-driven thresholds. We describe an alternative approach using the beta-process vector auto-regressive hidden Markov model (BP-AR-HMM). The BP-AR-HMM offers two main advantages over existing frameworks. First, it provides a statistical model for eye-movement classification rather than a single estimate. Second, the BP-AR-HMM uses a latent process to model the number and nature of the types of eye movements and hence is not constrained to predetermined categories. We applied the BP-AR-HMM both to high-sampling rate gaze data from Andersson et al. (Behavior Research Methods49(2), 1–22 2016) and to low-sampling rate data from the DIEM project (Mital et al., Cognitive Computation3(1), 5–24 2011). Driven by the data properties, the BP-AR-HMM identified over five categories of movements, some which clearly mapped on to fixations and saccades, and others potentially captured post-saccadic oscillations, smooth pursuit, and various recording errors. The BP-AR-HMM serves as an effective algorithm for data-driven event parsing alone or as an initial step in exploring the characteristics of gaze data sets.

AB  - Reading disability is a condition in which a person is analyzed with difficulty in reading There are different types of reading disorders, some of them are dyslexia, alexia. Recent research has identified that one of the causes for this disability could be hereditary factors. Detecting on time and proper treatment helps in improving the reading ability of a dyslexic child. Proposed method provides a user friendly approach for analyzing the children dyslexic disorder level using an Eye Tracker. Proposed module uses set of input stimulus to analyze all the parameters that could identify the stage of disability in a child. At the end of experiment a dashboard showing the results that could provide a detailed information for the doctor to decide the treatment that could help in reducing child’s reading disability. The proposed system increases the understandability of dyslexic disorder levels of a child as it display all the parameters that are measured to test the level of disorder in the form of a dashboard through a web page.

AB  - Research on process-aware information systems (PAIS) has experienced a dramatic growth in recent years. Lately, a particular increase of empirical studies and focus on human oriented research questions could be observed, leading to an expansion of applied evaluation methods in PAIS research. At the same time, it can be observed that evaluation methods are not always applied in a systematic manner and related terminology is at times used in an ambiguous way. Hence, the paper aims at investigating evaluation methods that are typically employed in PAIS research with a special focus on human orientation. The applied methodology includes a literature review, an expert survey, and a focus group. The authors present their findings as a collection of typical evaluation methods and the related PAIS artifacts. They highlight which evaluation methods are currently used and which evaluation methods could be of interest for future PAIS research efforts.

AB  - Technology-assisted intervention has the potential to adaptively individualize and improve outcomes of traditional schizophrenia (SZ) intervention. Virtual reality (VR) technology, in particular, has the potential to simulate real world social and communication interactions and hence could be useful as a therapeutic platform for SZ. Emotional face recognition is considered among the core building blocks of social communication. Studies have shown that emotional face processing and understanding is impaired in patients with SZ. The current study develops a novel VR-based system that presents avatars that can change their facial emotion dynamically for emotion recognition tasks. Additionally, this system allows real-time measurement of physiological signals and eye gaze during the emotion recognition tasks, which can be used to gain insight about the emotion recognition process in SZ population. This study further compares VR-based facial emotion recognition with that of the more traditional emotion recognition from static faces using a small usability study. Results from the usability study suggest that VR could be a viable platform for SZ intervention and implicit signals such as physiological signals and eye gaze can be utilized to better understand the underlying pattern that is not available from user reports and performance alone.

AB  - This chapter includes the development of an evaluation framework focusing on the usability assessment of graphical modeling languages. Concerning this, the present status quo in research is analyzed and presented. Furthermore, an adequate definition of usability and related attributes is analyzed. Based on this, qualified metrics and measurement methods are developed for measuring the different attributes of usability in the domain of graphical modeling languages. This evaluation framework acts as a basis for the usability surveys conducted in the further course of this thesis [Schalles et al., 2010b].

AB  - Technology-enabled intervention has the potential to individualize and improve outcomes of traditional intervention. Specifically, virtual reality (VR) technology has been proposed in the virtual training of core social and communication skills that are impaired in individuals with autism. Various studies have demonstrated that children with autism have slow and atypical processing of emotional faces, which could be due to their atypical underlying neural structure. Emotional face recognition is considered among the core building blocks of social communication and early impairment in this skill has consequence on later complex language and communication skills. This work proposed a VR-based facial emotion recognition mechanism in the presence of contextual storytelling. Results from a usability study support the idea that individuals with autism may employ different facial processing strategies. The results are discussed in the context of the applicability of multimodal processing to enable adaptive VR-based systems in delivering individualized intervention.

AB  - Understanding conceptual models of business domains is a key skill for practitioners tasked with systems analysis and design. Research in this field predominantly uses experiments with specific user proxy cohorts to examine factors that explain how well different types of conceptual models can be comprehended by model viewers. However, the results from these studies are difficult to compare. One key difficulty rests in the unsystematic and fluctuating consideration of model viewer characteristics (MVCs) to date. In this paper, we review MVCs used in prominent prior studies on conceptual model comprehension. We then design an empirical review of the influence of MVCS through a global, cross-sectional experimental study in which over 500 student and practitioner users were asked to answer comprehension questions about a prominent type of conceptual model - BPMN process models. As an experimental treatment, we used good versus bad layout in order to increase the variance of performance. Our results show MVC to be a multi-dimensional construct. Moreover, process model comprehension is related in different ways to different traits of the MVC construct. Based on these findings, we offer guidance for experimental designs in this area of research and provide implications for the study of MVCs.

AB  - Both business processes and business rules focus on creating a representation of the organization’s policies and practices. They are complementary modelling approaches as they address distinct aspects of organizational practices. The conceptual and pragmatic overlap between business process models and business rules indicates a need to model the two related aspects together. While researchers have argued that integrated modelling of business process models and business rules can improve the understanding of business processes, this proposition has neither been theoretically analysed nor empirically evaluated. Moreover, there are situations in which a business rule is better modelled independently of a business process model, but also situations in which it is more appropriate to integrate the rule with a business process model.

VL  - 80
IS  - 3
AB  - Considering eye-fixation behavior is standard in reading research to investigate underlying cognitive processes. However, in numerical cognition research eye-tracking is used less often and less systematically. Nevertheless, we identified over 40 studies on this topic from the last 40 years with an increase of eye-tracking studies on numerical cognition during the last decade. Here, we review and discuss these empirical studies to evaluate the added value of eye-tracking for the investigation of number processing. Our literature review revealed that the way eye-fixation behavior is considered in numerical cognition research ranges from investigating basic perceptual aspects of processing non-symbolic and symbolic numbers, over assessing the common representational space of numbers and space, to evaluating the influence of characteristics of the base-10 place-value structure of Arabic numbers and executive control on number processing. Apart from basic results such as reading times of numbers increasing with their magnitude, studies revealed that number processing can influence domain-general processes such as attention shifting—but also the other way round. Domain-general processes such as cognitive control were found to affect number processing. In summary, eye-fixation behavior allows for new insights into both domain-specific and domain-general processes involved in number processing. Based thereon, a processing model of the temporal dynamics of numerical cognition is postulated, which distinguishes an early stage of stimulus-driven bottom-up processing from later more top-down controlled stages. Furthermore, perspectives for eye-tracking research in numerical cognition are discussed to emphasize the potential of this methodology for advancing our understanding of numerical cognition.

AB  - Business Intelligence & Analytics’ dashboards, data visualizations, and visual analysis systems are cognitive tools that heavily rely on our understanding of subconscious-level processing, human perception and cognitive processes overall. These cognitive tools are the focal point of data visualization subfield called Business Information Visualization (BIV). While the BIV field has seen calls for an increased need of deploying physiological sensing techniques and the use of biometric data, these calls have yet to translate to a more comprehensive evaluation of human response to visual displays and systems using business data. This research identifies and describes biometric sensors researchers should consider in BIV, provides a brief review of literature at the nexus of data visualization and biometrics, and identifies a biometric data-based research agenda and opportunities for BIV.

AB  - Discovering users’ behavior via eye-tracking data analysis is a common task that has important implications in many domains including marketing, design, behavior study, and psychology. In our project, we are interested in analyzing eye-tracking data to investigate differences between age groups in emotion regulation using visual attention. To achieve this goal, we adopted a general-purposed interactive visualization method, namely Glyph, to conduct temporal analysis on participants’ fixation data. Glyph facilitates comparison of abstract data sequences to understand group and individual patterns. In this article, we show how a visualization system adopting the Glyph method can be constructed, allowing us to understand how users shift their fixations and dwelling given different stimuli, and how different user groups differ in terms of these temporal eye-tracking patterns. The discussion demonstrates the utility of Glyph not only for the purpose of our project, but also for other eye-tracking data analyses that require exploration within the space of temporal patterns.

AB  - One of the key challenges in engineering education is the problem of teaching future engineers’ professional skills. Engineering students need to know what they do and do not know. This is termed metacognition. There is still quite a bit that we do not know about how metacognition develops in classroom settings. In this study, we discuss an exploration of these issues using both physical and virtual reality (VR) simulations of manufacturing systems; which are performed by student teams. We discuss the incorporation of measures of metacognition into a model of conflict and error to predict what types of experiences may be most helpful to produce improved metacognition in engineering students.

SP  - 465

VL  - 23
IS  - 4
AB  - Conceptual models represent the Organizational domain for which an information system is developed. These models are important tools in defining the requirements for the system. When describing an Organization or part of it, a key concept is the notion of roles played by actors in the domain. Actors in an Organization act in various roles, hence, showing that roles in a conceptual model can promote understanding of how the Organization works. However, despite the importance of roles in understanding Organizations and their prevalence in various aspects of information systems development, no consensus exists on what roles are, or how to represent them in conceptual models. In this paper, we formally define role as a conceptual modeling construct based on literature analysis, ontological concepts, and principles of classification. Using this definition, we derive guidelines for representing roles in conceptual models and suggest rules for modeling roles with the widely used extended entity-relationship grammar. Finally, we test the effectiveness of the modeling rules by conducting an experimental study to compare the domain understanding of readers using two types of conceptual modeling scripts. One script was obtained by violating the rules and the other by not violating the rules. We obtained data on domain understanding (using problem-solving questions) and on the process of understanding (using eye tracking). The results indicate that the role-based rules are not only useful for understanding the models but also provide direct clues as to why this is so.

SP  - 470

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - To date, research on the processing involved in comprehending and learning from animated diagrams has accorded a minor role only to perceptual operations in general and peripheral processing in particular. For those aspects where the role of perception is acknowledged, it is foveal rather than peripheral processing that is regarded as the main player. In this paper, we use the results from additional finer grained analysis of data collected in a recent empirical study to suggest that information from a viewer’s peripheral field can play a much more central role in animation processing than has previously been recognized. It appears that if the dynamic information comprising an animated diagram is presented in a suitable way, the resources available for visual perception can be partitioned so that responsibility is shared efficiently between foveal and peripheral processing. Implications with regard to elaboration of the Animation Processing Model and possible interventions for improving animation processing are discussed.

JO  - Psychiatric Quarterly
SP  - 747
EP  - 756
VL  - 89
IS  - 3
AB  - Social information processing theory hypothesizes that aggressive children pay more attention to cues of hostility and threat in others’ behavior, consequently leading to over-interpretation of others’ behavior as hostile. While there is abundant evidence of aggressive children demonstrating hostile attribution biases, less well documented is whether such biases stem from over-attendance and hypersensitivity to hostile cues in social situations. Over-attendance to hostile cues would be typified by deviations at any stage of the multi-stage process of social information processing models. While deviations at later stages in social information processing models are associated with aggressive behavior in children, the initial step of encoding has historically been difficult to empirically measure, being a low level automatic process unsuitable for self-report. We employed eye-tracking methodologies to better understand the visual encoding of such social information. Eye movements of ten 13–18 year-old children referred from clinical and non-clinical populations were recorded in real time while the children viewed scenarios varying between hostile, non-hostile and ambiguous social provocation. In addition, the children completed a brief measure of risk of aggression. Aggressive children did attend more to the social scenarios with hostile cues, in particular attending longest to those hostile scenarios where the actor in the scenario had a congruent emotional response. These findings corroborate social information processing theory and the traditional bottom-up processing hypotheses that aggressive behavior relates to increased attention to hostile cues.

TI  - Who resists belief-biased inferences? The role of individual differences in reasoning strategies, working memory, and attentional focus
JO  - Memory & Cognition
AB  - A common explanation for individual differences in the ability to draw rule-based inferences, when a putative conclusion suggests a competing belief-based inference, is that the ability to do so depends on working memory capacity. In the following studies, we examined the hypothesis that the ability to draw rule-based inferences in belief bias tasks can also be explained by individual differences in reasoning strategies and in the related attentional focus. The dual-strategy model differentiates counterexample and statistical strategies that involve different information-processing styles. In the first study (N = 139), participants completed a working memory task (operation span), a strategy diagnostic questionnaire, and a belief bias task. The results showed that individual differences in strategy use predicted performance in the belief bias problems over and above any effects of working memory capacity, with counterexample reasoners producing rule-based inferences more often than statistical reasoners. In the second study (N = 196), an eye-tracking methodology was used as a process-tracing technique to investigate attentional differences between the two strategies. On problems showing a conflict between rule-based and belief-based information, counterexample reasoners demonstrated longer fixation times on the premises than did statistical reasoners, thus providing direct evidence that individual differences in strategy use reflect different processing styles. These results clearly indicate that individual differences in strategy use are an important determinant of the way that people make inferences when rule-based and belief-based cues are both present.

SP  - 781
EP  - 801
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
AB  - New and emerging multi-screen television scenarios and applications need new evaluation procedures, methodologies, and tools to support multi-screen data analysis. In this work, we introduce a set of 12 measures to characterize viewers’ visual attention patterns for multi-screen TV. Out of these, eight measures are computed directly from eye-tracking data, while the other four are evaluated using questionnaires. We applied our measures during a controlled experiment involving nine distinct screen layouts with two, three, and four TV screens, for which we report new findings about viewers’ distributions of visual attention. For example, we found that viewers need an average discovery time up to 4.5 s to visually fixate four screens, and their subjective perceptions of what they watched and for how long they watched each screen are substantially accurate, i.e., we report Pearson’s correlation coefficients up to r = .892 with ground truth measured with eye-tracking equipment. We also analyze and discuss the evolution of our participants’ distributions of visual attention over time from the perspective of our new set of measures. For example, we found that people perform significantly more transitions between screens during the first seconds of watching television, after which their level of visual attention converges to a stable value. We complement the findings revealed by our objective eye gaze measurements with subjective data about participants’ perceived cognitive work load and comfortability while watching more than one TV screen, and we measure viewers’ capacities to understand and recall content delivered simultaneously on multiple screens. To foster new studies and explorations of viewers’ visual attention patterns during multi-screen television watching, we release in the community an update for an existing software toolkit (i.e., VATic-TV, the Visual Attention Toolkit for TV, now at version v2) that automatically computes our measures from data delivered by standard eye-tracking equipment. We hope that our new set of measures and the companion software will benefit the community as a first step toward understanding visual attention for emerging multi-screen TV applications and, consequently, will help researchers and practitioners to design new TV applications that will better exploit viewers’ visual attention patterns toward new, richer television experiences.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 1942
EP  - 1953
VL  - 23
IS  - 6
AB  - During sentence comprehension, real-time identification of a referent is driven both by local, context-independent lexical information and by more global sentential information related to the meaning of the utterance as a whole. This paper investigates the cognitive factors that limit the consideration of referents that are supported by local lexical information but not supported by more global sentential information. In an eye-tracking paradigm, participants heard sentences like “She will eat the red pear” while viewing four black-and-white (colorless) line-drawings. In the experimental condition, the display contained a “local attractor” (e.g., a heart), which was locally compatible with the adjective but incompatible with the context (“eat”). In the control condition, the local attractor was replaced by a picture which was incompatible with the adjective (e.g., “igloo”). A second factor manipulated contextual constraint, by using either a constraining verb (e.g., “eat”), or a non-constraining one (e.g., “see”). Results showed consideration of the local attractor, the magnitude of which was modulated by verb constraint, but also by each subject’s cognitive control abilities, as measured in a separate Flanker task run on the same subjects. The findings are compatible with a processing model in which the interplay between local attraction, context, and domain-general control mechanisms determines the consideration of possible referents.

IS  - 1
AB  - Eye gaze trackers (EGTs) are generally developed for scientific exploration in controlled environments or laboratories and data have been used in ophthalmology, neurology, psychology, and related areas to study oculomotor characteristics and abnormalities, and their relation to cognition and mental states. The illumination is one of the most restrictive limitation of the EGTs, due to a problem of pupil center estimation during illumination changes. Most of the current systems, indeed, work under controlled illumination conditions either in dark or indoor environments, e.g. using infrared sources or conforming the sources of light to fixed levels or pointing directions. This work is focused on exploring and comparing several photometric normalization techniques to improve EGT systems during light changes. In particular, a new wearable and wireless eye tracking system (HATCAM) is used for testing the different techniques in terms of real-time capability, eye tracking and pupil area detection. Embedding real-time image enhancement into the HATCAM can make it an innovative and robust system for eye tracking in different lighting conditions, i.e. darkness, sunlight, indoor and outdoor environments.

AB  - Difficulty (or called mental load, cognitive effort) has been an importance topic in translation and interpreting process research. This article first clarifies conceptual issues and reviews difficulty, mental workload, cognitive load and other related terms, their histories and theories. Under the umbrella of cognitive science, it then reviews two lines of research, i.e., difficulty in human translation and in postediting of machine translation. Studies concerning methods for measuring difficulty in human translation and post-editing are presented and critically examined. Two assumptions in translation difficulty research are described towards the end of this article.

AB  - We use eye-tracking to better understand the notion of expertise in conceptual modeling of complex systems. This research-in-progress paper describes an ongoing experiment to exploit the capacity of eye-tracking to explore the significance of expertise as a mediating factor in conceptual modeling. The proposed methodology highlights the applicability, validity, and potential of well-established eye-tracking methods to measure the effects of expertise. By identifying the differences in the strategies that novices and experts use to search, detect, and diagnose errors, we anticipate being able to help define training curricula appropriate for each level to improve performance and model result quality.

AB  - We conducted eye-tracking studies of subjects solving the problem of finding shortest paths in a graph using a known procedure (Dijkstra’s algorithm). The goal of these studies was to investigate how people reason about and solve graphically presented problems. First, we compared performance when the graphical display was animated to when the display was static. Second, we compared performance when the display was initially sparse, with detailed information being progressively revealed, to when the display presented all information simultaneously. Results suggest that while animation of the procedure or algorithm does not improve accuracy, animation coupled with progressively revealing objects of interest on the display does improve accuracy and other process measures of problem solving.

AB  - Researching human experiences in new media environments is an exciting endeavour, as it allows for a multitude of technologically enhanced ways to explore the situations. We are using a wide range of research methods for collecting both qualitative data (e.g. interviews, open-ended survey questions, observations) and quantitative data (e.g. questionnaires, electroencephalography (EEG), electrodermal activation (EDA), heart rate, eye tracking). In this chapter, we discuss the challenges in finding solutions for integrating different types of data in a mixed methods approach in order to answer specific research questions related to various media contexts. In addition to the eye tracker analysing tools (TobiiStudio), we are developing our own analysing software, eValu8, for synchronizing eye-tracking data with video recordings, and psychophysiological measures, such as EDA and EEG. We are exploring how to combine softwares to maximize the added value of mixed methods in integrated analyses in user experience research for the purpose of iterative design of digital content and format development.

VL  - 48
IS  - 5
AB  - Previous research suggests that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) might be associated with impairments on implicit but not explicit mentalizing tasks. However, such comparisons are made difficult by the heterogeneity of stimuli and the techniques used to measure mentalizing capabilities. We tested the abilities of 34 individuals (17 with ASD) to derive intentions from others’ actions during both explicit and implicit tasks and tracked their eye-movements. Adults with ASD displayed explicit but not implicit mentalizing deficits. Adults with ASD displayed typical fixation patterns during both implicit and explicit tasks. These results illustrate an explicit mentalizing deficit in adults with ASD, which cannot be attributed to differences in fixation patterns.

VL  - 22
IS  - 2
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether words are processed differently when they are fixated during silent reading than when they are skipped. According to a serial processing model of eye movement control (e.g., EZ Reader) skipped words are fully processed (Reichle, Rayner, Pollatsek, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 26(04):445–476, 2003), whereas in a parallel processing model (e.g., SWIFT) skipped words do not need to be fully processed (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, Kliegl, Psychological Review, 112(4):777–813, 2005). Participants read 34 sentences with target words embedded in them while their eye movements were recorded. All target words were three-letter, low-frequency, and unpredictable nouns. After the reading session, participants completed a repetition priming lexical decision task with the target words from the reading session included as the repetition prime targets, with presentation of those same words during the reading task acting as the prime. When participants skipped a word during the reading session, their reaction times on the lexical decision task were significantly longer (M = 656.42 ms) than when they fixated the word (M = 614.43 ms). This result provides evidence that skipped words are sometimes not processed to the same degree as fixated words during reading.

SP  - 185
EP  - 233
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Over recent years, the use of computer-based (and Web-based) learning has become increasingly popular. Various E-Learning systems have been developed to provide users with the opportunity to access large quantities of data, often remotely, be part of electronic courses and enjoy facilitations that once could only be part of a traditional classroom, such as communication with other students, or the teacher. However, in many cases, the information in those systems is uniformly presented to all learners, neglecting any potential particularities driven by their human nature like cognitive abilities, learning style, perceptions and affective states. In this respect, research has concentrated on creating E-Learning environments that would integrate existing theories regarding individual differences in such a way as to maximize learning performance through adaptive presentation and navigation support. The personalization factor acts as a barometer to the design quality of such systems and interfaces that positively influence the learning process, academic performance, and satisfaction of learners. In this chapter, we propose a number of human-centred design guidelines for adaptive E-Learning systems that could be considered by researchers and educators in order to create more effective and efficient personalization methods and adaptivity rules to increase the students’ learning experience and comprehension capabilities while interacting with a system.

AB  - Advanced information visualisation systems offer many different forms of interaction. Nevertheless, we do not know how useful these interactions are. Researchers have suggested to develop a science of interaction. In this paper we discuss which research methods might be appropriate to study interaction with information visualisation systems. We suggest that thinking aloud, log files and eye tracking are promising candidates. These methods enable researchers to study interaction in more detail than other methods. All these methods have strengths and weaknesses. A combination of two or three of these methods might help to overcome the weaknesses.

AB  - Some programming learners in the lowest achievement group do not have even a minimum skill to read a simple program correctly. Reading programs would be an essential programming learning. To efficiently support learners in the lowest group, firstly we should conduct a fundamental analysis of reading programs to unveil their features. Therefore, the authors focused on eye tracking as a method to carry out the idea. The authors have thought that utilizing eye movement helps to clarify the reasons for making programming learning difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of learner’s program comprehension process based on the pattern of eye movement, not the eye distribution during reading source code. In this paper, we first measure the data of eye movement during reading some source codes and propose a modeling method to represent the feature of eye movement. Then we design an experimental protocol for analyzing eye movement based on program structure. The experiment of this paper focuses on source codes based on four types of data dependency relationship that can be generated by three lines of assignment statement only. As the analysis result, we confirmed that the data dependence of each pattern appeared as the unique eye behavior of program reading.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We use eye tracking to better understand the attentional characteristics specific to successful error detection in conceptual models. This phase of our multi-step research project describes the visual comportments associated with successful semantic and syntactic error identification and diagnosis. We test our predictions, based on prior studies on visual attention in an error detection task, or studies comparing experts and non-experts in diverse tasks, in a controlled experiment where participants are tasked with detecting and diagnosing errors in 75 BPMN® models. The results suggest that successful error diagnostics are linked with shorter total view time and shorter fixation duration, with a significant difference between semantic and syntactic errors. By identifying the visual attention differences and tendencies associated with successful detection tasks and the investigation of semantic and syntactic errors, we highlight the non-polarity of the ‘scale’ of expertise and allow clear recommendations for curriculum development and training methods.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 827
EP  - 845
VL  - 46
IS  - 4
AB  - Previous studies on Korean relative clauses (RC) show that, with respect to processing, object-extracted relative clauses (ORC) are more difficult to process at the head noun than subject-extracted relative clauses within temporarily ambiguous contexts. ORCs, however, are predicted by experience-based processing models to incur a greater processing cost during early processing stages at the RC verb, since it is a likely locus of disambiguation for RCs in Korean, and because ORCs are a less frequent structure. Consequently, the current study investigates whether processing difficulty for ORCs manifests itself at the RC verb using eye-tracking methods, a simple sentence structure and a sentential-decision task. The results revealed significantly increased go-past reading times for ORCs at the RC verb. We believe this is a result of a less frequent structure being more difficult to parse during disambiguation. Accordingly, experience-based models of processing can accurately predict difficulty for ORCs in Korean.

JO  - Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing
SP  - 243
EP  - 258
VL  - 16
IS  - 4
AB  - Objective.Currently, vital parameters are commonly displayed as trends along a timeline. However, clinical decisions are more often based upon concepts, such as the depth of anesthesia, that are derived by combining parameter relationships and additional context information. The current displays do not visualize such concepts and therefore do not optimally support the decision process. A new display should present an ecological interface (EI). The principle of EI design is to visualize all of the information necessary for decision making in one single display. Methods.In the first approach, we developed an EI that visualizes 35 relevant parameters for anesthesia monitoring. All of the parameters are generated by an anesthesia software simulator. Sixteen anesthetists had to administer two simulated general anesthetics: in one setting working only with the simulator's monitors (“SimOnly”), and in another setting working with the simulator's monitors in combination with the EI (“Combi1”).During each experiment, one unexpected critical incident (either blood loss or a cuff leakage) had to be identified. The control and monitoring behavior was analyzed by recording the subjects' eye movements and think-a loud protocol. With the help of the eye-tracking results, we re-designed the EI. The new EI was then tested with no eye tracking (“Combi2”) on eight anesthetists under analogous conditions as in “Combi1.”Results.Cuff leakage was identified significantly quicker in“Combi1” (7 of 8 cases; time (T): 65 s ± 73 s)than in “SimOnly” (6 of 8 cases; T: 222 s ±187 s). Blood loss was identified in 5 of 8 cases (T: 215 s± 76 s) in “Combi1” as quickly as in“SimOnly” (all cases; T: 217 s ± 72 s). In“Combi1,” the EI was used as the main source of information (in43 ± 19% of time) and was frequently favored when identifying an evolving critical incident. In “Combi2,” cuff leakage was identified in 7 of 8 cases (T: 70s ± 111s) as quickly as in“Combi1.” Blood loss was identified significantly quicker in all cases (T: 147 s ± 62 s) in “Combi2” than in“Combi1” and in “SimOnly.” Conclusion.The results have shown that appropriately designed EIs may improve the anesthetist's decision making and focus attention on specific problems. Now, the findings have to be tested in future studies by widening the scope using other simulated scenarios and being closer to reality under real conditions in the OR. Eye tracking proved to be a useful method to analyze the anesthetists' decision making and appropriately re-designinter faces.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Twenty qualified mission-ready F-16 pilots participated in this research. The ages of participants are between 26 and 46 years old (M=33, SD=6); total flying hours between 400 and 3,250 hours (M=1358, SD=882); F-16 type flying hours between 101 and 2,270 hours (M=934, SD=689). Eye movement data were collected by a head-mounted ASL (Applied Science Laboratory) Mobile Eye which was 76 grams in weight, combined with F-16 flight simulator, a dynamic high fidelity trainer that replicates actual aircraft performance, navigation and weapon systems. The scenario is an air-to-surface task. Participants have to intercept the proper route and turn toward the target at an altitude of 500 feet with speed of 500-KIAS, then performing a steep pop-up manoeuver to increase altitude abruptly for appropriate reconnaissance, following by dive and roll-in toward the target to avoid hostile radar lock-on. When approaching the target, subjects have to roll-out, level the aircraft, aiming at the target, release the weapon, and finally pull-up with a 5 ~ 5.5 G-force to break-away from the range. The results show significant differences in pilots’ number of gaze points among five different AOIs, F (4, 95) = 533.84, p<.001, η2ρ = .97. Further comparisons using post-hoc Bonferroni adjusted tests showed HUD has a significantly higher numbers of gaze points than ICP, DED, RMFD and LMFD; and ICP has significantly higher gaze points than DED, RMFD and LMFD. Also, there were significant differences in pilots’ number of fixation among five different AOIs, F (4, 95) = 306.98, p<.001, η2ρ =.94. Further comparisons using post-hoc Bonferroni adjusted tests showed HUD has significantly higher number of fixation than ICP, DED, RMFD and LMFD; and ICP has significantly higher number of fixations than DED, RMFD and LMFD. Pilots have to be able to ‘see and process’ the information to understand the situation, and then, to ‘project’ the situation in the near future. There is a long-standing argument concerning bottom-up or top-down visual processes in the eye movement literature. It is observed in this research that pilots applied both bottom-up and top-down visual processes, depending on the salience of information or previous experience.

TI  - Modeling cognitive load and physiological arousal through pupil diameter and heart rate
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - This study investigates individuals’ cognitive load processing abilities while engaged on a decision-making task in serious games, to explore how a substantial cognitive load dominates over the physiological arousal effect on pupil diameter. A serious game was presented to the participants, which displayed the on–line biofeedback based on physiological measurements of arousal. In such dynamic decision-making environment, the pupil diameter was analyzed in relation to the heart rate, to evaluate if the former could be a useful measure of cognitive abilities of individuals. As pupil might reflect both cognitive activity and physiological arousal, the pupillary response will show an arousal effect only when the cognitive demands of the situation are minimal. Evidence shows that in a situation where a substantial level of cognitive activity is required, only that activity will be observable on the pupil diameter, dominating over the physiological arousal effect indicated by the pupillary response. It is suggested that it might be possible to design serious games tailored to the cognitive abilities of an individual player, using the proposed physiological measurements to observe the moment when such dominance occurs.

AB  - Documenting, specifying and analyzing complex domains such as information systems or business processes have become unimaginable without the support of graphical models. Generally, models are developed using graph-oriented languages such as Event Driven Process Chains (EPC) or diagrams of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). For industrial use, modeling languages aim to describe either information systems or business processes. Heterogeneous modeling languages allow different grades of usability to their users. In the following chapter an evaluation of four heterogeneous modeling languages and their different impact on user performance and user satisfaction is conducted [Schalles et al., 2012]. The evaluation is based on the FUEML framework, which was developed in chapter 4 of this thesis.

TI  - Template Construction Grammar: From Visual Scene Description to Language Comprehension and Agrammatism
JO  - Neuroinformatics
SP  - 181
EP  - 208
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - How does the language system coordinate with our visual system to yield flexible integration of linguistic, perceptual, and world-knowledge information when we communicate about the world we perceive? Schema theory is a computational framework that allows the simulation of perceptuo-motor coordination programs on the basis of known brain operating principles such as cooperative computation and distributed processing. We present first its application to a model of language production, SemRep/TCG, which combines a semantic representation of visual scenes (SemRep) with Template Construction Grammar (TCG) as a means to generate verbal descriptions of a scene from its associated SemRep graph. SemRep/TCG combines the neurocomputational framework of schema theory with the representational format of construction grammar in a model linking eye-tracking data to visual scene descriptions. We then offer a conceptual extension of TCG to include language comprehension and address data on the role of both world knowledge and grammatical semantics in the comprehension performances of agrammatic aphasic patients. This extension introduces a distinction between heavy and light semantics. The TCG model of language comprehension offers a computational framework to quantitatively analyze the distributed dynamics of language processes, focusing on the interactions between grammatical, world knowledge, and visual information. In particular, it reveals interesting implications for the understanding of the various patterns of comprehension performances of agrammatic aphasics measured using sentence-picture matching tasks. This new step in the life cycle of the model serves as a basis for exploring the specific challenges that neurolinguistic computational modeling poses to the neuroinformatics community.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of the research in bilingual figurative language processing. It starts with reviewing different types of figurative language and the importance it has for revealing the mechanisms underlying language processing in general. As research into how bilinguals process figurative language is largely an extension of the research questions explored in the monolingual literature, the chapter next discusses models developed to account for how native language (L1) speakers store and process figurative language. The chapter then summarizes the still limited studies into L2 (nonnative) and bilingual figurative processing and identifies major research themes that have been explored through off-line and online behavioral, electrophysiological, and eye-tracking studies which looked at how nonnative language users acquire, store, and retrieve different figurative tropes.

TI  - Comparing eye movements during mathematical word problem solving in Chinese and German
JO  - ZDM
AB  - Language plays an important role in word problem solving. Accordingly, the language in which a word problem is presented could affect its solution process. In particular, East-Asian, non-alphabetic languages are assumed to provide specific benefits for mathematics compared to Indo-European, alphabetic languages. By analyzing students’ eye movements in a cross-linguistic comparative study, we analyzed word problem solving processes in Chinese and German. 72 German and 67 Taiwanese undergraduate students solved PISA word problems in their own language. Results showed differences in eye movements of students, between the two languages. Moreover, independent cluster analyses revealed three clusters of reading patterns based on eye movements in both languages. Corresponding reading patterns emerged in both languages that were similarly and significantly associated with performance and motivational-affective variables. They explained more variance among students in these variables than between the languages alone. Our analyses show that eye movements of students during reading differ between the two languages, but very similar reading patterns exist in both languages. This result supports the assumption that the language alone is not a sufficient explanation for differences in students’ mathematical achievement, but that reading patterns are more strongly related to performance.

VL  - 50
IS  - 6
AB  - During adolescence, youth may experience heightened attention bias to socially relevant stimuli; however, it is unclear if attention bias toward social threat may be exacerbated for adolescents with a history of anxiety. This study evaluated attentional bias during the Chatroom-Interact task with 25 adolescents with a history of anxiety (18F, Mage = 13.6) and 22 healthy adolescents (13F, Mage = 13.8). In this task, participants received feedback from fictional, virtual peers who either chose them (acceptance) or rejected them (rejection). Overall, participants were faster to orient toward and spent longer time dwelling on their own picture after both rejection and acceptance compared to non-feedback cues. Social feedback was associated with greater pupillary reactivity, an index of cognitive and emotional neural processing, compared to non-feedback cues. During acceptance feedback (but not during rejection feedback), anxious youth displayed greater pupil response compared to healthy youth, suggesting that positive feedback from peers may differentially influence youth with a history of an anxiety disorder.

TI  - QoE of cross-modally mapped Mulsemedia: an assessment using eye gaze and heart rate
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - A great deal of research effort has been put in exploring crossmodal correspondences in the field of cognitive science which refer to the systematic associations frequently made between different sensory modalities (e.g. high pitch is matched with angular shapes). However, the possibilities cross-modality opens in the digital world have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, we consider that studying the plasticity and the effects of crossmodal correspondences in a mulsemedia setup can bring novel insights about improving the human-computer dialogue and experience. Mulsemedia refers to the combination of three or more senses to create immersive experiences. In our experiments, users were shown six video clips associated with certain visual features based on color, brightness, and shape. We examined if the pairing with crossmodal matching sound and the corresponding auto-generated haptic effect, and smell would lead to an enhanced user QoE. For this, we used an eye-tracking device as well as a heart rate monitor wristband to capture users’ eye gaze and heart rate whilst they were experiencing mulsemedia. After each video clip, we asked the users to complete an on-screen questionnaire with a set of questions related to smell, sound and haptic effects targeting their enjoyment and perception of the experiment. Accordingly, the eye gaze and heart rate results showed significant influence of the cross-modally mapped multisensorial effects on the users’ QoE. Our results highlight that when the olfactory content is crossmodally congruent with the visual content, the visual attention of the users seems shifted towards the correspondent visual feature. Crosmodally matched media is also shown to result in an enhanced QoE compared to a video only condition.

AB  - Reading involves the orchestration of many information-processing stages; as the eyes move across the printed page, the visual features of the text are converted into orthographic and phonological patterns, which are then used to guide further language processing so that the content of the text can be understood. One can gain an appreciation of the complexity of these processes by examining the table of contents in a psychology of reading textbook; minimally, one finds chapters devoted to the topics of eye movement control, word recognition, semantic and syntactic analyses, and discourse processing (Just and Carpenter, 1987; Perfetti, 1985; Rayner and Pollatsek, 1989; Taylor and Taylor, 1983).

Workshop dealt with the comparison of BPMN and BORM process modelling tools in the form of Usability study. We practically presented the methods used to compare, defined the appropriate equipment of the laboratory and proposed the CASE study model. We hired participants (from the audience) and we used Tobii Glasses for eyes tracking and recording the participants focus. This technology has been used by authors in previous years to find a measure of quality of process models, and this year has been demonstrated and applied on BPMN and DEMO models.

JO  - Experimental Brain Research
SP  - 69
EP  - 77
VL  - 233
IS  - 1
AB  - Recent studies have shown that anticipatory eye movements occur during both action observation and action execution. These findings strongly support the direct matching hypothesis, which states that in observing others’ actions, people take advantage of the same action knowledge that enables them to perform the same actions. Furthermore, a connection between action experience and the ability to anticipate action goals has been proposed. Concerning the role of experience, most studies concentrated on motor experts such as athletes and musicians, whereas only few studies investigated whether motor programs can be activated by short-term experience. Applying a pre–post design, we examined whether short-term experience affects anticipatory eye movements during observation. Participants (N = 150 university students) observed scenes showing an actor performing a block stacking task. Subsequently, participants performed either a block stacking task, puzzles, or a pursuit rotor task. Afterward, participants were again provided with the aforementioned block stacking task scenes. Results revealed that the block stacking task group directed their gaze significantly earlier toward the action goals of the block stacking task during posttest trials, compared with Puzzle and pursuit rotor task groups, which did not differ from each other. In accordance with the direct matching hypothesis, our study provides evidence that short-term experience with the block stacking task activates task-specific action knowledge.

AB  - This chapter provides an introduction into neurophysiological tools that we consider to be relevant in IS research. We focus on tools that have been used in NeuroIS research or that hold use potential for future studies. Specifically, we discuss measurement of the central nervous system (fMRI, MRI, fNIRS, EEG), measurement of the peripheral nervous system (electrocardiogram, galvanometer, electromyography, oculometry), and measurement of the hormone system (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline, oxytocin). We outline the major advantages and disadvantages of each tool, and provide an example research study to give an authentic impression of each tool in the context of IS research.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this Chapter we consider eye movements and, in particular, the resulting sequence of gaze shifts to be the observable outcome of a stochastic process. Crucially, we show that, under such assumption, a wide variety of tools become available for analyses and modelling beyond conventional statistical methods. Such tools encompass random walk analyses and more complex techniques borrowed from the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning fields. After a brief, though critical, probabilistic tour of current computational models of eye movements and visual attention, we lay down the basis for gaze shift pattern analysis. To this end, the concepts of Markov Processes, the Wiener process and related random walks within the Gaussian framework of the Central Limit Theorem will be introduced. Then, we will deliberately violate fundamental assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem to elicit a larger perspective, rooted in statistical physics, for analysing and modelling eye movements in terms of anomalous, non-Gaussian, random walks and modern foraging theory. Eventually, by resorting to Statistical Machine Learning techniques, we discuss how the analyses of movement patterns can develop into the inference of hidden patterns of the mind: inferring the observer’s task, assessing cognitive impairments, classifying expertise.

AB  - This chapter argues that corpus-based translation studies and translation cognition research, the two branches of translation studies, are interrelated and complementary, and can converge to give birth to a new research area of translation studies: corpus-based translation cognition research. Corpus-based translation cognition research not only broadens the scope of corpus-based translation studies but also promotes related studies in translation cognition research by allowing researchers to go beyond the textual analysis and to carry out the study of the translation process or translation cognition. It thus can add to the research of CTS in areas of metaphor, cognition processes in translation, and the translator’s aesthetic psychology and cultural psychology. The use of a corpus methodology in translation cognition research can also help us identify the features of typical lexicons and syntactic structures that cannot be detected with the naked human eye.

AB  - Flight activities are highly dynamic operating processes. When pilots carry out missions, the information is primarily obtained through visual search. This study applied an eye-tracking system to collect empirical and objective data of 18 qualified and in-service F-16 flight aircraft pilots executing air-to-surface tasks. The results indicate that pilots with superior flight performance exhibited a longer fixation duration and more fixation counts with more stable scanpaths and a shorter distance compared with those with inferior performance when executing air-to-surface tasks. Additionally, pilots process messages through a top-down and bottom-up composite pattern during executing tasks. Regardless of the flight experience and performance, the pilots’ pupil size exhibited an identical tendency of variation. We suggest adding the eye-tracking system to the flight-simulator platform and providing immediate feedback to pilots and the pilot’s attention allocation and cognitive abilities should be considered in training courses to enhance flight safety and improve training performance.

AB  - In this article, we focus on capturing an expert’s experiences using wearable sensors. For this, first, we outline a set of high-level tasks that facilitate the transfer of experience from an expert to a trainee. Next, we define a mapping strategy to associate each task with one or more low-level functions such as gaze, voice, video, body posture, hand/arm gestures, biosignals, fatigue levels, haptic feedback, and location of the user in the environment. These low-level functions are then decomposed to their associated state-of-the-art sensors. Based on the requirements and constraints associated with the use cases from three different industrial partners, a set of sensors are proposed for the experience-capturing prototype. Finally, we discuss the attributes and features of the proposed prototype, along with its key challenges, constraints, and possible future directions.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 661
EP  - 714
VL  - 46
IS  - 3
AB  - The current study tackles a long standing question of whether comprehenders perform structural revision when it is not forced by grammar or not. Using an eye-tracking reading paradigm, we addressed this issue by making use of global structural ambiguity in Japanese. Our results show that comprehenders initially associate a relative clause with the first potential head noun and that they revise this analysis when the second noun is lexico-semantically possible as the relative clause head, but do not when it is impossible. The results are incompatible with the Revision as Last Resort hypothesis. Instead, they support the parsing with unforced revision that is immediately sensitive to lexical properties. We argue that our results cannot be accounted for by serial modular processing models but that they can be explained by ranked-parallel interactive processing models. Furthermore, we propose that head-finality is a key factor involved in the availability of unforced revision.

JO  - Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning
SP  - 21
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - The ability for metacognitive thought, or “thinking about thinking,” is recognized as an increasingly important skill for the future enrichment of social life. However, this skill is difficult to teach because it involves implicit cognitive activities that cannot be perceived by an outside observer. In this study, we propose an interpretation framework of metacognition as one approach to considering metacognitive thinking processes. This framework serves as the design principles for developing a system that makes it possible to provide metacognitive interpretations of gaze behaviors and thought operation actions and provides a common basis for sharing and comparing knowledge from analysis results. In this study, for an example of framework-based system development, we construct a thinking externalization application and thinking analysis support system with a thinking task of dissolving belief conflict as the theme. We also demonstrate an example of the analysis of thinking about belief conflict, as derived from lower-level and higher-level thinking interpretation rules. From the example results of the defined interpretation rules, we found that the desired behavior occurred, demonstrating the postulated possibility of capturing the thought process. By realizing a series of phases on the framework proposed in this paper, it contributes to the feasibility of grasping the metacognition process and accumulating knowledge about it.

AB  - Intelligent software must frequently interrupt users, but the problem of deciding when to interrupt the user is still unsolved. In this paper, an algorithm is presented that identifies the appropriate times to interrupt the user is proposed and visualizations of the user’s state. The Intelligent Interruption Algorithm draws from user, task, and environmental contextual information dynamically extracted from the environment as the user performs computer based tasks. The visualizations are a representation of these complex components presented in a way that is meaningful for analysis purposes and for the user. This paper presents the following: the interruption algorithm; the machine learning algorithms used; and the preliminary results of visualizing the interruptible moment.

SP  - 429
EP  - 451
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Visualizations based on circular shapes are oftentimes referred to as radial representations in the literature. Radial diagrams have recently gained increasing popularity in many application domains. One reason for this popularity is the aesthetic look of those diagrams. However, there are advantages for corresponding Cartesian (rectangular) representations as well, including possible perceptual benefits, more efficient use of rectangular screen space, or ease of implementation due to simpler graphical primitives. We describe several examples of visualizations that exist in Cartesian or radial form, and we discuss their respective benefits and drawbacks. We focus on the evaluation of those diagrams by comparative user studies. In particular, we consider how quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including eye tracking, can be employed to analyze which of the two visual mapping approaches is more suitable for given datasets and tasks.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Practical experience suggests that usage and understanding of UML diagrams is greatly affected by the quality of their layout. While existing research failed to provide conclusive evidence in support of this hypothesis, our own previous work provided substantial evidence to this effect. When studying different factors like diagram type and expertise level, it became apparent that diagram size plays an important role, too. Since we lack an adequate understanding of this notion, in this paper, we define diagram size metrics and study their impact to modeler performance. We find that there is a strong negative correlation between diagram size and modeler performance. Our results are highly significant. We utilize these results to derive a recommendation on diagram sizes that are optimal for model understanding.

Three approaches to deriving wearable technology-based metrics are explored: (1) eye tracking, (2) psychophysiological measurements [e.g. electrodermal activity (EDA)] and (3) arm and hand movement via accelerometry. We also measure attentional capacity by tasking the operator with an additional task to track an unrelated object during the procedure.

SP  - 263

VL  - 45
IS  - 2
AB  - Textbooks in applied mathematics often use graphs to explain the meaning of formulae, even though their benefit is still not fully explored. To test processes underlying this assumed multimedia effect we collected performance scores, eye movements, and think-aloud protocols from students solving problems in vector calculus with and without graphs. Results showed no overall multimedia effect, but instead an effect to confirm statements that were accompanied by graphs, irrespective of whether these statements were true or false. Eye movement and verbal data shed light on this surprising finding. Students looked proportionally less at the text and the problem statement when a graph was present. Moreover, they experienced more mental effort with the graph, as indicated by more silent pauses in thinking aloud. Hence, students actively processed the graphs. This, however, was not sufficient. Further analysis revealed that the more students looked at the statement, the better they performed. Thus, in the multimedia condition the graph drew students’ attention and cognitive capacities away from focusing on the statement. A good alternative strategy in the multimedia condition was to frequently look between graph and problem statement, and thus to integrate their information. In conclusion, graphs influence where students look and what they process, and may even mislead them into believing accompanying information. Thus, teachers and textbook designers should be very critical on when to use graphs and carefully consider how the graphs are integrated with other parts of the problem.

TI  - Attention Guidance Strategies for Supporting Learning from Dynamic Visualizations
BT  - Learning from Dynamic Visualization: Innovations in Research and Application
SP  - 255
EP  - 278
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Learning from dynamic visualizations can pose distinct perceptual and cognitive processing challenges to learners that hinder those who lack relevant domain knowledge in making optimal choices about what information in the dynamic display should be attended to. Such learners therefore likely miss the essential information required for developing an accurate and complete understanding of the depicted content. As a result, attention guidance strategies, which have long been a feature of static educational visualizations, have been the subject of increasing interest from researchers as a means of helping learners to extract task-relevant information from a dynamic visualization. This chapter discusses three different approaches to attention guidance that have been explored in research on learning from dynamic visualizations: (1) cueing, (2) eye movement modeling examples, and (3) gesturing. For each of these types of attention guidance, the main findings from empirical research regarding its effects on perceptual and cognitive processing of a dynamic visualization are discussed. These findings suggest that attention guidance can engender more appropriate forms of attention direction. However, the extent to which attention guidance facilitates perceptual and/or cognitive processing depends on the approach taken to guide learners’ attention. Implications for research as well as for the design and practical use of attention guidance strategies to increase effective learning from dynamic visualizations are discussed.

VL  - 45

AB  - This study investigates preverbal structural and semantic processing in Japanese, a head-final language, using the maze task. Two sentence types were tested—simple scrambled sentences (Experiment 1) and control sentences (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that even for simple, mono-clausal Japanese sentences, (1) there are online processing costs associated with parsing noncanonical word orders and (2) these costs are incurred during the incremental integration of constituents into developing sentence representations. Experiment 2 indicated (1) that antecedents are provisionally assigned to empty subjects in Japanese control sentences before verb information becomes available and (2) that this process is guided by an object control bias. Taken together, these findings are interpreted to suggest an important role for preverbal analysis in the processing of displaced constituents and of referential properties for empty elements in head-final languages.

SP  - 2795

VL  - 23
IS  - 5
AB  - Program comprehension is an important skill for programmers – extending and debugging existing source code is part of the daily routine. Syntax highlighting is one of the most common tools used to support developers in understanding algorithms. However, most research in this area originates from a time when programmers used a completely different tool chain. We examined the influence of syntax highlighting on novices’ ability to comprehend source code. Additional analyses cover the influence of task type and programming experience on the code comprehension ability itself and its relation to syntax highlighting. We conducted a controlled experiment with 390 undergraduate students in an introductory Java programming course. We measured the correctness with which they solved small coding tasks. Each test subject received some tasks with syntax highlighting and some without. The data provided no evidence that syntax highlighting improves novices’ ability to comprehend source code. There are very few similar experiments and it is unclear as of yet which factors impact the effectiveness of syntax highlighting. One major limitation may be the types of tasks chosen for this experiment. The results suggest that syntax highlighting squanders a feedback channel from the IDE to the programmer that can be used more effectively.

AB  - With the increasing use of in-vehicle devices in cars, an understanding of the safety implications of secondary tasks has become crucial. It is now possible to study the effects of many in-vehicle devices and tasks on driving by using head-mounted eye-tracking devices (HEDs) to collect eye positions and pupil diameters, which have been considered indicators of attentional focus. The collection of eye-position and pupil-diameter data of automobile drivers under on-road conditions and while completing various secondary tasks is described in this paper. Drivers were asked to drive on a preselected two-lane road for a total distance of 22 miles while gaze data were recorded using a HED. Longer off-road fixation durations were observed in radio-tuning and rearview mirror checking tasks, but not in the odometer checking task. In addition, the standard deviations of fixation displacements during a cognitive task involving the computation of a date for a meeting were shorter than those observed during normal driving.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - I marshal several lines of empirical support for the claim that the human sentence processing mechanism (HSPM) constructs representations of the syntactic structures of linguistic stimuli—what I call “mental phrase markers” (MPMs). Powerful neurocognitive evidence for this hypothesis is drawn from recent EEG and MEG studies. Further support comes from studies of structural priming and garden-path processing, which provide insight into the structure of MPMs. Structural priming involves modulating the speed of behavioral responses by exciting certain MPMs prior to a task. In the case of garden-path processing, the HSPM encounters a locally ambiguous input and resolves the ambiguity in a way that turns out to be incorrect. The principles of ambiguity resolution that are operative in such cases all seem to make direct ineliminable reference to MPMs. Finally, I discuss various attempts to demonstrate the psychological reality of so-called “empty categories”. The available evidence suggests that wh-traces are psychologically real and that the HSPM employs sophisticated strategies in searching for them, making use of both grammatical constraints and cues provided by their antecedents. In the concluding section, I discuss whether the contents of MPMs can help us decide which grammar the HSPM employs in on-line processing.

AB  - The main goal of this work is to evaluate the feasibility to calculate the technical debt (a traditional software quality approach) in a model-driven context through the same tools used by software developers at work. The SonarQube tool was used, so that the quality check was performed directly on projects created with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) instead of traditionals source code projects. In this work, XML was used as the model specification language to verify in SonarQube due to the creation of EMF metamodels in XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) and that SonarQube offers a plugin to assess the XML language. After this, our work focused on the definition of model rules as an XSD schema (XML Schema Definition) and the integration between EMF-SonarQube in order that these metrics were directly validated by SonarQube; and subsequently, this tool determined the technical debt that the analyzed EMF models could contain.

TI  - A Hierarchical Linear Modeling Analysis of Working Memory and Implicit Prosody in the Resolution of Adjunct Attachment Ambiguity
JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 491
EP  - 509
VL  - 38
IS  - 5
AB  - An eye-movement monitoring experiment investigated readers’ response to temporarily ambiguous sentences. The sentences were ambiguous because a relative clause could attach to one of two preceding nouns. Semantic information disambiguated the sentences. Working memory considerations predict an overall preference for the second of the two nouns, as does the late closure principle (Frazier, On comprehending sentences: Syntactic parsing strategies. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Connecticut. West Bend, IN: Indiana University Linguistics Club, 1979). Previous studies assessing preferences for such items have obtained mixed results. On-line assessments show that working memory affects the degree of preference for the first noun, with lower capacity readers having a greater preference for the second noun (Felser et al., Language Acquisition: A Journal of Developmental Linguistics, 11, 127–163, 2003; Traxler, Memory & Cognition, 35, 1107–1121, 2007). Off-line assessments indicate the opposite pattern of preferences when the test sentences are displayed on a single line (Swets et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, 64–81, 2007). However, when implicit prosody is manipulated by displaying the sentences with a break between the second noun and the relative clause, the off-line assessments indicate that readers prefer to attach the relative clause to the first noun. In this experiment, readers’ undertook a working memory assessment and then read test sentences that were displayed across two lines, with a break appearing after the second noun and before the relative clause. The eye-tracking data indicated an overall preference to attach the relative clause to the first noun, and there was little indication that working memory moderated the degree of preference for this configuration. Hence, it appears that readers’ implicit prosodic contours rapidly affect resolution of adjunct attachment ambiguities.

AB  - User-system interactions (e.g., mouse clicks and movements) can be logged with the uLog computer program. A Web-based study with 20 participants was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using uLog data as an indicator of workload and attention. Eye fixation, heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance were used to unveil users’ workload and attention and, hence, to validate uLog data as indicators of these. Results on one of the Tasks did indeed show correlations between uLog data and HRV. This is a promising first step toward the validation of uLog mouse data as indicators of workload and attention.

JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
SP  - 529
EP  - 540
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze pilots’ visual scanning under conditions visually restricted by the occlusion paradigm. During manual flight, pilots experienced interruptions in their panel scan due to concurring tasks and monitoring of distant displays. Eleven volunteer airline pilots performed several manual instrument landing system approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Some of these approaches were performed using the paradigm of occlusion with shutter glasses. Under occlusion, the gaze pattern analysis revealed that pilots demonstrated reduced mean glance durations, but did not reduce their attention to lesser information displays. The results also indicated that the attitude indicator (artificial horizon) as a preview instrument was less affected by occlusion compared to other areas of interest. A subsequent scanpath analysis revealed that vertical tracking was the predominant information acquisition strategy and corresponded to larger deviations on the glideslope. These results imply the need to optimize information even for short glances, and to be very cautious with adaptive layouts of free programmable or dynamic displays, and not to overburden the pilot flying with parallel tasks.

TI  - Scope Processing in Chinese
JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 11
VL  - 38
IS  - 1
AB  - The standard view maintains that quantifier scope interpretation results from an interaction between different modules: the syntax, the semantics as well as the pragmatics. Thus, by examining the mechanism of quantifier scope interpretation, we will certainly gain some insight into how these different modules interact with one another. To observe it, two experiments, an offline judgment task and an eye-tracking experiment, were conducted to investigate the interpretation of doubly quantified sentences in Chinese, like Mei-ge qiangdao dou qiang-le yi-ge yinhang (Every robber robbed a bank). According to current literature, doubly quantified sentences in Chinese like the above are unambiguous, which can only be interpreted as ‘for every robber x, there is a bank y, such that x robbed y–surface scope reading), contrary to their ambiguous English counterparts, which also allow the interpretation that ‘there is a bank y, such that for every robber x, x robbed y–inverse scope reading). Specifically, three questions were examined, that is, (i) What is the initial reading of doubly quantified sentences in Chinese? (ii) Whether inverse scope interpretation can be available if appropriate contexts are provided? (iii) What are the processing time courses engaged in quantifier scope interpretation? The results showed that (i) Initially, the language processor computes the surface scope representation and the inverse scope representation in parallel, thus, doubly quantified sentences in Chinese are ambiguous; (ii) The discourse information is not employed in initial processing of relative scope, it serves to evaluate the two representations in reanalysis; (iii) The lexical information of verbs affects their scope-taking patterns. We suggest that these findings provide evidence for the Modular Model, one of the major contenders in the literature on sentence processing.

EP  - 242
VL  - 36
IS  - 4
AB  - In this paper we examined plan continuation error (PCE), a well known error made by pilots consisting in continuing the flight plan despite adverse meteorological conditions. Our hypothesis is that a large range of strong negative emotional consequences, including those induced by economic pressure, are associated with the decision to revise the flight plan and favor PCE. We investigated the economic hypothesis with a simplified landing task (reproduction of a real aircraft instrument) in which uncertainty and reward were manipulated. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and eye tracking measurements were performed to get objective clues both on the cognitive and emotional state of the volunteers. Results showed that volunteers made more risky decisions under the influence of the financial incentive, in particular when uncertainty was high. Psychophysiological examination showed that HR increased and total HRV decreased in response to the cognitive load generated by the task. In addition, HR also increased in response to the financially motivated condition. Eventually, fixation times increased when uncertainty was high, confirming the difficulty in obtaining/interpreting information from the instrument in this condition. These results support the assumption that risky-decision making observed in pilots can be, at least partially, explained by a shift from cold to hot (emotional) decision-making in response to economic constraints and uncertainty.

AB  - In order to better understand which factors play a role in non-adaptive social behavior in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) we looked into physiological arousal and awareness of one’s own emotions. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured during a public speaking task in 51 young adults with ASD and 28 typically developing (TD) controls. The results showed no significant group differences in baseline HR/HRV, HR reactivity (change from baseline to the speaking task) or self-reported emotional awareness. However, adults with ASD showed significantly lower HRV reactivity (p = .023, d = 0.6) compared to TD adults. These results suggest a mismatch between arousal regulation and emotional awareness, which may be related to problems in social adaptation in ASD.

AB  - In the last couple of years, the interest in remote tower operation systems has increased, as a concept to provide cost-efficient air traffic control service to airports. Attempts are made to stretch the concept to enable multiple remote tower control. A couple of challenges have been identified that need to be mitigated to make the concept feasible. For instance, studies revealed the disadvantage of reduced quality of the video panorama and an increased dispersion of information gathering. Design concepts were derived from the top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of human information processing to support multiple remote tower. These concepts could potentially mitigate the negative effects of a reduced quality of the video panorama and also the dispersion of information gathering. This paper focusses on the reduced quality of the video panorama and uses these design concepts to implement three visual assistance systems. These systems were tested within a laboratory experiment with 40 participants for effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, situation awareness, and workload. The microworld FAirControl was used to simulate an air traffic control monitoring task at a single airport. First, the visual assistance systems were compared against the baseline to assess the improvement of each system. Second, in an explorative approach, the visual assistance systems were compared to identify the advantages and disadvantages against each other. The results show that visual assistance systems can mitigate the influence of the quality-reduced video panorama. The results also indicate that usability of the visual assistance systems is crucial. Participant selective information overlay had the best overall performance.

AB  - Objective.Comprehensive monitoring of the patient state andsubsequent decision making is an essential part of the task of ananaesthetist. The physicians' decision making process is based upon aconcept of partly abstract physiologic parameters such as depth of anaesthesiaor contractility. This concept is derived from the measured parameters givenon todays' trend displays in addition to context information availablefor the anaesthetist. We investigated two alternative approaches of displaydesign for hemodynamic monitoring: 1) integrated displays based on ecologicalinterface design, and 2) profilogram displays based on intelligent alarms.Method.To evaluate differences in decision making, the two displaysand a trend display were compared in an experimental set-up with computersimulated vital parameter curves. From a start state with random parameterdeviations from the ideal state, subjects had to achieve the ideal circulatoryperformance as fast as possible by manipulating vasomotor tone, heart rate,blood volume and contractility. To analyse subjects' decision makingprocess, eye-tracking, event-logging, and the method of think aloud protocolswere used. Twenty anaesthesiologists performed 113 experiments (approximately2 with each display). Results.The anaesthetists failed to achieve thetask in 37% using the trend display, in 19% using the profilogram display, andin 13% using the ecological interface. Hence, a safer task solution waspossible with the ecological interface and the profilogram display but at theexpense of various performance parameters such as higher trial time, moreinteractions with the simulated system, and more frequent eye movements. Incontrast to the trend display and the profilogram display, where anaesthetistswere mainly focussed on controlling the left atrial pressure, such anbehaviour was less observed with the ecological interface. Conclusion.Our results have shown that subjects came to more effective solutions withthe traditional trend display. The main reason for this result may be theiryears of experience with this kind of display type. Regarding safe andgoal-intended decision finding, the results are encouraging for furtherexperiments with redesigned ecological displays. But these displays ought tohave smoother changes with respect to the traditional trend displays.Furthermore, new experiments have to be performed under real or fairly real(e.g. together with an anaesthesia simulator) conditions to underline thepositive results for ecological interfaces.

PB  - Springer New York

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of bilingualism research on visual word recognition in sentence context and relates this work to task-specific context factors. Many studies examining bilingual word recognition out-of-context have shown that words from both languages become activated when reading in one language (i.e., language-nonselective lexical access). A recent research line investigated whether presentation of words in a sentence context, providing a language cue and/or semantic constraint to restrict lexical access to words in the target language, modulates this language-nonselective activation. Recent lexical decision, translation, naming, and eye-tracking studies suggest that the language of the sentence context cannot restrict lexical access to words of the target language. Eye-tracking studies revealed that semantic constraint of a sentence does not necessarily restrict language-nonselective access, although there is evidence that it has a relatively late effect, and that it affects language-nonselective activation in lexical decision, translation, and naming studies.

AB  - Through the analysis of major fatal accidents occurred within 30 years from 1986 to 2016 in China’s coal mines, it reflects that human errors accounting for up to 80% of the total accidents. The coal mines have set up a variety of safety signs that can alert miners to be careful with the insecurity in the workplace, and guide them to behave safely in accordance with legal standards. However, the human-induced accidents still occur. The problem is that although the safety signs have been adopted universally in the coal mines as a kind of management strategy, they are hard to play the safety signs’ due role in the practical application. The low effectiveness of safety signs is one of the important reasons for the coal mines accidents. In order to settle the practical problems and improve the safety level of coal mines, this research is designed to study the effectiveness of safety signs in coal mines.

AB  - This paper describes a research infrastructure setup to exercise and investigate guidance and control capabilities under human and autonomous control modalities. The lab facility is designed to implement tasks that emphasize agent-environment interactions. The overall goal is to characterize these interactions and to apply the gained knowledge to determine interaction models. These can then be used to design guidance and control algorithms as well as human–machine systems. The facility uses miniature rotorcraft as test vehicles with a Vicon motion tracking system and SensoMotoric gaze tracking system. The facility also includes a high-fidelity simulation system to support larger scale autonomy and teleoperation experiments. The simulation incorporates the software components and models of the key flight hardware and sensors. The software system was integrated around the Robotics Operating System (ROS) to support the heterogenous processes and data and allow easy system reconfiguration. The paper describes the research objectives, details of the hardware and software components and their integration, and concludes with a summary of the ongoing research enabled by the lab facility including.

AB  - When faced with a difficult decision, it would be nice to have access to a model that shows the essence of what others did in the same situation. Such a model should show what, and in which sequence, needs to be done so that alternatives can be correctly determined and criterions can be carefully considered. To make it trustworthy, the model should be mined from a large number of previous instances of similar decisions. Our decision-process mining framework aims to capture, in logs, the processes of large numbers of individuals and extract meaningful models from those logs. This paper shows how individual decision data models can be aggregated into a single model and how less frequent behavior can be removed from the aggregated model. We also argue that main process mining algorithms perform poorly on decision logs.

AB  - A wearable device for capturing 3D gaze information in indoor and outdoor environments is proposed. The hardware and software architecture of the device provides an estimate in quasi-real-time of 2.5D points of regard (POR) and then lift their estimations to 3D, by projecting them into the 3D reconstructed scene. The estimation procedure does not need any external device, and can be used both indoor and outdoor and with the subject wearing it moving, though some smooth constraint in the motion are required. To ensure a great flexibility with respect to depth a novel calibration method is proposed, which provides eye-scene calibration that explicitly takes into account depth information, in so ensuring a quite accurate estimation of the PORs. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that both 2.5D and 3D POR are accurately estimated.

AB  - This chapter provides a publications retrospective of NeuroIS topics, and outlines potential themes for future NeuroIS studies. We begin with a description of topics from 2007 NeuroIS publications, and then, based on research agendas and discussion papers, we present topics that can be investigated by applying neuroscience approaches. Next, we analyze the topics of one specific publication—the proceedings of the Gmunden Retreat on NeuroIS. Our identification of the research topics, and the neuroscience methods and tools presented in the proceedings, is based on analysis of 85 papers published between 2011 and 2014. We end the chapter by reflecting on applying neuroscience reference theories in NeuroIS research. Because current NeuroIS research rarely addresses the use of reference theories from neuroscience, this chapter suggests a taxonomy for neuroscience theories to promote such a discourse in NeuroIS research.

AB  - The field of language assessment has expanded its focus from making inferences based on performance outcome to examining cognitive processes involving structuring information for conceptual and procedural understandings necessary for successful assessment task completion. The quality of these inferences is subject to the extent to which tasks used to elicit mental processes are successfully performed. It is equally critical that the observed mental processes do not differ significantly from those taking place in nonobservational situations. The chapter reviews research on learner cognition through an examination of reading comprehension processes in testing situations. Subsequently, it discusses major contributions and theoretical, methodological, and contextual challenges in assessing learner cognition. The chapter highlights that learners’ cognitive capacity for executing tasks is best understood when they are viewed as a dynamic system. When assessment ignores such dynamic interplay of learners’ multiple traits, our evidentiary reasoning about their cognitive capabilities remains incomplete. I conclude the chapter with suggestions that will extend current research with technological advances.

AB  - The eyes move continually during visual processing, usually without explicit control or awareness, to scan the key features of a scene. This is essential to our ability to attend to multiple features of our environment and to extract useful information from complex visual stimuli. Eye movement abnormalities are a significant and reliable neurobehavioral marker for a number of major neurological, developmental, and psychiatric disorders, so enhanced understanding of how the brain controls eye movements can yield insights into the brain abnormalities at the root of these conditions.

AB  - Being able to predict how internet users react when confronted with a potentially dangerous call for action in an online message (such as an e-mail) is important for several reasons. On the one hand, users have to be protected from fraudulent e-mails such as phishing. On the other hand, over-cautious users would be difficult to communicate with on the internet, so senders of legitimate messages have to know how to convince recipients of the authenticity of their messages. Extensive research already exists from both of these perspectives, but each study only explores certain aspects of the complex system of factors influencing users’ reactions. In this paper the results of our efforts to integrate the various existing findings into one comprehensive model are presented, along with the results of a preliminary evaluation of some of the model’s predictions using quantitative as well as qualitative measures and eye-tracking.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Human-centred design is based on the satisfaction of the user needs mainly related to performances, interaction, comfort, usability, accessibility, and visibility issues. However, the “real” user experience (UX) is hidden and usually difficult to detect. The paper proposes a multimodal system based on the collection of physiological and anthropometrical performance data on field and within a mixed prototyping set-up. The mixed environment makes users interact with virtual and digital items and users’ performance to be capture and digitalized, simulating human-machine interaction, while physiological and anthropometrical data collection allows to objectify the users’ physical and mental workload during task execution. Such a system has been applied to an industrial case study focusing on agricultural machinery driving and control to support the definition of a new cabin and its control board, in terms of seat features, commands’ positioning and grouping, and positioning of additional devices.

AB  - In this chapter, we will describe how the analysis of eye movements can be used in the study of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying economic decision making. We will first introduce the area of neuroeconomics by describing relevant theories and methods. We will then demonstrate how oculographic methods have been used profitably in this field. While initially, considerable effort and energy had to be applied to find a common ground and language for the different disciplines involved in neuroeconomics, in recent years, testable hypotheses and models have developed within a common framework. These models have led to intriguing insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms leading up to economic decisions. We conclude that the field of neuroeconomics is a flourishing and fruitful endeavour and that especially the application of knowledge about the oculomotor system can make important contributions.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Despite their drawbacks, paper-based questionnaires are still used to collect data in many application domains. In the QuestionSys project, we develop an advanced framework that enables domain experts to transform paper-based instruments to mobile data collection applications, which then run on smart mobile devices. The framework empowers domain experts to develop robust mobile data collection applications on their own without the need to involve programmers. To realize this vision, a configurator component applying a model-driven approach is developed. As this component shall relieve domain experts from technical issues, it has to be proven that domain experts are actually able to use the configurator properly. The experiment presented in this paper investigates the mental efforts for creating such data collection applications by comparing novices and experts. Results reveal that even novices are able to model instruments with an acceptable number of errors. Altogether, the QuestionSys framework empowers domain experts to develop sophisticated mobile data collection applications by orders of magnitude faster compared to current mobile application development practices.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the role of digital zoom as a tool for directing attention while looking at visual learning material. In particular, we analyzed whether minimal digital zoom functions similarly to a rhetorical device by cueing mental zooming of attention accordingly. Participants were presented either static film clips, film clips with minimal zoom-ins, or film clips with minimal zoom-outs while eye movements were recorded. We hypothesized that minimal zoom-ins should lead to more gaze coherence, to longer dwell times as an indicator of more elaborative processing, and to fewer transitions as an indicator of less mental integration. Zoom-outs, on the other hand, were expected to have opposite effects. Results showed that zoom-ins increase gaze coherence and dwell times on the center parts of the depictions while decreasing transitions of pictorial elements from the center and the context areas. In contrast, patterns of results from zoom-outs and static presentations were similar to a large degree, indicating that zoom-ins and zoom-outs do not operate in a complementary fashion. Theoretical and practical implications of the present results are discussed.

AB  - Conversations in poster sessions in academic events, referred to as poster conversations, pose interesting and challenging topics on multi-modal multi-party interactions. This article gives an overview of our CREST project on the smart posterboard for multi-modal conversation analysis. The smart posterboard has multiple sensing devices to record poster conversations, so we can review who came to the poster and what kind of questions or comments he/she made. The conversation analysis combines speech and image processing such as face and eye-gaze tracking, speech enhancement and speaker diarization. It is shown that eye-gaze information is useful for predicting turn-taking and also improving speaker diarization. Moreover, high-level indexing of interest and comprehension level of the audience is explored based on the multi-modal behaviors during the conversation. This is realized by predicting the audience’s speech acts such as questions and reactive tokens.

Drawing on the experience of the authors, we provide recommendations on the setting of the experimental rooms, measurement equipment, software, and consumables. Moreover, we suggest sources of information where IS researchers could learn about neurophysiological measurement instruments and establish contacts with vendors of such instruments. Also, we provide practical advice on how to efficiently operate a NeuroIS lab. Illustrations from the Tech3Lab, HEC Montréal, are used to outline the specificity of a NeuroIS lab. We emphasize that the type of lab we discuss in this chapter is one with neurophysiological measurement instruments, and hence we do not focus on labs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or similar technologies.

AB  - A central issue in semantics and pragmatics is to understand how various different aspects of meaning contribute to the overall conveyed meaning of an utterance. Asserted content, implicatures, and presuppositions are commonly assumed to differ in terms of their source, their status, and their interaction with the context in the theoretical literature. This chapter starts with a brief introduction of this theoretical background, and then reviews the experimental literature on related phenomena in some detail, with a focus on presuppositions. In the course of this, the contributions to the present volume are situated in the context of previous work. The conclusion provides an outlook on future directions.

AB  - Gaze-control enables people to control a computer by using eye-gaze to select items on screen. Gaze-control is a necessity for people who have lost all motor control of their body and only have control over eye movements. In addition, gaze-control can be the quickest and least tiring option for a far broader group of people with varying disabilities. This paper reports findings from gaze-control user trials involving users from both groups: people who are totally paralyzed, as well as people with a wide range of complex disabilities. The trials conducted involved four different centres supporting people with disabilities in three different European countries. Several gaze-control systems were trialled by a large number of users with varying needs and abilities. The perceived benefits of gaze-control are described, and recommendations for successful assessment and implementation of gaze-control are provided.

AB  - The mind is selective in what it attends to in the environment. In this chapter, we describe potential implications of selective attention for emotional experience and well-being across the lifespan. We review theory and evidence examining the relationship between attention and well-being, first considering descriptive research that investigates reciprocal links between attention on the one hand, and affect and emotional well-being on the other. Using a lifespan developmental approach, we review research on attentional preferences and the use of attentional deployment in emotion regulation. Much of this work has used eye tracking to index attentional preferences and deployment. We then describe a number of training studies that suggest how attentional control can causally influence emotional well-being, and outline promising directions for future research, focusing on how age may moderate attention-emotion-well-being links.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 1398
EP  - 1412
VL  - 24
IS  - 5
AB  - Finding a probable explanation for observed symptoms is a highly complex task that draws on information retrieval from memory. Recent research suggests that observed symptoms are interpreted in a way that maximizes coherence for a single likely explanation. This becomes particularly clear if symptom sequences support more than one explanation. However, there are no existing process data available that allow coherence maximization to be traced in ambiguous diagnostic situations, where critical information has to be retrieved from memory. In this experiment, we applied memory indexing, an eye-tracking method that affords rich time-course information concerning memory-based cognitive processing during higher order thinking, to reveal symptom processing and the preferred interpretation of symptom sequences. Participants first learned information about causes and symptoms presented in spatial frames. Gaze allocation to emptied spatial frames during symptom processing and during the diagnostic response reflected the subjective status of hypotheses held in memory and the preferred interpretation of ambiguous symptoms. Memory indexing traced how the diagnostic decision developed and revealed instances of hypothesis change and biases in symptom processing. Memory indexing thus provided direct online evidence for coherence maximization in processing ambiguous information.

AB  - Grice distinguished between generalized and particularized conversational implicatures. The latter he described as ‘cases in which an implicature is carried by saying that p on a particular occasion in virtue of special features of the context’. The former he characterized as cases in which the ‘use of a certain form of words … would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature’ (Grice, 1989, p. 37). Grice did not develop the notion of a generalized conversational implicature (GCI) to any great extent. When he introduces the terminology in his paper ‘Logic and conversation’ he gives a few examples of the following sort:1(1)A man came to my office yesterday afternoon.(2)Max found a turtle in a garden.(3)Robert broke a finger last night.In the case of (1) the hearer would be surprised to discover that the man was the speaker’s husband, for the use of the indefinite noun phrase ‘a man’ implicates that the speaker is not intimately related to the man. Similarly, in (2) we assume that neither the turtle nor the garden was Max’s own, for if they were, the speaker would surely have used the expressions ‘his turtle’ and ‘his garden’. On the other hand, the use of an indefinite noun phrase does not always implicate the lack of an intimate relation between the subject and the thing indicated by the noun phrase. In the case of (3) there is an implicature that it was Robert‖s own finger that Robert broke.2

CY  - Cham
AB  - The paper describes the evolution in design and implementation of a new complex electro-informatics assistive medical system used for the communication with neuromotor disabled patients. These patients are severe handicapped persons who cannot interfere with real world by normal ways like speech, writing or language signs. Fortunately, these persons can see or can hear and they understand the meaning of different messages. The developed medical system is made by the following main functional components: the patient equipment, server, and caretaker device, connected together by using Internet available infrastructure. The bidirectional communication is performed by using keywords technology or ideograms presented on the patient’s screen provided by an application running at the server and accessed by the patient through a web browser. Patient needs are performed by using for interfacing with a software application by using different types of sensors including switch-type sensors (tactile, pressure, strain gauge) or eye tracking devices, all of these adapted to the patient’s physical condition. The medical system has also a secondary function, the remote monitoring of few vital physiological parameters needed for patient treatment and rehabilitation, based on wireless and wearable sensor network, that share the same hardware platform. The application running on caretaker device displays the patient’s needs together with the values of the selected physiological parameters in real time. The medical devices are responsible for physiological parameters acquiring, preprocessing and forwarding into the server. The server performs the parameters processing and computing the medical condition of the patient and also has the ability of sending alerts to the caretaker when one or more parameters are outside the normal limits. The application running on server manages the system databases, the communication protocols between patient and caretaker devices, records and processes the remote monitored data values and alarms the caretaker devices in emergency situations. The prototype of the developed medical system has been successfully within Clinic of “Geriatrics and Gerontology” at “Dr. C. I. Parhon” Hospital of Iaşi, Romania. The assistive solution proposed can be used in hospitals, care and treatment centers, nursing homes and also for patients treated in outpatient settings. The system contributes to increasing the level of care and treatment for neuromotor disabled patients, lowering costs in health care system.

AB  - This paper discusses the usefulness of tools that enable the analysis of eye movement data in dynamic interfaces for investigating theoretical issues in the area of multimedia learning. One of these tools, GazeTrackerTM, a program that links eye movement data to information about the internal computer processes and automatically combines the two for further analyses, is discussed. The functionality of the tool for studying the process of multimedia learning is illustrated with an experiment on the integration of text and pictures in a web-based lesson on instructional design. In the experiment, differences in fixation patterns between several presentation formats are investigated. It is concluded that tools like GazeTrackerTM make it easier to study how people integrate text and pictures in dynamic interfaces like web browsers.

SP  - 47

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Recent advances in neuro-physiological measurements resulted in reliable and objective measures of Cognitive Load (CL), for example, using pupillary responses. However, continuous measurement of CL in software design activities, for example, conceptual modeling, has received little attention. In this paper, we present the progress of our work intended to close this gap by continuously measuring cognitive load during design activities. This work aims at advancing our understanding of WHEN and WHY designers face challenges. For this, we attempt to explore and explain the occurrence of CL using fine-granular units of analysis (e.g., type of subtasks, evolution of design artifact’s quality, and manner of technology use). We expect implications for the future development of intelligent software systems, which are aware WHEN a particular designer experiences challenges, but also WHY challenges occur.

VL  - 42
IS  - 8
AB  - To investigate how people with Autism are affected by the presence of goals during imitation, we conducted a study to measure movement kinematics and eye movements during the imitation of goal-directed and goal-less hand movements. Our results showed that a control group imitated changes in movement kinematics and increased the level that they tracked the hand with their eyes, in the goal-less compared to goal-direction condition. In contrast, the ASD group exhibited more goal-directed eye movements, and failed to modulate the observed movement kinematics successfully in either condition. These results increase the evidence for impaired goal-less imitation in ASD, and suggest that there is a reliance on goal-directed strategies for imitation in ASD, even in the absence of visual goals.

BT  - Explicit and Implicit Prosody in Sentence Processing: Studies in Honor of Janet Dean Fodor
SP  - 287
EP  - 307
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In this chapter, we review recent research concerned with “inner voice” experiences during silent reading of direct speech (e.g., Mary said, “This dress is beautiful!”) and indirect speech (e.g., Mary said that the dress was beautiful). Converging findings from speech analysis, brain imaging, and eye tracking indicate that readers spontaneously engage in mental simulations of audible-speech like representations during silent reading of direct speech, and to a much lesser extent during silent reading of indirect speech. This “simulated” implicit prosody is highly correlated with the overt prosody generated during actual speaking. We then compare this “simulated” implicit prosody with the sort of “default” implicit prosody that is commonly discussed in relation to syntactic ambiguity resolution. We hope our discussion will motivate new interdisciplinary research into prosodic processing during reading which could potentially unify the two phenomena within a single theoretical framework.

AB  - The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is commonly used to understand the processes involved in decision-making. Though the task was originally run without a computer, using a computerized version of the task has become typical. These computerized versions of the IGT are useful, because they can make the task more standardized across studies and allow for the task to be used in environments where a physical version of the task may be difficult or impossible to use (e.g., while collecting brain imaging data). Though these computerized versions of the IGT have been useful for experimentation, having multiple software implementations of the task could present reliability issues. We present an open-source software version of the Iowa Gambling Task (called IGT-Open) that allows for millisecond visual presentation accuracy and is freely available to be used and modified. This software has been used to collect data from human subjects and also has been used to run model-based simulations with computational process models developed to run in the ACT-R architecture.

We argue that most evidence is consistent with the one-system view. Second, how should we relate grammatical theories and language processing models to each other?

AB  - Emotions play a critical role during learning and problem solving with advanced learning technologies. However, learners typically do not accurately monitor and regulate their emotions and may therefore not learn as much, disengage from the task, and not optimize their learning of the instructional material. Despite their importance, relatively few attempts have been made to understand learners’ emotional monitoring and regulation during learning with advanced learning technologies by using data visualizations of their own (and others’) cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) self-regulated learning (SRL) processes to potentially foster their emotion regulation during learning with advanced learning technologies. We present a theoretically-based and empirically-driven conceptual framework that addresses emotion regulation by proposing the use of visualizations of one’s and others’ CAMM-SRL multichannel data (e.g., cognitive strategy use, metacognitive monitoring accuracy, facial expressions of emotions, physiological arousal, eye-movement behaviors, etc.) to facilitate learners’ monitoring and regulation of their emotions during learning with advanced learning technologies. We use examples from several of our laboratory and classroom studies to illustrate a possible mapping between theoretical assumptions, emotion-regulation strategies, and the types of data visualizations that can be used to enhance and scaffold learners’ emotion regulation, including key processes such as emotion flexibility, emotion adaptivity, and emotion efficacy. We conclude with future directions that can lead to a systematic interdisciplinary research agenda that addresses outstanding emotion regulation-related issues by integrating models, theories, methods, and analytical techniques for the areas of cognitive, learning, and affective sciences, human computer interaction, data visualization, big data, data mining, data science, learning analytics, open learner models, and SRL.

The test format effect also addresses the issue of test validity—whether the reading test properly elicits construct-relevant reading skills or ability. The research questions guiding the study are as follows: (1) Do test scores differ systematically depending on the test format? (2) Do the predictors of test scores differ systematically depending on the test format?

AB  - Digital games have the potential to provide an ideal environment for students to “learn how to learn.” However, this potential remains as of yet untapped (Squire, 2006). It is no secret that today’s youth have become mesmerized by computer games and gaming consoles. The motivating factors inherent in games grab the attention of youth compelling them to play the same game for hours at a time. Moreover, youth do not seem deterred by the time required to conquer the steep learning curve necessary to succeed in complex, open-ended gaming environments. For these reasons, gamebased learning environments (GBLEs) have garnered increasing attention in the educational research community. However, serious games, or games that are used for purposes other than entertainment, are still not common in educational settings. By juxtaposing the captivating nature of games with educational content, it seems reasonable to assume students would find similar motivation to conquer GBLEs that could discreetly yield educational gains. Furthermore, these environments provide promising contexts in which to study self-regulated learning (SRL) due to the complex yet autonomous settings that they afford.

IS  - 4
AB  - In three experiments we tested the effects of spatial visualization ability on performance of a motion-verification task, in which subjects were shown a diagram of a mechanical system and were asked to verify a sentence stating the motion of one of the system components. We propose that this task involves component processes of (1) sentence comprehension, (2) diagram comprehension, (3) text-diagram integration, and (4) mental animation. Subjects with law spatial ability made more errors than did subjects with high spatial ability on this task, and they made more errors on items in which more system components had to be animated to solve the problem. In contrast, the high-spatial subjects were relatively accurate on all trials. These results indicate that spatial visualization is correlated with accuracy on the motion-verification task and suggest that this correlation is primarily due to the mental animation component of the task. Reaction time and eye-fixation data revealed no differences in how the high- and low-spatial subjects decomposed the task. The data of the two groups of subjects were equally consistent with a piecemeal model of mental animation, in which components are animated one by one in order of the causal chain of events in the system.

AB  - Both the use of Web sites and the empirical knowledge as to what constitutes effective Web site design has grown exponentially in recent years. The aim of the current article is to outline the history and key elements of Web site design in an e-commerce context – primarily in the period 2002–2012. It was in 2002 that a Special Issue of ISR was focused on ‘Measuring e-Commerce in Net-Enabled Organizations.’ Before this, work was conducted on Web site design, but much of it was anecdotal. Systematic, empirical research and modeling of Web site design to dependent variables like trust, satisfaction, and loyalty until then had not receive substantial focus – at least in the information systems domain. In addition to an overview of empirical findings, this article has a practical focus on what designers must know about Web site elements if they are to provide compelling user experiences, taking into account the site’s likely users. To this end, the article elaborates components of effective Web site design, user characteristics, and the online context that impact Web usage and acceptance, and design issues as they are relevant to diverse users including those in global markets. Web site elements that result in positive business impact are articulated. This retrospective on Web site design concludes with an overview of future research directions and current developments.

BT  - Human-Centered and Error-Resilient Systems Development
SP  - 56
EP  - 72
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - User Centered Design processes argue for user testing in order to assess and improve the quality of the interactive systems developed. The underlying belief is that the findings from user testing related to usability and user experience will inform the design of the interactive system in a relevant manner. Unfortunately reports from the industrial practice indicate that this is not straightforward and a lot of data gathered during user tests is hard to understand and exploit. This paper claims that injecting results from user-tests in user-tasks descriptions support the exploitation of user test results for designing the n+1 prototype. In order to do so, the paper proposes a set of extensions to current task description techniques and a process for systematically populating task models with data and analysis gathered during user testing. Beyond the already known advantages of task models, these enriched task models provide additional benefits in different phases of the development process. For instance, it is possible to go beyond standard task-model based performance evaluation exploiting real performance data from usability evaluation. Additionally, it also supports task-model based comparisons of two alternative systems. It can also support performance prediction and overall supports identification of usability problems and identifies shortcomings for user experience. The application of such a process is demonstrated on a case study from the interactive television domain.

In regard to reading of English text, just how much we can learn from a person’s gaze pattern? It is known that while reading, we inadvertently form rational connections between pieces of information we pick up from the text. That reflects in certain disruptions in the norms of reading paradigm and that gives us clues to our interest level in reading activities.

AB  - In the past, three interrelated, process-oriented theoretical approaches have been used to support linear funnel models. These are the comprehensive models of the “grand theory” as well as hierarchy-of-effect models from advertising research and multistage choice set models from behavioral decision theory. Notwithstanding certain similarities, there are differences in these theories.

BT  - Advances in Brain Inspired Cognitive Systems
SP  - 44

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Through introducing the psychology model of reading cognitive, this paper uses the LSTM neural network and the CRF model respectively to simulate the language cognition process and the eye-movement control process in reading, in order to overcome the defect that the traditional CRF prediction model only considers the context information of the label sequence but can not take into account the context information of the text sequence. First, the psychological process of reading cognition is introduced and the prediction model of saccade target based on LSTM-CRF for Chinese reading is proposed. Then, the experimental data, experimental environment, feature templates and parameter settings needed for model training are introduced. Finally, the conclusion is drawn through experimental comparison: (1) The F1 score of prediction model in saccade labeling based on LSTM-CRF is superior to the traditional CRF prediction model; (2) The predictability of the language itself is an important feature of the saccade target prediction model; (3) The best saccade length for Chinese readers is about 2.5 Chinese characters.

SP  - 243
EP  - 269

CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - This chapter addresses a topic that has been the subject of intense curiosity throughout civilized history. What are the roots of genius? Are geniuses divinely inspired? Are they mad? What is the nature of their gift? Is it something that can be cultivated? Or perhaps harnessed like a beast of draught? Do geniuses possess a genetic loading for their gift? If the germ of inspiration has a biological component, it would seem that the cornerstone of the creative process remains inaccessible to most of us. If this is the case, it poses an interesting dilemma: Why should a feature of human behavior so critical to the advancement of the species be restricted to so small a segment of the species? After more than 2,500 years of curiosity, we can conclude very little that is definitive. We cannot state with certainty that some genetic contribution enhances creative potential. We cannot state with certainty that creativity can be encouraged, though we undoubtedly can state how it may be discouraged. Despite reams of stories, some farfetched and some true, relating creativity to mental illness, the idea that one must be slightly mad to be creative is so counterintuitive that it is rejected by most sober-minded scientists. And rightfully so. It certainly would not be evolutionarily adaptive to wed the curse of mental illness to the gift of creativity. This dilemma was raised by Barron (1958):But one cannot readily abandon the idea that to create is in some sense—perhaps in the best sense—to be healthy in mind. Yet how can the maladjustment of many great creative minds be reconciled with the assertion that they are in some respects unusually healthy? (p. 163)Barron determined, however, that the seeming illogic of associating maladjustment with creativity can be understood from the standpoint of the source of creative inspiration—the unconscious. The creative person is said to be at higher risk for disorder by virtue of gamboling at the seat of disorder.

AB  - This research selects three typical kinds of labels as the research objects, including static label, focus label and the input label. 30 participants are selected randomly and they are required to finish the pre-established task. The RED desktop eye tracker in iView X series is used to record users’ eye movement data. After the test, the eye movement data including focus path, the number of fixation, average fixation times, saccades distance as well as regressive eye movement times are analyzed by using the BeGaze software. The result of this research showed: In terms of efficiency, inputting label is superior to the focusing label, and efficiency of participants under static label is relatively lower than other two types.

AB  - The basis for individual differences in the degree to which visual speech input enhances comprehension of acoustically degraded speech is largely unknown. Previous research indicates that fine facial detail is not critical for visual enhancement when auditory information is available; however, these studies did not examine individual differences in ability to make use of fine facial detail in relation to audiovisual speech perception ability. Here, we compare participants based on their ability to benefit from visual speech information in the presence of an auditory signal degraded with noise, modulating the resolution of the visual signal through low-pass spatial frequency filtering and monitoring gaze behavior. Participants who benefited most from the addition of visual information (high visual gain) were more adversely affected by the removal of high spatial frequency information, compared to participants with low visual gain, for materials with both poor and rich contextual cues (i.e., words and sentences, respectively). Differences as a function of gaze behavior between participants with the highest and lowest visual gains were observed only for words, with participants with the highest visual gain fixating longer on the mouth region. Our results indicate that the individual variance in audiovisual speech in noise performance can be accounted for, in part, by better use of fine facial detail information extracted from the visual signal and increased fixation on mouth regions for short stimuli. Thus, for some, audiovisual speech perception may suffer when the visual input (in addition to the auditory signal) is less than perfect.

VL  - 236

AB  - Older adults with falls risk tend to look away prematurely from targets for safe foot placement to view future hazards; behaviour associated with increased anxiety and stepping inaccuracies. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of route previewing in reducing anxiety and optimizing gaze behaviour and stepping performance of younger and older adults. Nine younger and nine older adults completed six walks with three task complexities over two sessions. Each trial used either an isolated stepping target, or a target followed by either one or two obstacles. Participants with eyes closed, on hearing a signal, opened their eyes and initiated walking (go trials) or stood previewing the route for 10 s before starting (preview trials). Kinematic data were collected using a Vicon motion analysis system. Gaze behaviour was recorded using a Dikablis eye tracker. On average, both older and younger adults fixated the target for significantly longer during walking when they had previewed the route than when they had not. Self-confidence scores were also significantly higher following ‘preview trials’ than ‘go trials’. Stepping performance significantly improved following route previewing (reduced Medial lateral foot placement variability for both groups and reduced anterior/posterior foot placement error in older adults only). These findings implicate route previewing as a potential intervention to increase self-confidence and reduce the risk of tripping in older adults.

AB  - Industry 4.0 factories become more and more complex with increased maintenance costs. Reducing costs by cyber-physical (CP) controllers should ensure the commercialization of the CPS for smart factory project results. We implement multi-adaptive CP controllers in the following domains: industrial robot arms, car manufacturing, steel industry, and assembly lines in general. The main objective is to implement such controllers for these application domains and let the industry partners provide feedback about the cost reduction potential. In this paper, we describe the technical infrastructure including deep learning and knowledge acquisition submodules, followed by anomaly detection modules and intelligent user interfaces in the IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm. In addition, we report on three concrete use case implementations of industrial robots and anomaly modeling, knowledge management and anomaly treatment in the steel domain, and anomaly detection in the energy domain.

AB  - A theory of human sentence processing is a characterisation of how people recover an interpretation for a given utterance. Ultimately such a theory should detail the processor’s organisation, the representations employed, and the algorithms used to construct an analysis — where such a characterisation is isomorphic to that of the mind. Furthermore, we must situate the sentence processor with respect to the other cognitive systems with which it interacts, outlining the nature and degree of communication at all interfaces.

SP  - 93
EP  - 119
VL  - 25
IS  - 2
AB  - The present study employed priming techniques to investigate whether unfamiliar metaphors are understood automatically, or whether controlled processes are required for comprehension. Priming sentences were presented to 76 participants in a naming task and vocal RT (reaction time) to target words was recorded. Target words were associates of the 120 metaphors used in the stimulus set. SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony) was manipulated in order to permit the measurement of both automatic and attentional priming (375ms, 750ms, and 1,500ms). Four priming conditions enabled a comparison between metaphoric, literal, and neutral contexts, and an unrelated (baseline) condition. The data revealed a strong priming effect for metaphors at an SOA of 1,500ms, but no effects at either of the shorter SOAs. These results indicate that, in the absence of supporting context, unfamiliar metaphors are not processed automatically. Comprehension of such linguistic phenomena apparently requires attentional processing. The findings have implications for direct processing theories of metaphor comprehension.

AB  - We are living in an information society. For us it is normal to access relevant information almost immediately. In our world, information systems play an important role in our private as well as in our professional lives. When selecting or developing such systems, especially complex ones, we need to understand and model the requirements on these systems. This paper deals with the modeling of complex information systems. We show which requirements concepts could be modeled, but also argue that it is not necessary to model all concepts. We show empirical studies that make us believe that further empirical research is needed in order to know which requirements concepts are most relevant. Current challenges as well as future challenges with regard to information system modeling are outlined.

JO  - Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications
SP  - 29
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Visualizations—visual representations of information, depicted in graphics—are studied by researchers in numerous ways, ranging from the study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be due to a lack of a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process account of decision making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility of a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.

VL  - 45
IS  - 5
AB  - A number of previous studies on Chinese relative clauses (RC) have reported conflicting results on processing asymmetry. This study aims to revisit the prevalent debate on whether subject-extracted RCs (SRC) or object-extracted RCs (ORC) are easier to process by using the eye-movement technique. In the current study, the data are analyzed in terms of the gaze duration and regression of eye-movement in three critical areas: head noun, embedded verb, and RC-modifying noun phrase as subject. The results show an ORC preference for the processing of RC structures, which supports the word-order account and the Dependency Locality Theory, and a better cross-clausal integration for SRC, which supports the perspective-shift account. The processing asymmetry in Chinese RCs are discussed under relevant theoretical accounts, such as structure-based, memory-based, and perspective shift accounts. We argue that the findings are associated with the syntactic nature of Chinese (a head-initial language with pre-nominal RCs).

AB  - The collaboration during the modeling process is uncomfortable and characterized by various limitations. Faced with the successful transfer of first process modeling languages to the augmented world, non-transparent processes can be visualized in a more comprehensive way. With the aim to rise comfortability, speed, accuracy and manifoldness of real world process augmentations, a framework for the bidirectional interplay of the common process modeling world and the augmented world has been designed as morphologic box. Its demonstration proves the working of drawn AR integrations. Identified dimensions were derived from (1) a designed knowledge construction axiom, (2) a designed meta-model, (3) designed use cases and (4) designed directional interplay modes. Through a workshop-based survey, the so far best AR modeling configuration is identified, which can serve for benchmarks and implementations.

CY  - New York, NY
AB  - This international handbook is the first compendium focused specifically on cutting-edge interdisciplinary research on metacognition and learning technologies. It presents current interdisciplinary research from the cognitive, educational, and computational sciences on learning with educational technologies. The topic is of key importance to researchers and educators because there is a wealth of empirical data indicating that learners of all ages have difficulty learning about complex topics in areas such as science and math. A major challenge for learners lies in monitoring and controlling key cognitive and metacognitive processes during learning. To synthesize current research, all handbook authors were asked to address the following in their individual chapters: (1) describe the context in which a particular learning technology is used to support or foster learners’ metacognition and self-regulated learning, (2) explain the conceptual and theoretical framework of cognition and metacognition, (3) provide evidence regarding the system’s effectiveness in detecting, modeling, tracking, and fostering learners’ metacognitive and self-regulatory behaviors, (4) discuss design implications for metacognitive tools to support metacognition and SRL, and (5) critically examine theoretical, methodological, analytical, and instructional challenges when using learning technologies for metacognition and SRL. The handbook is divided into five sections: (1) models and components of metacognition, (2) assessment and modeling metacognitive knowledge and skills, (3) scaffolding metacognition and learning with hypermedia and hypertext, (4) ITSs and dialogue systems, and (5) multiagent systems to measure and foster metacognition and SRL.

AB  - Covert sensitization is an imagery-based aversive treatment for decreasing craving and inducing aversion toward abused substances. In the present study, we used virtual reality to enhance the effects of covert sensitization. The aim was to verify the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization treatment in reducing heavy social drinkers’ alcohol craving. The explicit and implicit measurements included a self-report questionnaire, alcohol-Implicit Association Test, eye-tracking test, and alcohol-Stroop test. To determine the baseline, we measured the alcohol craving in heavy social drinkers (N = 20) and light drinkers (N = 20). Furthermore, virtual covert sensitization treatment was administered to each participant for 10 min. Afterward, the same measurements as at baseline were repeated. Despite the one-time nature of the administered treatment, our results confirm the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization based on the participants’ changed implicit craving and explicit, self-reported craving. Therefore, virtual covert sensitization may be an effective intervention technique for alcohol addiction treatment.

AB  - We developed an end-to-end process for inducing models of behavior from expert task performance through in-depth case study. A subject matter expert (SME) performed navigational and adversarial tasks in a virtual tank combat simulation, using the dTank and Unreal platforms. Using eye tracking and Cognitive Task Analysis, we identified the key goals pursued by and attributes used by the SME, including reliance on an egocentric spatial representation, and on the fly re-representation of terrain in qualitative terms such as “safe” and “risky”. We demonstrated methods for automatic extraction of these qualitative higher-order features from combinations of surface features present in the simulation, producing a terrain map that was visually similar to the SME annotated map. The application of decision-tree and instance-based machine learning methods to the transformed task data supported prediction of SME task selection with greater than 95 % accuracy, and SME action selection at a frequency of 10 Hz with greater than 63 % accuracy, with real time constraints placing limits on algorithm selection. A complete processing model is presented for a path driving task, with the induced generative model deviating from the SME chosen path by less than 2 meters on average. The derived attributes also enabled environment portability, with path driving models induced from dTank performance and deployed in Unreal demonstrating equivalent accuracy to those induced and deployed completely within Unreal.

The UES has been adopted and adapted to measure engagement in various domains, including online search, news, and video; educational, haptic, consumer, and social networking applications; and video games. Over 50 studies are synthesized to examine the dimensionality, reliability, validity and generalizability of the UES. In addition to illuminating the strengths and weaknesses of the UES as a measurement tool, this chapter uses the UES to explore the reciprocal relationship between theory and the development and application of measurement instruments in user experience research

Most of these features are associated with subjective perceptions that are tacit and difficult to externalize and translate into a form intelligible to a computer system. Addressing this issue entails important mechanisms underlying social and affective interactive processes and computational tools that support such processes. In relation to presence, for example, the potential of computational and visual artifacts lie in using emotional responses and expressions to support both agent–human interaction as well as computer-mediated human–human interaction.

TI  - Boon or Burden? The Role of Compositional Meaning in Figurative Language Processing and Acquisition
JO  - Journal of Logic, Language and Information
SP  - 359
EP  - 387
VL  - 28
IS  - 2
AB  - We critically address current theories of figurative language, focusing on the role of literal or compositional meaning in the interpretation of non-literal expressions, including idioms and metaphors. Specifically, we formulate and discuss the processing hypothesis that compositional meaning may either facilitate or impede the recovery or construction of the intended figurative meaning depending on multiple factors, and in particular, on the expression’s decomposability and on the “strength” of semantic relations between the compositional and figurative meanings. As a case study, we consider research on processing and acquisition of figurative expressions in highly verbal individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in comparison to neuro-typical individuals, and examine the factors that may account for the observed comprehension deficits in the ASD group. Based on this evidence, we discuss some of the strategies employed by language users in processing non-compositional or non-literal expressions, and we highlight implications for research on natural language comprehension and processing systems in the domain of figurative meaning.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 1285
EP  - 1310
VL  - 48
IS  - 6
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that fixed expressions such as idioms have a processing advantage over non-idiomatic language. While many idioms are metaphoric, metonymic, or even literal, the effect of varying nonliteralness in their processing has not been much researched yet. Theoretical and empirical findings suggest that metonymies are easier to process than metaphors but it is unclear whether this applies to idioms. Two self-paced reading experiments test whether metonymic, metaphoric, or literal idioms have a greater processing advantage over non-idiomatic control sentences, and whether this is caused by varying nonliteralness. Both studies find that metonymic and literal idioms are read significantly faster than controls, while the advantage for metaphoric idioms is only tenuous. Only experiment 2 finds literal idioms to be read fastest of all. As compositionality of the idioms cannot account for these findings, some effect of nonliteralness is suggested, together with idiomaticity and the sentential context.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex disease with multifactorial etiology. The schizophrenia phenotype has been traditionally defined by chronic psychosis and functional deterioration. However, the boundary of the phenotype is likely to be more extensive than the one defined by chronic psychosis. This is highlighted by the findings of subtle, schizophrenialike deficits in the nonschizophrenic, first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients. Subtle clinical signs and symptoms, cognitive impairment particularly in attention and memory, and neurophysiologic deficits such as in sensory gating and smooth-pursuit eye movements all define aspects of the schizophrenia phenotype.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 1035
EP  - 1055
VL  - 47
IS  - 5
AB  - The processing advantage of Subject-gapped relative clause (SRC) versus Object-gapped relative clause (ORC) has been advocated by competing processing accounts. Using a self-paced listening paradigm, this study investigates what Chinese RC online processing asymmetry looks like under concurrent memory load manipulation. Both On-line listening times and Post-online measures of Chinese SRCs and ORCs are estimated and compared. The on-line results show that ORCs and SRCs demonstrate no differential processing patterns under the interfering conditions. At the relativizer-DE marker region, under 0-digt-load, SRCs show processing advantage, while under 5-digit-load condition, SRCs display greater listening times than ORCs. Furthermore, the Post-online RTs and accuracy of post-sentence comprehension and digit recalls show that processing of SRCs had worse performance. These results lead to the conjecture that there may be no intrinsic processing asymmetry in Chinese RCs, and underscore the necessity that future studies in exploring the processing metrics of sentence complexity should consider the working memory involvement.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 125
EP  - 139
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
AB  - Within Generative Grammar, binding constraints on co-reference are usually defined in syntactic terms. However, some researchers have pointed out examples in which syntactically defined binding constraints do not seem to apply, proposing instead that a complete account of linguistic co-reference needs to consider notions of discourse structure. There have been several proposals in the literature for the division of labor between syntax and discourse in the definition of binding constraints. In this paper, we review these proposals in the context of recent work that applies on-line techniques to explore the roles of syntactic and discourse preferences in terms of the time course with which they become active during sentence comprehension. Some of this research suggests that (syntactic) binding principles may be momentarily applied during processing, even in cases in which the final interpretation suggests otherwise. We end the paper by considering the theoretical and methodological implications of this view.

TI  - Using empirical studies to mitigate symbol overload in iStar extensions
JO  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - Modelling languages are frequently extended to include new constructs to be used together with the original syntax. New constructs may be proposed by adding textual information, such as UML stereotypes, or by creating new graphical representations. Thus, these new symbols need to be expressive and proposed in a careful way to increase the extension’s adoption. A method to create symbols for the original constructs of a modelling language was proposed and has been used to create the symbols when a new modelling language is designed. We argue this method can be used to recommend new symbols for the extension’s constructs. However, it is necessary to make some adjustments since the new symbols will be used with the existing constructs of the modelling language original syntax. In this paper, we analyse the usage of this adapted method to propose symbols to mitigate the occurrence of overloaded symbols in the existing iStar extensions. We analysed the existing iStar extensions in an SLR and identified the occurrence of symbol overload among the existing constructs. We identified a set of fifteen overloaded symbols in existing iStar extensions. We used these concepts with symbol overload in a multi-stage experiment that involved users in the visual notation design process. The study involved 262 participants, and its results revealed that most of the new graphical representations were better than those proposed by the extensions, with regard to semantic transparency. Thus, the new representations can be used to mitigate this kind of conflict in iStar extensions. Our results suggest that next extension efforts should consider user-generated notation design techniques in order to increase the semantic transparency.

AB  - This chapter begins with the application of communication theories, including Relevance Theory, to the process of translation before moving on to a consideration of translation process research, which has developed tools such as think-aloud protocols, keyboard logging and eye tracking to develop theories about the cognitive dimension of the translation process. Next we examine theories relating to interpreting where process research has a longer history than in any other area of translation. From there we move to new areas of translation where we investigate theories about the processes of software and games localization. Finally, we review the theories which have emanated from the rapidly expanding domain of audiovisual translation.

AB  - The primary focus of NeuroIS research from a methodological perspective is set on methods and research design, data collection, and data analysis. In this paper, we address a practical problem, related to the data collection phase, namely the choice of a data collection instrument, or a NeuroIS tool. Before making a tool decision, researchers have to carefully study the features of each device, based on specified requirements, in order to select the most suitable tool. Thus, the tool choice becomes a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we propose an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based approach for the selection of a NeuroIS tool. We introduce a framework based on a step-by-step procedure of decision hierarchy creation, followed by the construction of a list of potential measurement tools, and the execution of the AHP decision making process.

SP  - 48

VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Dual system and dual process views of the human mind have contrasted automatic, fast, and non-conscious with controlled, slow, and conscious thinking. This paper integrates duality models from the perspective of consumer psychology by identifying three relevant theoretical strands: Persuasion and attitude change (e.g. Elaboration Likelihood Model), judgment and decision making (e.g. Intuitive vs. Reflective Model), as well as buying and consumption behavior (e.g. Reflective-Impulsive Model). Covering different aspects of consumer decision making, we discuss the conditions under which different types of processes are evoked, how they interact and how they apply to consumers’ processing of marketing messages, the evaluation of product-related information, and purchasing behavior. We further compare and contrast theoretical strands and incorporate them with the literature on attitudes, showing how duality models can help us understand implicit and explicit attitude formation in consumer psychology. Finally, we offer future research implications for scholars in consumer psychology and marketing.

SP  - 1302

VL  - 31
IS  - 8
AB  - In two experiments, we examined the influence of situation-evoking stimuli on the resolution of lexical ambiguity. In Experiment 1, we examined situation-evoking stimuli at an early NP position. Readers were asked to establish whether specific entities were likely to participate as agents in contextually defined situations. Naming latencies demonstrated that defined situations headed by likely agents evoked a domain of reference that included only the situation-appropriate meaning of a targeted lexical ambiguity. In contrast, defined situations headed by unlikely agents evoked a domain of reference that did not include either meaning of the intended ambiguous word. In Experiment 2, we examined situation-evoking stimuli at a later direct object position. The specificity of the theme/patient role filler was manipulated, where the linguistic expressions were either specific or general with respect to a given contextual situation. The results showed that contexts with specific situation-evoking stimuli were rated as strongly biased and provided a domain of reference for the immediate resolution of lexical ambiguity, whereas contexts with nonspecific role fillers were rated as ambiguous and provided a domain of reference that was supportive of both meanings of an ambiguous word. The results were discussed within a contextual-feature-sensitive model of language processing.

However, information retrieval systems are still using mainly objective, algorithmic measures of relevance. The aim of the present paper is to raise a discussion around the possibility that bring state-of-the-art physiological computing methods to model subjective components of relevance. We center the discussion on the relevance types known in the information science literature as psychological, affective and motivational relevance. The paper presents a definition of these concepts, as well as an overview of the recent advances in physiological computing methods developed in information science and information retrieval. We conclude with a discussion around the potential of physiological computing methods to model psychological, affective or motivational relevance.

AB  - User experience (UX) refers to a person’s emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes a person’s perceptions of various related aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. In our work, we decided to test and evaluated a potential of UX use under the conditions of a small company in Slovakia. We started with an analysis of relevant business processes in the company with the aim to identify possible points for change or improvement. Based on the results, we designed a new web application to support related company’s processes. During the design phase, we used suitable UX elements to ensure the most positive end-user perception with the final prototype, such as paper sketches, wireframes or functional prototypes. The final version brought a high level of customer satisfaction. He did not evaluate positively only the implemented functionalities and usability of the web application, but also the UX elements he came into contact with. The most important lessons learned are intensive communication with end-user during the whole development process; a decision about a common vocabulary to make this communication easier; an organisation of the f2f testing sessions, not only in virtual form.

AB  - Cognitive Accessibility is an important aspect of Web accessibility addressing a considerably large number of users and showing a high impact on general usability. Cognitive accessibility has been on the agenda in Web accessibility since its beginning but the body of R&D is much smaller and also guidelines, standards, techniques, and tools are vaguer as well as addressed at a lower priority. The recent focus on cognitive accessibility in W3C/WAI changes the situation. This chapter discusses the state of the art and the different domains, where R&D is needed for guidelines and standards, inclusion and participation of end users, take-up of the digital potential in service provision and new tool development based on user tracking/understanding and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We conclude by proposing a new concept of user involvement and a framework for R&D supporting the integration of profiling, annotating, adapting and translating content for personalized Cognitive Accessibility and using/adapting proven and stable HCI concepts.

AB  - Reading is one of the most enduring cognitive inventions of humans. Attentional demands are high in this highly cognitively complex task. In this chapter, the aim is to examine how attentional influences work in the reading process. Psycholinguistic theories of visual word recognition and attentional processes during visual word recognition are discussed. In addition, the time course of lexical access during visual word recognition is also examined. There has been much work on eye movements during reading sentences which have shown the subtle manner in which attentional shifts are linked to the comprehension process. The chapter will examine attention in reading, both at the single word level and at the whole sentence level. Dyslexia will also be discussed as recent evidence suggests a role of vision and attention in this specific reading disorder. The chapter will demonstrate that attention during reading is intimately linked with language comprehension.

AB  - The debilitating effects and poor recovery rates associated with schizophrenia encourage the development of valid and reliable methods for early identification of and intervention with individuals at risk for it. As Edell discussed in Chapter 1, reliable assessment of vulnerability to schizophrenia is not possible at present, and additional work is needed to develop adequate etiological models of psychosis (see also Knight, 1984, 1992, 1993; Lenzenweger, 1993). Thus, multiple assessment strategies are warranted to maximize the opportunity for developing sensitive and specific measures of psychosis vulnerability. In addition to this screening and diagnostic goal, multiple measurement may prove valuable for understanding the specific mechanisms involved in psychosis vulnerability and their possible role in schizophrenia. This chapter reviews evidence for behavioral performance and psychophysiological anomalies in subjects potentially at risk for psychosis on the basis of psychometric criteria, in the service of understanding and preventing severe psychosis.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Given that Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) as an intelligence test with robust psychometric properties is considered to be a good measure of reasoning ability component of general intelligence, particularly its fluid factor, one would expect that uncovering the determinants of APM performance, especially reasoning patterns, could significantly contribute to understanding of intelligence. Our aim in this study was to identify types of reasoning processes involved in solving Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices test. To this end we carried out two studies: one involving eliciting verbal protocols in the form of Socratic tutorial dialogues and one involving controlling eye-fixation patterns. Results suggest that hypotheses generation and testing, involved in solving APM tasks, essentially amounts to abductive reasoning.

TI  - Development of a Cued Pro- and Antisaccade Paradigm: An Indirect Measure to Explore Automatic Components of Sexual Interest
JO  - Archives of Sexual Behavior
SP  - 2377
EP  - 2388
VL  - 46
IS  - 8
AB  - We developed a cued pro- and antisaccade paradigm (CPAP) to explore automatic components of sexual interest. Heterosexual participants (n = 32 women, n = 25 men) had to perform fast eye movements toward and away from sexually relevant or irrelevant stimuli across a congruent (i.e., prosaccade toward sexually relevant stimuli, antisaccade away from sexually irrelevant stimuli) and an incongruent condition (i.e., prosaccade toward sexually irrelevant stimuli, antisaccade away from sexually relevant stimuli). We hypothesized that pro- and antisaccade performance would be influenced by the sexual interest-specific relevance of the presented stimulus (i.e., nude female or male stimulus) and the instructed task (i.e., pro- or antisaccade) and, thus, differ meaningfully between conditions. Results for prosaccades toward sexually relevant stimuli in the congruent condition showed that error rates were lower and latencies were shorter compared with prosaccades toward sexually irrelevant stimuli in the incongruent condition, but only for male participants. In addition, error rates for antisaccades away from sexually irrelevant stimuli in the congruent condition were lower than for antisaccades away from sexually relevant stimuli in the incongruent condition, for both female and male participants. Latencies of antisaccades, however, did not differ between conditions. In comparison with established indirect sexual interest paradigms, the CPAP benefits from measuring highly automated processes less prone to deliberate control. To this end, the CPAP could be applied to explore the interplay of early automatic and deliberate components of sexual information processing.

AB  - This chapter reviews the contribution of new information-communication technologies to the advancement of educational assessment. Improvements can be described in terms of precision in detecting the actual values of the observed variables, efficiency in collecting and processing information, and speed and frequency of feedback given to the participants and stakeholders. The chapter reviews previous research and development in two ways, describing the main tendencies in four continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and the US) as well as summarizing research on how technology advances assessment in certain crucial dimensions (assessment of established constructs, extension of assessment domains, assessment of new constructs and in dynamic situations). As there is a great variety of applications of assessment in education, each one requiring different technological solutions, the chapter classifies assessment domains, purposes and contexts and identifies the technological needs and solutions for each. The chapter reviews the contribution of technology to the advancement of the entire educational evaluation process, from authoring and automatic generation and storage of items, through delivery methods (Internet-based, local server, removable media, mini-computer labs) to forms of task presentation made possible with technology for response capture, scoring and automated feedback and reporting. Finally, the chapter identifies areas for which further research and development is needed (migration strategies, security, availability, accessibility, comparability, framework and instrument compliance) and lists themes for research projects feasible for inclusion in the Assessment and Teaching of Twenty-first Century Skills project.

PB  - Springer Singapore
CY  - Singapore
AB  - In this chapter, we present a conceptual reference framework for designing augmented reality applications for supporting training. The framework leverages the capabilities of modern augmented reality and wearable technology for capturing the expert’s performance in order to support expertise development. It has been designed in the context of Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training (WEKIT) project which intends to deliver a novel technological platform for industrial training. The framework identifies the state-of-the-art augmented reality training methods, which we term as “transfer mechanisms” from an extensive literature review. Transfer mechanisms exploit the educational affordances of augmented reality and wearable technology to capture the expert performance and train the trainees. The framework itself is based upon Merrienboer’s 4C/ID model which is suitable for training complex skills. The 4C/ID model encapsulates major elements of apprenticeship models which is a primary method of training in industries. The framework complements the 4C/ID model with expert performance data captured with help of wearable technology which is then exploited in the model to provide a novel training approach for efficiently and effectively mastering the skills required. In this chapter, we will give a brief overview of our current progress in developing this framework.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Document foraging for information is a crucial and increasingly prevalent activity nowadays. We designed a computational cognitive model to simulate the oculomotor scanpath of an average web user searching for specific information from textual materials. In particular, the developed model dynamically combines visual, semantic, and memory processes to predict the user’s focus of attention during information seeking from paragraphs of text. A series of psychological experiments was conducted using eye-tracking techniques in order to validate and refine the proposed model. Comparisons between model simulations and human data are reported and discussed taking into account the strengths and shortcomings of the model. The proposed model provides a unique contribution to the investigation of the cognitive processes involved during information search and bears significant implications for web page design and evaluation.

JO  - International Journal of Automotive Technology
SP  - 915
EP  - 922
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
AB  - This paper proposes a systematic framework for operability evaluation of remotely controlled ground combat systems (RGCS) in a simulated environment. The popular human-robot interaction metric used in unmanned vehicle systems is called fan-out (FO) and represents the maximum number of robots/vehicles that could be controlled by a single human operator. However, FO is inappropriate for systems with a lower level of automation where vehicles are remotely controlled by a human, such as RGCS. The theoretical background of the suggested framework is based on McRuer’s crossover model that was initially developed in the aviation domain for explaining pilot handling issues. In this study, an evaluation/analysis software prototype was developed, known as the RGCS operability evaluation tool in a simulated environment (ROPES). The ROPES was designed to be a simple tool for use by officers or researchers who only have intuitive understanding on the human adaptability. The ROPES includes two sub-modules; 1) an interactive interface for the configuration of the RGCS dynamic parameters and user interfaces and 2) a time-varying graphical display of system and human performance. Examples case studies demonstrate the advantage of the ROPES, and improvement points were identified for future development.

SP  - 747
EP  - 761
VL  - 28
IS  - 6
AB  - This empirical study examined whether the visual complexities of the first and second characters in two-character words play similar roles in modulating the fixation time and saccade target selection during un-spaced Chinese reading. Consistent with prior research, words with low-complexity characters were fixated for shorter times than words with high-complexity characters. Critically, saccade target selection was primarily influenced by the visual complexity of the first character of a two-character word: words with low-complexity first characters were skipped more frequently, and fixation was localized nearer to the center of the word compared with the words with high-complexity first characters. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms of eye movement control in Chinese reading and thus provide benchmark data to test models of eye movement control in Chinese reading.

AB  - Goal: The goal of this symposium is to identify ‘state-of-the-art’ strategies for the use of antipsychotic medications in the management of children and adolescents with major psychiatric disorders. Learning objectives: 1. Define pediatric populations for whom second-generation antipsychotics are indicated 2. Identify the role of second-generation antipsychotics in the management of major psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents 3. Describe the level of evidence for the effectiveness of second-generation anti-psychotic use in youth 4. Discuss risk-benefit ratios of individual second-generation antipsychotics in pediatric populations 5. Use treatment algorithms and practice guidelines for the safe and effective use of second-generation antipsychotics in children and adolescents Background: Second-generation antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed to children and adolescents targeting a variety of psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. This is mainly due to lower rates of neuromotor side effects compared to conventional antipsychotics. In addition, second generation antipsychotics may also have superior and broader effectiveness than traditional antipsychotics. Content: This symposium will focus on the evaluation of the evidence base for the safety and effectiveness of second generation antipsychotics in the treatment of children and adolescents with major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, treatment guidelines and algorithms will be presented to help guide clinician’s treatment decisions.

AB  - Despite its popularity in the classroom, hypermedia learning is challenging, as empirical research has shown. The inherent design of the hypermedia structure requires students to engage in a variety of metacognitive monitoring processes, which provides feedback that facilitates the process of adaptation during learning. The Self-Regulated Learning Theory (SRL) has provided a theoretical lens to examine these processes during hypermedia learning. While a myriad of theoretical approaches to SRL exist, the Information Processing model has been widely used in the context of hypermedia learning. This article outlines the contributions of this theory to field of hypermedia learning, while also highlighting the need for additional empirical research that systematically considers theoretically-grounded constructs of motivation within SRL. The premise of this chapter is that motivation offers a potential explanation of individual differences in how students respond to negative feedback loops during hypermedia learning. Methodological and theoretical challenges are examined, including the identification of specific motivation constructs (e.g., outcome expectations, incentives, efficacy expectations, attributions, and utility) that align with existing SRL theoretical frameworks.

JO  - Instructional Science
SP  - 849

VL  - 41
IS  - 5
AB  - When reading conflicting science-related texts, readers may attend to cues which allow them to assess plausibility. One such plausibility cue is the use of graphs in the texts, which are regarded as typical of ‘hard science’. The goal of our study was to investigate the effects of the presence of graphs on the perceived plausibility and situation model strength for conflicting science-related texts, while including the influence of readers’ amount of experience with scientific texts and graphs as a potential moderator of these effects. In an experiment mimicking web-based informal learning, 77 university students read texts on controversial scientific issues which were presented with either graphs or tables. Perceived plausibility and situation model strength for each text were assessed immediately after reading; reader variables were assessed several weeks prior to the experiment proper. The results suggest that graphs can indeed serve as plausibility cues and thus boost situation model strength for texts which contain them. This effect was mediated by the perceived plausibility of the information in the texts with graphs. However, whether readers use graphs as plausibility cues in texts with conflicting information seems to depend also on their amount of experience with scientific texts and graphs.

TI  - Visual word recognition: Evidence for a serial bottleneck in lexical access
JO  - Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
AB  - Reading is a demanding task, constrained by inherent processing capacity limits. Do those capacity limits allow for multiple words to be recognized in parallel? In a recent study, we measured semantic categorization accuracy for nouns presented in pairs. The words were replaced by post-masks after an interval that was set to each subject’s threshold, such that with focused attention they could categorize one word with ~80% accuracy. When subjects tried to divide attention between both words, their accuracy was so impaired that it supported a serial processing model: on each trial, subjects could categorize one word but had to guess about the other. In the experiments reported here, we investigated how our previous result generalizes across two tasks that require lexical access but vary in the depth of semantic processing (semantic categorization and lexical decision), and across different masking stimuli, word lengths, lexical frequencies and visual field positions. In all cases, the serial processing model was supported by two effects: (1) a sufficiently large accuracy deficit with divided compared to focused attention; and (2) a trial-by-trial stimulus processing tradeoff, meaning that the response to one word was more likely to be correct if the response to the other was incorrect. However, when the task was to detect colored letters, neither of those effects occurred, even though the post-masks limited accuracy in the same way. Altogether, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that visual processing of words is parallel but lexical access is serial.

AB  - In CoSy, our robots were to be able to interact with human. These interactions served to help the robot learn more about its environment, or to plan and carry out actions. For a robot to make sense of such dialogues, it needs to understand how a dialogue can relate to, and refer to, “the world” – local visuo-spatial scenes, as in the Playmate scenario (9), or the spatial organization of an indoor environment in the Explorer scenario (10).

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The present study focused on the implicit and explicit search processes for easing an impasse during collaborative problem solving. In this study, an attractive actor or an anomaly cue, a ‘maverick,’ appeared to aid the participant in a rule discovery task. Problem solvers works on the task in which autonomous agents play the roles of collaborative partners. We collected verbal responses and eye movement data throughout the task to capture the implicit and explicit cognitive processes used by participants in interacting with the maverick during the search activities. The results indicate that for successful problem solvers, (1) an anomaly cue(maverick) in the group explicitly facilitated an adequate search process, and (2) an implicit search process may exist from an early stage and may develop during the learning process through incubation. Additionally, we observed through case studies that participants actively use the anomaly cue(maverick) as a reference to ease impasses.

AB  - This study is designed to explore the role of second language (L2) English learners’ working memory (WM), language proficiency, and age in the processing and comprehension of English anaphoric sentences. To this end, 40 EFL learners participated in the study. The proficiency levels of the participants varied from elementary to high-intermediate, as measured by the Quick Placement Test. A first-language Operation Span Task and a self-paced reading task were employed to measure the participants’ WM capacity and anaphoric sentence processing and comprehension respectively. The results of standard multiple regression analyses revealed that 36% of the variation in anaphoric processing, and 70% of variation in anaphoric sentences comprehension could be accounted for by the independent variables of the study, with the composite WM as the only significant predictor. Moreover, both components of WM, i.e. WM processing and WM storage, significantly predicted 36% and 72% of variation in anaphoric processing and comprehension respectively; with the WM processing having a greater contribution in both cases. The findings of the study provide empirical evidence on the significant role of WM on anaphoric resolution.

SP  - 49

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Evaluating highly dynamic and heterogeneous Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) is extremely challenging. Components of PLEs are selected and configured by individual users based on their personal preferences, needs, and goals. Moreover, the systems usually evolve over time based on contextual opportunities and constraints. As such dynamic systems have no predefined configurations and user interfaces, traditional evaluation methods often fall short or are even inappropriate. Obviously, a host of factors influence the extent to which a PLE successfully supports a learner to achieve specific learning outcomes. We categorize such factors along four major dimensions: technological, organizational, psycho-pedagogical, and social. Each dimension is informed by relevant theoretical models (e.g., Information System Success Model, Community of Practice, self-regulated learning) and subsumes a set of metrics that can be assessed with a range of approaches. Among others, usability and user experience play an indispensable role in acceptance and diffusion of the innovative technologies exemplified by PLEs. Traditional quantitative and qualitative methods such as questionnaire and interview should be deployed alongside emergent ones such as learning analytics (e.g., context-aware metadata) and narrative-based methods. Crucial for maximal validity of the evaluation is the triangulation of empirical findings with multi-perspective (end-users, developers, and researchers), mixed-method (qualitative, quantitative) data sources. The framework utilizes a cyclic process to integrate findings across cases with a cross-case analysis in order to gain deeper insights into the intriguing questions of how and why PLEs work.

JO  - Archives of Sexual Behavior
SP  - 1161
EP  - 1179
VL  - 46
IS  - 5
AB  - Category-specific sexual response describes a pattern wherein the individual shows significantly greater responses to preferred versus nonpreferred categories of sexual stimuli; this pattern is described as gender specific for sexual orientation to gender, or gender nonspecific if lacking response differentiation by gender cues. Research on the gender specificity of women’s sexual response has consistently produced sexual orientation effects, such that androphilic women (sexually attracted to adult males) typically show gender-nonspecific patterns of genital response and gynephilic women (sexually attracted to adult females) show more gender-specific responses. As research on the category specificity of sexual response has grown, this pattern has also been observed for other measures of sexual response. In this review, I use the Incentive Motivation and Information Processing Models as complementary frameworks to organize the empirical literature examining the gender specificity of women’s sexual response at each stage of sexual stimulus processing and response. Collectively, these data disconfirm models of sexual orientation that equate androphilic women’s sexual attractions with their sexual responses to sexual stimuli. I then discuss 10 hypotheses that might explain variability in the specificity of sexual response among androphilic and gynephilic women, and conclude with recommendations for future research on the (non)specificity of sexual response.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of methodological approaches and current work in the evaluation of user engagement (UE). Using a series of propositions about the nature of engagement, I review a selection of recent research that utilizes varied methodological approaches to study UE in various human-computer interaction settings. The propositions and the reviewed literature are used to propose a methodological framework to guide decision making and reflection regarding how UE will be evaluated in a given context. The chapter concludes with reflections on broader issues related to how researchers’ methodological stances influence the evaluation of UE. Overall, the chapter argues that UE should be measured using a thoughtful mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, considering the particulars of the use context, and balancing established and emerging subjective and objective metrics.

AB  - In this chapter the authors have surveyed the methodological perspectives seen as important for assessing twenty-first century skills. Some of those issues are specific to twenty-first century skills, but the majority would apply more generally to the assessment of other psychological and educational variables. The narrative of the paper initially follows the logic of assessment development, commencing by defining constructs to be assessed, designing tasks that can be used to generate informative student responses, coding/valuing of those responses, delivering the tasks and gathering the responses, and modeling the responses in accordance with the constructs. The paper continues with a survey of the strands of validity evidence that need to be established, and a discussion of specific issues that are prominent in this context, such as the need to resolve issues of generality versus contextual specificity; the relationships of classroom to large-scale assessments; and the possible roles for technological advances in assessing these skills. There is also a brief segment discussing some issues that arise with respect to specific types of variables involved in the assessment of twenty-first century skills. The chapter concludes with a listing of particular challenges that are regarded as being prominent at the time of writing. There is an annexure that describes specific approaches to assessment design that are useful in the development of new assessments.

AB  - No matter how powerful or elegant the technologies underlying multimedia computing, it is the user interface that ultimately determines how these systems will be used. We provide an overview of two emerging areas of user-interface research that will play major roles in future multimedia systems: virtual environments and ubiquitous computing. We discuss what they are and why they are important, and describe their relationship to current multimedia systems. While mouse and window-based user interfaces provide access to 2D graphics, video, and sound, virtual environments not only involve interactive 3D graphics, but further address all our senses through the use of spatial audio, haptics, and other modalities. While it is still a research goal to provide high-throughput video on demand, ubiquitous computing will require that multimedia network infrastructure also support extremely low-latency interaction among large numbers of mobile wireless users. To arrive at an understanding of the needs, capabilities, and potential of these new paradigms, we introduce their terminology and technology, and explain the basic system architectures being explored, leading up to a discussion of key current research issues and future directions.

However, signs point to the dormant power of context recognition: Advertising systems that can adapt to the situational context of a consumer will rapidly gain importance. While technologies that can sense the environment are increasingly advanced, questions such as what to sense and how to adapt to a consumer’s context are largely unanswered. In this chapter, we analyze the purchase context of a retail outlet and conceptualize it such that adaptive pervasive advertising applications really deliver on their potential: showing the right message at the right time to the right recipient.

In accordance to this great bandwidth of design and adaption works, a development and validation platform is of substantial need. Among the validation tools recommended by the European Operational Concept Validation Methodology (E-OCVM), simulations play a crucial role. Within the present chapter, three aspects of simulation experiments are presented and discussed which are specific for RTO research: (1) the different usage of scenarios in fast- and real-time simulation tools, (2) new and specific requirements for RTO simulations, and (3) development of the specific resilient simulation setups for RTO research as driving force, with emphasis on the redesign of human-in-the-loop simulations.

PB  - Springer India
CY  - New Delhi
AB  - Every person has a unique cognitive profile. Biological makeup, life experiences and different abilities affect cognitive processing. Therefore, cognitive processing models and their predictions should not be generalized to all cases without due thought. Everybody’s attention and linguistic capacities are constrained by several psychological, social and cultural factors. Any theory of attention–language interaction has to consider how individual differences manifest in such interactions. All speakers and listeners are not equal in terms of the amount of uses of language or the cognitive environments they find themselves in. This chapter deals with how one’s linguistic profile can fine tune attentional processes or vice versa. The chapter will explore how bilingualism affects one’s cognitive system, particularly the executive control system and attention in a range of situations. The chapter also discusses how formal literacy level as a cognitive predictor influences attentional mechanisms. These considerations are important in today’s world of changing socio-cultural boundaries and greater heterogeneity in human contacts. The chapter will also consider language users from diverse linguistic traditions, who speak lesser studied languages and may find themselves operating with a completely different set of cognitive structures. In earlier chapters, we saw that attention is required for several language activities; here, we will see that language use in turn affects attention.

AB  - The wide variety of technological devices is a barrier to satisfactory usage and learning over all. Different types of interface element distribution and dissimilarities of their functionalities, even in the same category of products under the same brand, can steepen the learning curve to effective device operation. Interface design can be understood as a mechanism for the adequacy of the technological environment to substantially improve performance, satisfaction and life of the user with special requirements. Based on an inclusive paradigm, we aim to improve the usability, accessibility and satisfiability of the interface for a specific group of users, such as novice elderly, to benefit all types of users in their daily lives. The requirements derived from a holistic analysis of user, goals and context lead to the introduction of the AGILE Interface (Assisted Guided Interaction with no Learning nor Experience required). This interface is the pillar of a new interaction style designed to assist and guide users with specific needs owing to age and non-Information and Technology experience. In the context of present-day technology interactions, the ultimate goal of this work is to move beyond out of date user stereotypes to tailor appropriate interface design adapted to realistic and specific user demands.

AB  - This chapter discusses the methodological framework for the empirical research on cycling and motorcycling tourism. Taking a critical realist approach to create knowledge, it illustrates the four-phased, mixed-method strategy later used to collect empirical evidence. It reflects upon the rationale for every methodological choice, illustrates the data collection process and reflects upon the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods. Several of these methods are critically presented: case study research, mobile video ethnography, ride-alongs, bio-sensing techniques, and self-report and observation techniques for emotion measurement, including facial action coding systems. Finally, the introduction of thick description and personas design as tools to integrate quantitative and qualitative data allows for a structured planning of the convergence of evidence from the multiple methodological sources.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 1900
EP  - 1908
VL  - 25
IS  - 5
AB  - The home of human language use is face-to-face interaction, a context in which communicative exchanges are characterised not only by bodily signals accompanying what is being said but also by a pattern of alternating turns at talk. This transition between turns is astonishingly fast—typically a mere 200-ms elapse between a current and a next speaker’s contribution—meaning that comprehending, producing, and coordinating conversational contributions in time is a significant challenge. This begs the question of whether the additional information carried by bodily signals facilitates or hinders language processing in this time-pressured environment. We present analyses of multimodal conversations revealing that bodily signals appear to profoundly influence language processing in interaction: Questions accompanied by gestures lead to shorter turn transition times—that is, to faster responses—than questions without gestures, and responses come earlier when gestures end before compared to after the question turn has ended. These findings hold even after taking into account prosodic patterns and other visual signals, such as gaze. The empirical findings presented here provide a first glimpse of the role of the body in the psycholinguistic processes underpinning human communication.

AB  - Spontaneous gestures that accompany speech are related to both verbal and spatial processes. We argue that gestures emerge from perceptual and motor simulations that underlie embodied language and mental imagery. We first review current thinking about embodied cognition, embodied language, and embodied mental imagery. We then provide evidence that gestures stem from spatial representations and mental images. We then propose the gestures-as-simulated-action framework to explain how gestures might arise from an embodied cognitive system. Finally, we compare this framework with other current models of gesture production, and we briefly outline predictions that derive from the framework.

SP  - 55

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Dispatcher’s error is an important factor affecting the safe operation of power system. One of the main causes of human error is inappropriate workload. Due to the particularity of the power dispatching work process, existing workload measures are not ideal for power dispatcher. According to the human information processing model, combined with the actual work of dispatchers, this article proposed a novel method for dispatcher workload assessment. It considered dispatcher’s workload from four dimensions: information perception, speech output, action output and attention. Video, audio and physiological monitor were deployed to acquire descriptive features. The frequency of incoming calls was extracted to describe information perception. Short-term energy and spectral entropy of the speech signal were extracted to describe speech output. Body movement speed was extracted to describe action output and heart rate was used to describe attention. The method was applied to an experiment in the dispatcher training simulator involving qualified power dispatchers. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was applicable and it can effectively reflect changes of dispatcher’s workload during troubleshooting tasks.

JO  - Behavior Research Methods
SP  - 256
EP  - 270
VL  - 37
IS  - 2
AB  - ProtoMatch is a software tool for integrating and analyzing fixed-location and movement eye gaze and cursor data. It provides a comprehensive collection of protocol analysis tools that support sequential data analyses for eye fixations and scanpaths as well as for cursor “fixations” (dwells at one location) and “cursorpaths” (movements between locations). ProtoMatch is modularized software that integrates both eye gaze and cursor protocols into a unified stream of data and provides an assortment of filters and analyses. ProtoMatch subsumes basic analyses (i.e., fixation duration, number of fixations, etc.) and introduces a method of objectively computing the similarity between scanpaths or cursorpaths using sequence alignment. The combination of filters, basic analyses, and sequence alignment in ProtoMatch provides researchers with a versatile system for performing both confirmatory and exploratory sequential data analyses (Sanderson & Fisher, 1994).

AB  - The study of micro-expressions has undergone a big change as a result of contemporary development in the areas of human–computer interaction (HCI) and affective computing. This chapter will highlight the need for the study of micro-expressions. It would focus on two major approaches to evolve parameters for the automatic detection of human facial expressions—the facial action coding system (FACS) and facial animation parameters (FAPs). Besides summarizing the major developments in the area of psychology and other areas, it would also explore the ways in which neuropsychological studies can contribute to this domain of knowledge.

AB  - This article reviews the role of relevance in text processing. It argues that relevance instructions provided by instructors and texts help readers identify text segments that are germane to a reading goal. A taxonomy of relevance instructions is presented and four basic types of relevance manipulations are considered (i.e., targeted segments, elaborative interrogation, perspective, and purpose). This article also describes a four-stage goal-focusing model to explain how relevance affects attention allocation and text understanding. Directions for future research and educational implications are also discussed.

JO  - Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
SP  - 1464
EP  - 1487
VL  - 81
IS  - 5
AB  - Temporal organization of human behavior is particularly important when several action requirements must be processed around the same time. A crucial challenge in such multitasking situations is to control the temporal response order. However, multitasking studies usually focus on temporal processing dynamics after a specific response order – which is usually triggered by stimulus sequence and instructions – has been determined, whereas a comprehensive study of response-order scheduling mechanisms is still lacking. Across three psychological refractory period (PRP) experiments, we examined the impact of stimulus order, response characteristics, and several other factors on response order. Crucially, we utilized a combination of effector systems (oculomotor and manual) that are known to ensure reasonable response order variability in the first place. The results suggest that – contrary to previous assumptions – bottom-up factors (e.g., stimulus order) are not the primary determinant of temporal action scheduling. Instead, we found a major influence of effector-based characteristics (i.e., oculomotor task prioritization) that could be attenuated by both instructions and changes in the task environment (providing temporally predictable input). Effects of between-task compatibility suggest that a dedicated stimulus-code comparison process precedes and affects response-order scheduling. Based on the present results and previous findings, we propose a multi-phase framework of temporal response-order control that emphasizes the extent to which cognitive control of action scheduling is dynamically adaptive to particular task characteristics.

AB  - In this chapter, I discuss work on cognitive processes and timing, and review some fairly recent research on emotion and timing as well. Cognitive processes and timing have been linked in various ways in the literature. Multi-process models of timing like SET, for example, with its tripartite division into clock memory and decision processes, embed the basic timing mechanism in a more complex cognitive framework, what Treisman (2013) called the “clockwork” of the timing system, as opposed to the clock itself. The link is even more evident in recent multi-process models such as that of Taatgen, van Rijn, and Anderson (2007), where a timing mechanism is used as a “front end” to the ACT-R system (Anderson et al., 2004), which has been widely used to account for performance on many non-timing tasks.

CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Bayesian models involving Dirichlet process mixtures are at the heart of the modern nonparametric Bayesian movement. Much of the rapid development of these models in the last decade has been a direct result of advances in simulation-based computational methods. Some of the very early work in this area, circa 1988-1991, focused on the use of such nonparametric ideas and models in applications of otherwise standard hierarchical models. This chapter provides some historical review and perspective on these developments, with a prime focus on the use and integration of such nonparametric ideas in hierarchical models. We illustrate the ease with which the strict parametric assumptions common to most standard Bayesian hierarchical models can be relaxed to incorporate uncertainties about functional forms using Dirichlet process components, partly enabled by the approach to computation using MCMC methods. The resulting methodology is illustrated with two examples taken from an unpublished 1992 report on the topic.

CY  - Singapore
AB  - The present contribution examines an interesting but technically quite imperfect sample recording in the CRITT Centre’s TPR-database in an attempt to demonstrate how imperfect gaze data can be meaningfully reconstructed and to illustrate and explore details of translational keystroke and gaze behaviour in a single translator. The data clearly show that translation proceeds segment by segment. A source text (ST) segment is read, comprehended, and translated. As the translation is typed, we see it emerging segment by segment. Perfectly smooth production of target text across extended stretches of time is not frequently seen, but is often approximated. Highly expert performers are able to bind processing segments together into a flow of continuous production. From their recorded gaze behaviour, we can observe that experts do process text segment by segment, so how is it that they can manage to sometimes maintain fairly continuous production? Evidence of how reading, comprehension, translation, formulation and typing activities are coordinated is found in recorded gaze data, which provide detailed evidence of what ST text unit was being worked on at any given point in time, and evidence provided by keystrokes. These combined sources of evidence can be used to infer both what ST (sub)segment was being processed within what ST context, and in what manner, always with the big unknowns at play of the translator’s knowledge, memory, meaning construction intelligence and expressive power – and the suspicion that the human brain is doing a good deal more than eye movements and keystrokes reveal.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore possible cerebral asymmetries in the processing of decomposable and nondecomposable idioms by fluent nonnative speakers of English. In the study, native language (Polish) and foreign language (English) decomposable and nondecomposable idioms were embedded in ambiguous (neutral) and unambiguous (biasing figurative meaning) context and presented centrally, followed by laterally presented target words related to the figurative meaning of the idiom or literal meaning of the last word of the idiom. The target appeared either immediately at sentence offset (Experiment 1), or 400 ms (Experiment 2) after sentence offset. Results are inconsistent with the Idiom Decomposition Hypothesis (Gibbs et al. in Mem Cogn 17:58–68, 1989a; J Mem Lang 28:576–593, 1989b) and only partially consistent with the idea of the differential cerebral involvement in processing (non)decomposable idioms [the Fine/Coarse Coding Theory, Beeman (Right hemisphere language comprehension: perspectives from cognitive neuroscience, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 1998)]. A number of factors, rather than compositionality per se, emerge as crucial in determining idiom processing, such as language status (native vs. nonnative), salience, or context.

AB  - With human-computer interaction, the embodied existence of the human – that is, its situatedness in a specific time and context – obviously plays an important role. At least this should seem obvious. How – or even if – embodiment is addressed, though, varies throughout the history of the field. It changes with the specific settings, the variety of affordances, and the technical possibilities and developments. The anthropomorphic interface, with its aim to mirror the human, brings a new quality to the research field. The design goal is now a machine counterpart that resembles human bodies and behavior.

CY  - Cham
AB  - It is usually taken for granted that Direct Manipulation is the best interaction style for inexperienced or non-expert users; moreover, this style of interaction is generally considered the best for almost every situation and user. The recent shifts in technology that we all are currently experiencing have given rise to a great deal of new kinds of users performing specific tasks in a variety of scenarios. In this paper, we focus on users who access a system occasionally, infrequently, or in an unplanned way; i.e., users who do not want or cannot afford a learning curve. We show that for them, Direct Manipulation is not always the most suitable style of interaction. We assess the advantages of guiding this kind of users, in particular through the guided interaction framework known as Goal Driven Interaction. GDI can be viewed as a superset of wizards providing support far beyond a few steps through dialogs. Indeed, GDI is an interaction style with characteristics of its own. We report a complete user test that backs up previous hypotheses. The analysis of empirical data proves that GDI is more time-efficient than DM, requiring fewer moderator assistances for the users. Post-test questionnaires confirmed that participants had a strong preference for GDI.

SP  - 115
EP  - 144
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - We provide an overview of fuzzy-trace theory (FTT) and its implications for risk and time preferences, drawing on evidence from behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience. FTT’s central construct is mental representation, specifically verbatim (literal surface form) and gist (bottom-line meaning) representations. The differences between these types of representation determine risk and time preferences, in combination with social values as well as developmental and individual differences. In particular, sensitivity to rewards and inhibitory control vary across the life span and across people, but impulsivity and risk taking can be modified by applying principles of FTT. We discuss the origins of FTT in prospect theory and distinguish risk preference, impulsivity versus intuition, temporal discounting (i.e., delay discounting), and delay of gratification, as well as FTT’s approach compared to standard dual-process models of judgment and decision making. As we discuss, there are parallels in FTT’s explanations of people’s willingness to tolerate risk as well as their willingness to wait for future rewards. FTT predicts theoretically crucial effects, such as increasing cognitive biases from childhood to adulthood, greater “rational” analysis among adolescents compared to adults, elimination of gain–loss biases through truncation of zero parts of gambles in risky choice framing, and hidden-zero effects in temporal discounting. We conclude that FTT yields qualitatively different interpretations of risk preference and time preference compared to other theories and that it offers new approaches to understanding and improving problem behaviors.

JO  - Memory & Cognition
SP  - 509

VL  - 14
IS  - 6
AB  - In Experiment 1, subjects read sentences containing a category name or a neutral prime that was followed by a target exemplar that varied in typicality. Fixation time on the target exemplar was the measure of processing difficulty. The category name facilitated processing for both high- and low-typicality exemplars. Unexpectedly, high-typicality exemplars were processed more quickly than low-typicality exemplars in both primed and unprimed conditions. Experiment 2 extended the priming effect to primary associates. Most importantly, the priming effect was influenced by the syntactic structure of the stimulus sentence. When both the prime and the associated target word were in the same clause, semantic priming occurred, but when the prime and target were in different clauses, no associative facilitation was observed. These results were interpreted as supporting a clausal processing hypothesis based on an autonomous modular view of the language processing system. Furthermore, the results were consistent with direct control models of eye movements, which claim that fixation duration reflects the timing of processing related to the word currently under fixation.

BT  - Diagrammatic Representation and Inference
SP  - 337
EP  - 339
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - A challenges for learning from animated diagrams is to first parse the continuous flow of information into discrete event units. Inadequacies in this parsing process can prejudice the quality of the mental model constructed from the depiction. One approach that has been proposed for ameliorating such problems is for the designer to pre-segment the animation. However, the pre-segmentation techniques used tend to be either intuitive or based on an expert’s understanding of the subject matter. Neither of these approaches takes proper account of the psychological processing that must occur for an external animation to be properly internalized. This poster reports a study of the processes that learners spontaneously use when asked to segment whole animations into events. It compared segmentation of two contrasting diagram types, one representing a mechanical system and the other a biological system. The number of events identified was low relative to the number that were actually present. There were deficiencies in participants’ placement of event boundaries and in their characterization of inter-event relationships. Identification of events in the mechanical system proceeded from micro to macro, this order was reversed with the biological system.

EP  - 679
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This project aims to present a methodology to study the relationships between physiological measures and evaluation metrics for 3D interaction techniques using methods for multivariate data analysis. Physiological responses, such as heart rate and skin conductance, offer objective data about the user stress during interaction. This could be useful, for instance, to evaluate qualitative aspects of interaction techniques without relying on solely subjective data. Moreover, these data could contribute to improve task performance analysis by measuring different responses to 3D interaction techniques. With this in mind, we propose a methodology that defines a testing protocol, a normalization procedure and statistical techniques, considering the use of physiological measures during the evaluation process. A case study comparison between two 3D interaction techniques (ray-casting and HOMER) shows promising results, pointing to heart rate variability, as measured by the NN50 parameter, as a potential index of task performance. Further studies are needed in order to establish guidelines for evaluation processes based on well-defined associations between human behaviors and human actions realized in 3D user interfaces.

AB  - In this chapterProcess model, we proposeInformation processing modela systemicSystemic cognitionmodel of thinkingThinking(SysTM) to account for higher cognitive operations such as how an agentAgentmakes inferences, solves problems and makes decisions. The SysTM model conceives thinking as a cognitive processCognitive processthat evolves in time and space and results in a new cognitive eventEvent(i.e., a new solution to a problem). This presupposes that such cognitive events are emerging from cognitive interactivity, which we define as the meshed networkNetworkof reciprocal causations between an agent’s mental processing and the transformative actions she applies to her immediate environment to achieve a cognitive result. To explain how cognitive interactivity resultsResultin cognitive events, SysTM builds upon the classical informationInformationprocessing model but breaks from the view that cognitive events result from a linear information processingInformation processingpath originating in the perception of a problem stimulus that is mentally processed to produce a cognitive event. Instead, SysTM holds that information processing in thinkingThinkingevolves through a succession of deductive and inductive processing loops. Both loops give rise to transformative actions on the physical informationInformationlayout, resulting in new perceptual inputsInputwhich inform the next processing loop. Such actions result from the enaction of mental actionActionplans in deductive loops and from unplanned direct perception of action possibilities or affordancesAffordancein inductive loops. To account for direct perception, we introduce the concept of an affordance pool to refer to a short term memory storage of action possibilities in working memoryMemory. We conclude by illustrating how SysTM can be used to derive new predictions and guide the study of cognitive interactivity in thinking.

JO  - Memory & Cognition
SP  - 1107
EP  - 1121
VL  - 35
IS  - 5
AB  - An eye-movement-monitoring experiment tested readers’ responses to sentences containing relative clauses that could be attached to one or both of two preceding nouns. Previous experiments with such sentences have indicated that globally ambiguous relative clauses are processed more quickly than are determinately attached relative clauses. Central to the present research, a recent study (Swets, Desmet, Hambrick, & Ferreira, 2007) showed that offline preferences for such sentences differ as a function of working memory capacity. Specifically, both English and Dutch participants’ preference for the second of two nouns as the host for the relative clause increased as their working memory capacity increased. In the present study, readers’ working memory capacity was measured, and eye movements were monitored. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to determine whether working memory capacity moderated readers’ online processing performance. The modeling indicated that determinately attached sentences were harder to process than globally ambiguous sentences, that working memory did not affect processing of the relative clause itself, but that working memory did moderate how easy it was to integrate the relative clause with the preceding sentence context. Specifically, in contrast with the offline results from Swets and colleagues’ study, readers with higher working memory capacity were more likely to prefer the first noun over the second noun as the host for the relative clause.

JO  - Research on Language and Computation
SP  - 293
EP  - 309
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
AB  - The speech signal is inherently ambiguous and all computational and behavioral research on speech perception has implicitly or explicitly investigated the mechanism of resolution of this ambiguity. It is clear that context and prior probability (i.e., frequency) play central roles in resolving ambiguities between possible speech sounds and spoken words (speech perception) as well as between meanings and senses of a word (semantic ambiguity resolution). However, the mechanisms of these effects are still under debate. Recent advances in understanding context and frequency effects in speech perception suggest promising approaches to investigating semantic ambiguity resolution. This review begins by motivating the use of insights from speech perception to understand the mechanisms of semantic ambiguity resolution. Key to this motivation is the description of the structural similarity between the two domains with a focus on two parallel sets of findings: context strength effects, and an attractor dynamics account for the contrasting patterns of inhibition and facilitation due to ambiguity. The main part of the review then discusses three recent, influential sets of findings in speech perception, which suggest that (1) top-down contextual and bottom-up perceptual information interact to mutually constrain processing of ambiguities, (2) word frequency influences on-line access, rather than response biases or resting levels, and (3) interactive integration of top-down and bottom-up information is optimal given the noisy, yet highly constrained nature of real-world communication, despite the possible consequence of illusory perceptions. These findings and the empirical methods behind them provide auspicious future directions for the study of semantic ambiguity resolution.

AB  - Risk communication is about exchanging risk information and opinions, and influences how people perceive and act on risks. This chapter first describes how risk communicators attract people’s attention and present information. Then the chapter explores what influences understanding and acceptance or rejection of messages, with a focus on uncertainty and mental models. Next, the chapter describes how people evaluate and use risk messages and how risk messaging relates to behavioral tendencies and behavioral responses, with an emphasis on choice architecture and habits. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the importance of matching risk communication goals and methods to audience attributes.

SP  - 266
EP  - 281
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Current approaches to the design of educational animations too often appear to be largely founded upon intuition rather than research-based principles. Animated diagrams designed to be behaviourally realistic run the risk of learners overlooking vital high relevance information that has low intrinsic perceptual salience. The information that learners extract from such representations is a poor basis upon which to build high quality dynamic mental models. For animated diagrams to be effective as tools for learning, their design should be based upon explicit and principled modeling of the way learners process such depictions. This paper synthesizes recent research to propose a theoretical framework for learners’ perceptual and conceptual processing of animated diagrams. A five-stage model is presented that characterizes the role of different levels of processing in building dynamic mental models of the depicted content.

AB  - This book deals with attentional processes in human language processing. Before getting into the empirical research, it is important to sketch a brief history of this line of inquiry. This history deals with psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology, as well as broad areas of cognitive science, some foundational issues related to the interaction between attention, language, vision and memory. The chapter also presents material that suggests that the study of attentional mechanisms in language go back to the early days of experimental psychology. The chapter shows that the rejection of Fodor-type ‘modularity’ in many quarters, the shrinking appeal of Chomskyan linguistics among interdisciplinary workers, and the rise of alternative frameworks both in psychology and linguistics led to a new landscape in this area of research. The chapter covers major episodes in this history to show that contemporary interest in language and attention research is an outcome of several revisions in important ideas.

AB  - Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are discussed in the context of being used by users coming from the “bottom of the pyramid” to interact with and to run ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) applications for real life usage in their developing world. These interfaces are called “GUI 4D” (Graphical User Interfaces for Development). GUI 4D methodologies are a key aspect in enabling the users in the bottom of the pyramid to become part—within their own needs and capabilities—of integrated value/business chains, and also in finally closing both the digital and the social gap. They are presented and discussed here first from a technical and from an implementation point of view and considerations are also given on how the corresponding requirements, constraints and specifications are developed and used for GUI 4D implementations. Several examples, case studies and use cases from ongoing research projects, from existing pilots and prototypes and from related initiatives in Africa are presented. Some analysis of system adoption and the perceived benefits from using GUI 4D’s are then given and discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief consideration of target applications and markets for GUI 4D’s in the developing world, taking into consideration the dependencies and needs between the established and the informal economy in these countries. An extensive set of references used or related to the subject is given at the end of the chapter.

AB  - Traditional shopping malls experience the effects of expanding online shopping. In addition, social media grew as a platform for customer orientation and expression. In-mall retail must respond. We take the customer journey as the guiding model for customer experience building and focus on converting cross-channel built customer expectation into enriched customer experiences in in-mall stores. We focus on the in-mall part of the journey but recognize the need to engage with customers in other parts of the journey and on social media. That is where the word-of-mouth spreads nowadays. We develop a ‘u-retail’ process model and a cyber-physical system concept for a mall: we combine a mall website, mobile apps and interactive storefronts containing Facebook processes into an integrating system. Customers can manipulate info and processes displayed on the interactive storefront through touch or mobile devices. The Facebook shopping-with-online-friends process inserts real-time feedback from social media friends in the storefront window. We show how ‘gamification’ and trust and loyalty breeding can be employed. Mall and retailers attract customers in a collective manner, from parking services to package deals. Cross-channel customer tracking is part of the concept, providing a view on both online and offline communities. Ubiquitous tracking of customers foster deep customer relation and experience of data. We implemented a first partly surrogate prototype to validate the concept. This partly empirical, partly designed experimental implementation can itself be a big data tool for scientists and retailers to acquire deeper insights. The concept can be generalized to other social contexts.

AB  - Traditional capture and display devices can only support a limited dynamic range (contrast) and color gamut given the hardware limitations. As a result, the real physical luminance present in a natural scene cannot be captured by these. However, with the recent advancements in the related software and hardware technologies, it is now possible to capture or reproduce higher contrast and luminance ranges. Such scene-referred visual signals are known as high dynamic range (HDR) signals. They are visually more appealing because they can represent the dynamic range of the visual stimuli present in the real world more accurately. Not surprisingly, the emergence of HDR is seen as an important step towards improving the visual quality of experience (QoE) of the end users. However, HDR comes with its own set of challenges including capture, storage, processing, display, and so on. This chapter focuses on some of those issues from a QoE viewpoint.

AB  - In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of both cognitive and genetic approaches to mental health in order to encourage greater collaboration between those who typically take a cognitive approach to experimental psychopathology and those working in molecular genetics, who typically take a more biological approach. Because of the extensive nature of both fields, our review is necessarily selective. Nevertheless, we hope that this chapter will encourage greater interdisciplinary collaboration between geneticists and cognitive clinical scientists in a quest to deepen our understanding of psychopathology and psychological well-being. We believe that there are many opportunities for researchers to combine forces to help us move closer to understanding why some individuals appear to be particularly vulnerable to emotional disorders while others seem to be more resilient to the onset of disorder.

TI  - Regression analyses as a tool for studying reading processes: Comment on Just and Carpenters eye fixation theory
JO  - Memory & Cognition

VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - Just and Carpenter (1980) presented a theory of reading based on eye fixations wherein their “psycholinguistic” variables accounted for 72% of the variance in word gaze durations. This comment raises some statistical and theoretical problems with their use of simultaneous regression analysis of gaze duration measures and with the resulting theory of reading. A major problem was the confounding of perceptual with psycholinguistic factors. New eye fixation data are presented to support these criticisms. Analysis of fixations within words revealed that most gaze duration variance was contributed by number of fixations rather than by fixation duration.

VL  - 38
IS  - 3
AB  - The verb has traditionally been characterized as the central element in a sentence. Nevertheless, the exact role of the verb during the actual ongoing comprehension of a sentence as it unfolds in time remains largely unknown. This paper reports the results of two Cross-Modal Lexical Priming (CMLP) experiments detailing the pattern of verb priming during on-line processing of Dutch sentences. Results are contrasted with data from a third CMLP experiment on priming of nouns in similar sentences. It is demonstrated that the meaning of a matrix verb remains active throughout the entire matrix clause, while this is not the case for the meaning of a subject head noun. Activation of the meaning of the verb only dissipates upon encountering a clear signal as to the start of a new clause.

AB  - Competitive sports generate powerful emotional responses among both participants and spectators. It also has been proven that the emotions experienced by players prior to and during the sports can have a profound effect upon the quality of their performances, especially in competitive sports like tennis which has been described as an emotionally demanding game where emphasis is given on training of player’s mentality for their success. Successful measurement of emotions is a challenging task and there have been a very few research on measurement of emotions using technology in sports. This paper reports the use of two wearable technology, Apple Watch Series 2 and NeuroSky MindWave headset, in measuring emotional responses amongst tennis players. Experiments were conducted to measure the heart rates and EEG (electroencephalography) responses to categorise emotions and then to compare the results with the subjective ground truths scored by each participant. The results demonstrate statistically significant relationships between the objective and subjective measures of emotions indicating the use of wearable devices as a legitimate method of measuring emotional responses in a competitive sport like tennis.

AB  - The Center for Innovation of Translation and Translation Technology (CRITT) environment at Copenhagen Business School (CBS) draws on primarily two types of NLP resources, namely treebanks and the logging of user activity data (UAD) during text production and translation activities, in order to do research into the cognitive processes that lie behind translation activity. In this paper we make a short presentation of the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank (CDT), and elaborate how UAD is obtained and represented in Translog-II. Finally, the paper discusses some general perspectives on how process-oriented translation research methodology could benefit from the integration of UAD with structural linguistic information in the form of linguistically annotated text data.

BT  - Comprehensive Guide to Autism
SP  - 1043
EP  - 1059
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Faces have immense importance for social interactions. Faces convey information about our intentions, our identity, and our emotional state. Although most people recognize faces effortlessly with little or no forethought, children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) struggle with their face recognition skills. Studies have shown that unlike typically developed children, children with ASD do not readily orient and attend to faces in the environment. Even when they are attending to a face, children with ASD tend not to look at the eyes and are more likely to miss information about the identity and emotional state of a person. In addition, children with ASD tend to analyze a face in terms of its individual parts (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) rather than integrating the individual features into a holistic face memory. If children with autism lack basic skills in face processing, it is not surprising that they would experience difficulty in everyday interactions that depend heavily on the perceptual understanding of facial cues. Recently, computer-based methods, such as the Face Expertise Training and Let’s Face It! (LFI!) program, have been developed to improve the face processing skills of children with ASD. These programs assume that the perceptual skills involved in face recognition can be acquired and improved through systematic training. Results from these programs have been proven effective in teaching children with ASD how to recognize facial identity. Moreover, the development of new technologies, such as touch screen tablets and virtual reality systems, is promising for improving the face processing of children with ASD.

SP  - 531
EP  - 571
VL  - 31
IS  - 5
AB  - We report the results from three cross-modal lexical decision experiments investigating antecedent priming effects in Japanese. In the first two experiments we examined antecedent reactivation at the preverbal trace position in long-distance scrambling sentences. We found an interaction between the participants' working memory (WM) span and antecedent priming. For the high span group, the magnitude of antecedent priming at the trace position was significantly larger than at the earlier control position; for the low span group, on the other hand, there was no such difference. In a third experiment, we examined whether similar reactivation effects could be observed for argument expressions that are not base-generated adjacent to the verb. Contrary to scrambled objects, subject noun phrases (NPs) in canonically ordered sentences were not reactivated at the preverbal test position in either of the two participant groups. We argue that the priming effect observed in the high span group supports a trace-based account of long-distance scrambling. The degree of complexity of the experimental sentences was such that they exceeded the memory span of the low span group. We conclude that argument traces access their antecedents irrespective of the position of their subcategorizers.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Many learning tasks require students to induce higher-order relationships from the learning material. Compare and contrast processes play a pivotal role in solving such inductive tasks. Different presentations of animation episodes offer affordances to students that can either impede or facilitate compare and contrast processes. While conventional behaviorally realistic animations typically present multiple episodes one after the other, i.e. sequentially, simultaneous presentation offers a feasible alternative. We investigated how the sequential and simultaneous presentation of multiple animation episodes affects students’ perceptual interrogation of the animation as well as their learning of higher-order relationships. Of the 60 students who participated in the experimental study, one half studied the animation episodes presented sequentially and the other half studied the same episodes presented simultaneously. The eye movements of eight participants from each group were recorded while they studied the animation episodes. The simultaneous presentation resulted in significantly more visual transitions between the episodes than the sequential version. Furthermore, significantly more bi-directional visual transitions occurred in case of the simultaneous presentation than for the sequential presentation. Learning of higher-order relationships was significantly more successful from simultaneously presented episodes than from sequentially presented episodes.

AB  - We present a novel recommendation algorithm for browsing assistance systems. The algorithm efficiently utilizes a priori knowledge of human interactions in electronic environments. The human interactions are segmented according to the temporal dynamics. Larger behavioral segments – sessions – are divided into smaller segments – subsequences. The observations indicate that users’ attention is primarily focused on the starting and the ending points of subsequences. The presented algorithm offers recommendations at these essential navigation points. The recommendation set comprises of suitably selected desirable targets of the observed subsequences and the consecutive initial navigation points. The algorithm has been evaluated on a real-world data of a large-scale organizational intranet portal. The portal has extensive number of resources, significant traffic, and large knowledge worker user base. The experimental results indicate satisfactory performance.

AB  - Biometrics are increasingly being used as a tool for identification and verification and are currently being implemented in access control situations, such as for border control. Biometrics are often used for such purposes on the assumption that it provides greater accuracy and security than humans performing these tasks and that there is the potential for greater efficiency in terms of processing times and resources. Nevertheless, the introduction of a biometric system, particularly where there are potential security implications, warrants considered evaluation before the system becomes operational. Preliminary evaluation may involve factory-acceptance testing, user-acceptance testing and scenario-based trials to determine likely operational performance. However, the most accurate assessment of system performance is obtained by an operational trial involving real travellers. This assessment should seek to determine: the operational performance of the biometric algorithm; how users (novice and experienced) interact with the system; and whether this interaction may impact on current and future business processes, as well as on the quality of the biometric samples obtained. This chapter presents a systems approach for evaluating traveller processing systems in the operational environment when implementing a new system or comparing an old with a new system. A system-level approach, that takes into account both technical performance and the impact of human factors issues, is recommended to provide a complete understanding of overall system performance, as well as identify potential improvements to enhance performance and/or useability.

TI  - Cognitive processes underlying distributional preferences: a response time study
JO  - Experimental Economics
AB  - There is ample evidence that people differ considerably in their preferences. We identify individual heterogeneity in type and strength of social preferences in a series of binary three-person dictator games. Based on this identification, we analyze response times in another series of games to investigate the cognitive processes of distributional preferences. We find that response time increases with the number of conflicts between individually relevant motives and decreases with the utility difference between choice options. The selfish motive is more intuitive for subjects who are more selfish. Our findings indicate that the sequential sampling process and the intuition of selfishness jointly produce distribution decisions, and provide an explanation for the mixed results on the correlations between response time and prosociality. Our results also show that it is important to take heterogeneity of preferences into account when investigating the cognitive processes of social decision making.

AB  - Human factors is a field dedicated to studying how to improve work environments based on human capabilities and limitations. There are many areas where human factors can improve surgery, especially as surgery continues to evolve and new tools, technology, and techniques are developed. Simulation offers a safe and ideal environment to study, train, and assess the application of human factors principles to surgery. This chapter provides a brief overview and historical perspective of human factors and how human factors can be applied to surgery, specifically focusing on attention, mental workload, situation awareness, and stress.

AB  - Accuracy in assessing academic achievement and potential is a core component of teachers’ diagnostic competence. Large-scale studies in the Luxembourgish and German educational systems show that teachers’ secondary school track decisions are biased by a student’s social background. Therefore, biased assessment of students may contribute to the social inequalities observed in secondary schools in both countries. Within a social cognitive framework of dual-process theories, bias is explained by heuristic information processing, which, in contrast to information-integrating processing, relies on stereotype-based expectations to form judgments about students. A series of experimental studies investigated the information processing strategies of teachers, identifying a low accountability of the decision setting and a high consistency of student information as key moderators that promote stereotype-based information processing strategies in teachers’ school track decisions. Results on intervention modules gave insights how to increase diagnostic competence in teacher education programs.

AB  - This study explored the abilities of 5th, 8th, and 10th graders, and College students to reason logically about what they read. Both students’ metacognitive behavior (looking back at previously read text) and their performance on logical deduction questions were recorded and analyzed in a reading task. Conditional logic premises and deductive questions were embedded in three narratives containing premise information that was factual (True Story), contrary to fact (False Story), or unverifiable via common world knowledge (Neutral Story). The texts and questions were presented one sentence at a time on a computer screen; participants controlled the presentation of sentences. For answering the questions, three response tasks were devised. One task (labeled Generate) required readers to generate their own logical conclusions in response to deduction questions. Two tasks (labeled Valid and Invalid) required readers to evaluate logically valid or logically invalid conclusions drawn by story characters in the texts. Students in early and late adolescence looked back more when asked to evaluate logical conclusions than when asked to generate conclusions on their own; College students’ lookback frequencies were not significantly affected by response task, but were greater overall than those of younger students. With conditional forms requiring an uncertainty response (Affirmed Consequent and Denied Antecedent), readers looked back more when evaluating logically invalid conclusions than when evaluating logically valid ones. Readers of all ages were more likely to agree with story characters’ (valid) uncertain conclusions with the AC and DA forms than they were to disagree with story characters’ (invalid) certain conclusions to these forms. Both lookback frequency and performance on logic questions were lowest when readers were required to reason from contrary to fact premises.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Breznitz (J Educ Psychol 89:289–297, 1987a; Fluency in reading: synchronization of processes. Erlbaum, Mahwah, 2006) demonstrated that a fading manipulation, which continuously erases text based on the individual reading rate, results in improved reading performance. Several studies using this fading procedure showed that children as well as adults with different reading proficiency levels and in different languages were able to increase their reading rate and reading comprehension in a fading condition, characterizing the Acceleration Phenomenon. Considering the close interconnection of reading fluency and reading comprehension, a fact retrieval account for achievement enhancements induced by the fading manipulation is presented in this chapter. It is hypothesized, that if information can be processed at a high level of automaticity and available lexical entries can be accessed rapidly, reading performance can be improved by means of imposing a time limitation. Hence, the nature of the fading manipulation may induce a shift to faster and more elaborated strategies, such as direct fact retrieval, resulting in improved performance. Different empirical outcomes from the reading and the arithmetic domain are demonstrated and the generalizability of the Acceleration Phenomenon across academic domains is discussed.

AB  - Artificial intelligence can be defined as computer systems which have been designed to interact with the world through abilities (e.g. visual perception and speech recognition) and intelligent behaviours (e.g. evaluating the available information and then taking the most sensible action to achieve a defined aim) that we would think of as principally humans. Initially, research has focused on letting software do things better, in which computers have always been doing better, such as the analysis of large datasets. However, the use of artificial intelligence in our day-to-day life has increased exponentially. Data forms the basis for the development of artificial intelligent software systems that will not only collect information but is able to learn, understand and interpret information, adapt its behaviour, plan, conclude, solve problems, think abstract, come up with ideas and understand and interpret language. Thanks to AI, a smart phone can detect cancer and a smart watch can detect a stroke. Machine learning is infiltrating and optimizing nearly every aspect of medicine from the way 911 emergency services are dispatched to assisting doctors during surgery. People can even quit smoking or kick opiate addiction with the help of AI. AI scientists are currently developing new approaches in machine learning, computer modelling and probability statistics to improve decision-making processes and are using decision theory and neuroscience to drive the progress of more effective healthcare and education as well as economics. This chapter will discuss the science of AI and explore the importance of big data and AI strategies. It will expand to discuss AI and medicine as well as medical education. It will conclude with discussion of AI and education as well as the future of artificial intelligence.

VL  - 27
IS  - 2
AB  - The general foundations for a theory of human sentence processing and the basic goals and questions of the 1960s are argued to be solid and still very relevant today, even if the particular processing model of the time (the clausal model) does not hold up. Today there is considerable agreement that sentence processing is both fast and grammatically controlled from the outset, and that minimal structure and recent attachments are favored across a diverse range of languages. Parsing is not purely bottom-up but instead allows phrases to be postulated before all daughters have been parsed; it works similarly for head-initial and head-final languages. The parser takes as input a rich prosodic/intonational representation which influences processing in ways that extend far beyond use of intonational boundaries as local (juncture) cues. It is argued that psycholinguistic evidence disconfirms the use of prepackaged fully articulated X′ templates for identifying phrase structure, instead supporting the extended projections of Grimshaw (1991). Further, considerable evidence shows that the processor respects grammatical distinctions among types of dependencies, as indicated by differential processing effects for antecedent-government chains versus binding relations, by the processing difficulty of composite dependencies involving more than one grammatical type of dependency, and by distinctions between deep and surface anaphora. The central problem for future theories of sentence processing is claimed to be the development of theories of sentence interpretation. Various possible approaches are discussed, including parallel computation of alternatives with subsequent selection, a task-driven interpretive system, and underspecification. The question is raised whether sentence-level psycholinguistics is in the middle of a paradigm shift from models with symbolic representations and an intrinsically serial (Von Neumann) architecture to constraint-satisfaction/connectionist models with inherently parallel architectures. Reasons are offered for rejecting current constraint-satisfaction models, including lack of supporting evidence discriminating between constraint-satisfaction and “conventional” models, serious problems with the use of prepackaged X′ templates for identifying phrase structure (the only proposal to date for handling syntactic structures in constraint-based models) and an inability to deal with cross-language generalizations. Pure connectionist models are unlikely to fare better in the future for two reasons. They are apparently unable to handle restricted universal quantification (Marcus, 1998)which clearly lies within the capacity of the human sentence processor. Further, competition between alternatives lies at the very heart of such models. Maximal competition should occur in processing fully ambiguous sentences and thus they are predicted to take longer to process than biased or temporarily ambiguous ones (Frazier & Clifton, 1997). But the empirical evidence suggests that fully ambiguous sentences are not systematically harder to process than their disambiguated counterparts.

SP  - 347
EP  - 376
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Pain by its evolutionary nature demands attention, warrants interpretation, and often etches itself into our lifelong memories. These cognitive processes of attending, interpreting, and remembering are central components of the pain experience and guide our approach and avoidance of future pain-related experiences. In this chapter, we discuss how cognitive processes influence and are influenced by our experience of pain, and the role of caregivers in the development and malleability of pain-related cognition. We focus on the parent–child relationship, as this is where most research has been conducted. We present evidence suggesting that the experience of chronic pain, or maladaptive pain behaviors, is often associated with distortions in cognitive processes—known as cognitive biases. Biases in attention, interpretation, and memory may help maintain pain over time, and contribute to distress and disability. Evidence for the influence of parents in children’s pain memory development is growing. However, little research has investigated the role of parents and caregivers in attention and interpretation biases specifically. Here, we draw from research in anxiety disorders and depression indicating that caregivers may play a role in triggering, strengthening, and reducing threat-related cognitive biases. Indeed, threat-related cognitive biases appear to pass down through generations. Experimental studies in particular reveal that these biases can be influenced by parents’ verbal information, emotion, and behaviors, indicating potential mechanisms for this intergenerational transmission of cognitive bias. We suggest ways in which we can draw from these studies in anxiety and depression to design novel studies for understanding the role of caregivers in the experience of pain-related cognition. Targeting pain-related cognitive biases in caregivers and patients may provide novel therapeutic targets for individuals suffering from pain.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose a datamining based method for automated reverse engineering of search strategies during active visual search tasks. The method uses a genetic program (GP) that evolves populations of fuzzy decision trees and selects an optimal one. Previous psychophysical observations of subjects engaged in a simple search task result in a database of stimulus conditions and concomitant measures of eye gaze information and associated psychophysical metrics that globally describe the subjects search strategies. Fuzzy rules about the likely design properties of the components of the visual system involved in selecting fixation location during search are defined based on these metrics. A fitness function that incorporates both the fuzzy rules and the information in the database is used to conduct GP based datamining. The information extracted through the GP process is the internal design specification of the visual system vis-à-vis active visual search.

SP  - 369
EP  - 382
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - User interaction logging is a powerful tool for user behavior studies, usability testing, and system metrics analysis. It may also be applied in large data contexts, such as social networks analysis, helping data scientists to understand social patterns. Data scientists, User Experience (UX) designers, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners, and software engineers have been performing the analysis of this kind of data to obtain knowledge regarding the source system’s usage. User interaction log data, however, can also be critical for final users themselves. They can use interaction log data, for example, (i) to revisit his own interaction path, redoing his steps that lead to a relevant insight or discovery; (ii) to learn from someone else’s interaction path new ways to perform a given task; (iii) or even to analyze critical steps of a process supported by the source system. The need for final users to consume interaction log data is presenting significant challenges for UX researchers. Influenced by Semiotic Engineering, a HCI theory that views human-computer interaction as a form of human communication between designers and users mediated by a computer system, we propose three user interaction log abstraction levels - strategic, tactical, and operational - to frame and guide user interaction logs’ UX design. In this paper, we discuss how those abstraction levels can be used as UX design guidelines and present some research questions to be explored - how source system captures interaction log is central for log analysis strategy and how a strategic level can be identified thought the analysis of interaction logs data from other abstraction levels.

TI  - Search. Review. Repeat? An empirical study of threats to replicating SLR searches
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
AB  - A systematic literature review (SLR) is an empirical method used to provide an overview of existing knowledge and to aggregate evidence within a domain. For computer science, several threats to the completeness of such reviews have been identified, leading to recommendations and guidelines on how to improve their quality. However, few studies address to what extent researchers can replicate an SLR. To conduct a replication, researchers have to first understand how the set of primary studies has been identified in the original study, and can ideally retrieve the same set when following the reported protocol. In this article, we focus on this initial step of a replication and report a two-fold empirical study: Initially, we performed a tertiary study using a sample of SLRs in computer science and identified what information that is needed to replicate the searches is reported. Based on the results, we conducted a descriptive, multi-case study on digital libraries to investigate to what extent these allow replications. The results reveal two threats to replications of SLRs: First, while researchers have improved the quality of their reports, relevant details are still missing—we refer to a reporting threat. Second, we found that some digital libraries are inconsistent in their query results—we refer to a searching threat. While researchers conducting a review can only overcome the first threat and the second may not be an issue for all kinds of replications, researchers should be aware of both threats when conducting, reviewing, and building on SLRs.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Existing capability models lack qualitative and quantitative means to compare business capabilities. This paper extends previous work and uses affordance theories to consistently model and analyse capabilities. We use the concept of objective and subjective affordances to model capability as a tuple of a set of resource affordance system mechanisms and action paths, dependent on one or more critical affordance factors. We identify an affordance chain of subjective affordances by which affordances work together to enable an action and an affordance path that links action affordances to create a capability system. We define the mechanism and path underlying capability. We show how affordance modelling notation, AMN, can represent affordances comprising a capability. We propose a method to quantitatively and qualitatively compare capabilities using efficiency, effectiveness and quality metrics. The method is demonstrated by a medical example comparing the capability of syringe and needless anaesthetic systems.

AB  - This review article provides reflections on the state of the art of research in conjoint analysis—where we came from, where we are, and some directions as to where we might go. We review key articles, mostly contemporary published since 2000, but some classic, drawn from the major marketing as well as various interdisciplinary academic journals to highlight important areas related to conjoint analysis research and identify more recent developments in this area. We develop an organizing framework that attempts to integrate various threads of research in conjoint methods and models. Our goal is to (a) emphasize the major developments in recent years, (b) evaluate these developments, and (c) to identify several potential directions for future research.

JO  - European archives of psychiatry and neurological sciences
SP  - 23
EP  - 26
VL  - 239
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper attempts to distinguish between inattention and inefficiency as the cause of the eye movement problems of schizophrenic subjects. It focuses on their release of fast saccadic eye movements in four different situations: interrupting smooth tracking, as double-jumps in refixation, and as inadvertent departures from steady fixation or too-early prediction moves. If an attention deficit causes saccades during tracking, they should be reduced only for schizophrenic subjects in the dark, when there is no constrasting background. Instead the reduction was present for all groups. If double-jumps in saccadic refixations were caused by inattentional instability, they should increase in schizophrenic subjects when the target is a temporary flash of light. Instead, they were reduced in all groups to almost none, suggesting a perceptual processing cause for the excess double jumps. If a global attentional problem of schizophrenia caused saccade release, saccade number should be correlated across the four situations. Instead, there were significant correlations only between departures and predictions in paranoid schizophrenic subjects (r = 0.728) and between predictions and looking in nonparanoid schizophrenic subjects (r = −0.855). This lack of over-all correlations suggests that a common inattentional problem does not produce these eye movement deficiencies. Instead, the perceptual influence on tracking and looking suggests that processing inefficiency is responsible for at least part of the deficit.

AB  - Wayfinding models can be helpful in describing, understanding, and technologically supporting the processes involved in navigation. However, current models either lack a high degree of formalization, or they are not holistic and perceptually grounded, which impedes their use for cognitive engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel formalism that covers the core wayfinding processes, yet is modular in nature by allowing for open slots for those spatial cognitive processes that are modifiable, or not yet well understood. Our model is based on a formal grammar grounded in spatial reference systems and is both interpretable in terms of observable behavior and executable to allow for empirical testing as well as the simulation of wayfinding.

JO  - Educational Psychology Review

EP  - 741
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
AB  - Generative learning involves actively making sense of to-be-learned information by mentally reorganizing and integrating it with one’s prior knowledge, thereby enabling learners to apply what they have learned to new situations. In this article, we present eight learning strategies intended to promote generative learning: summarizing, mapping, drawing, imagining, self-testing, self-explaining, teaching, and enacting. First, we provide an overview of generative learning theory, grounded in Wittrock’s (1974) generative model of comprehension and reflected in more recent frameworks of active learning, such as Mayer’s (2014) select-organize-integrate (SOI) framework. Next, for each of the eight generative learning strategies, we provide a description, review exemplary research studies, discuss potential boundary conditions, and provide practical recommendations for implementation. Finally, we discuss the implications of generative learning for the science of learning, and we suggest directions for further research.

TI  - Reanalysis and Limited Repair Parsing: Leaping off the Garden Path
BT  - Reanalysis in Sentence Processing
SP  - 247
EP  - 285
PB  - Springer Netherlands
CY  - Dordrecht
AB  - This chapter develops a theory of reanalysis called limited repair parsing. Repair parsers deal with the problem of local ambiguity in part by modifying previously built structure when the chosen structure later proves to be inconsistent. This modification of existing structure distinguishes repair parsing from parallel or multi-path parsing, least-commitment parsing, backtracking, or reparsing strategies. Parsers with a limited capability for repair are psycholinguistically important because they can potentially explain the contrasts between difficult garden path structures (when repair fails) and unproblematic local ambiguities (when repair is successful or easy). Although the idea of repair has been implicit in some psycholinguistic work (and emerged explicitly in the diagnosis model of Fodor & Inoue, 1994, and the NL-Soar model of Lewis, 1993), there has been no clear formulation of the general class of repair parsers. This chapter makes a first step toward such a formulation, shows how repair parsing offers significant computational advantages over other alternatives for reanalysis, and proposes a particular repair mechanism, snip, that explains a wide range of cross-linguistic reanalysis phenomena. Snip is a proposal for a simple, automatic, on-line repair process. The chapter concludes by briefly describing how snip can be embedded in a more comprehensive sentence processing architecture that maintains the structural sensitivity of purely syntactic theories like Pritchett’s (1992), yet still accounts for the flexibility of parsing as revealed by interactive studies.

BT  - Organizational Neuroethics: Reflections on the Contributions of Neuroscience to Management Theories and Business Practices
SP  - 109
EP  - 130
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Recent advances in decision neuroscience hold promise to address questions that have engaged organizational ethics scholars for decades. Following from this promise, two research questions emerge: (1) What are the most productive ways to enhance organizational ethics through scholarly communication and collaborative work among philosophers, social scientists, and neuroscientists? (2) What contributions have already been made, and how can we build on those contributions? Specifically, how can scholars in the field of organizational ethics, both normative and empirical scholars, shape future neuroscience research on topics germane to their research interests? Decision neuroscience confirms that people do not make ethical decisions in a strictly rational manner but that emotion and intuition play important roles. The challenge is to link neuroscience findings such as these to questions specific to empirical organizational ethics research, as well as to higher-order normative questions. Research on moral cognition is emphasized, including conceptualizations of moral cognition, brain structure and function, and dual process theory and the role of emotion. Future research suggestions are included.

TI  - Leveraging analytics to produce compelling and profitable film content
JO  - Journal of Cultural Economics
AB  - Producing compelling film content profitably is a top priority to the long-term prosperity of the film industry. Advances in digital technologies, increasing availabilities of granular big data, rapid diffusion of analytic techniques, and intensified competition from user-generated content and original content produced by subscription video on demand platforms have created unparalleled needs and opportunities for film producers to leverage analytics in content production. Built upon the theories of value creation and film production, this article proposes a conceptual framework of key analytic techniques that film producers may engage throughout the production process, such as script analytics, talent analytics, and audience analytics. The article further synthesizes the state-of-the-art research on and applications of these analytics, discuss the prospect of leveraging analytics in film production, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research with important managerial implications.

JO  - Behavior Research Methods
SP  - 1004
EP  - 1011
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
AB  - Verb bias, or the tendency of a verb to appear with a certain type of complement, has been employed in psycholinguistic literature as a tool to test competing models of sentence processing. To date, the vast majority of sentence processing research involving verb bias has been conducted almost exclusively with monolingual speakers, and predominantly with monolingual English speakers, despite the fact that most of the world’s population is bilingual. To test the generality of competing theories of sentence comprehension, it is important to conduct cross-linguistic studies of sentence processing and to add bilingual data to theories of sentence comprehension. Given this, it is critical for the field to develop verb bias estimates from monolingual speakers of languages other than English and from bilingual populations. We begin to address these issues in two norming studies. Study 1 provides verb bias norming data for 135 Spanish verbs. A second aim of Study 1 was to determine whether verb bias estimates remain stable over time. In Study 2, we asked whether Spanish—English speakers are able to learn verb-specific information, such as verb bias, in their second language. The answer to this question is critical to conducting studies that examine when, during the course of sentence comprehension, bilingual speakers exploit verb information specific to the second language. To facilitate cross-linguistic work, we compared our verb bias results with those provided by monolingual English speakers in a previous norming study conducted by Garnsey, Lotocky, Pearlmutter, and Myers (1997). Our Spanish data demonstrated that individual verbs showed significant similarities in their verb bias across the 3 years of data collection. We also show that bilinguals are able to learn the biases of verbs in their second language, even when immersed in the first language environment. Appendixes A–C, containing the bilingual norms discussed in the article, may be downloaded from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental.

JO  - Motivation and Emotion
SP  - 64
EP  - 78
VL  - 42
IS  - 1
AB  - Research and theory suggest that anxious people employ cognitive control on a relatively late and transient basis. This tendency may impair emotion regulation that depends on early, persistent implementation of cognitive control. We examined whether anxious people could be trained to apply cognitive control proactively (i.e., in advance of goal-related action) and whether such training limited anxiety’s rise during stress. In Study 1, 96 high trait-anxious participants completed proactive or reactive training followed by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) with measurement of subjective anxiety, heart rate, and skin conductance level (SCL). In Study 2, 59 high trait-anxious participants completed a proactive or no-instruction training for 4 days and then completed the TSST. For Study 2 but not Study 1, the proactive versus control training was associated with lower stress-related increases in subjective anxiety and heart rate, but not sympathetically mediated SCL. Exercising proactive control may leverage the parasympathetic nervous system to inhibit the escalation of anxious arousal during stress.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 191

VL  - 36
IS  - 3
AB  - Four experiments were performed which had the goal of determining how and when young children acquire the ability to understand long distance dependencies. These studies examined the operations underlying the auditory processing of non-canonically ordered constituents in object-relative sentences. Children 4–6 years of age and an adult population participated in the study, which employed a cross modal picture priming methodology to determine when constituents in a non-canonical position are reactivated during ongoing sentence comprehension. The results support the view that even very young children have the same structural processing reflex seen in adults. Namely, children re-activate a non-canonically positioned (fronted) direct object NP immediately at the post-verb gap site during sentence processing.

Any disruption to workflow can result in severe, adverse consequences such as decreased time efficiency and greater patient safety risks. In the recent two decades, the most systemic disruption to clinical workflow across the globe is associated with the widespread implementation of health IT systems, electronic health records (EHR) in particular.

JO  - Journal of Cultural Cognitive Science
SP  - 113
EP  - 139
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - Over the last 25 years, the visual world paradigm has enabled discoveries and theoretical advances in spoken language processing. However, the intuitive interpretation of fixations in the visual world paradigm—that fixations directly reflect over-time processes of activation and competition governing cognitive and language processing—deserves scrutiny. This paper provides a selective review of studies that suggest that the relations between fixations and ongoing processing are more complex than suggested by the intuitive interpretation. A particular challenge is explaining why context sometimes appears to have deep effects on language processing, while other times fixations appear to violate strong contextual constraints. I discuss implications of these seemingly contradictory patterns for theories of real-world language processing, and practical implications for using the visual world paradigm. Along the way, I review four possible linking hypotheses for connecting measures in the paradigm to theories of language and cognition. This review leads to the conclusion that implemented computational models will be needed to assess to what degree different linking hypotheses generate distinguishable predictions.

AB  - While educational science in the past mainly focused on students’ formal or intentional learning from courses, textbooks, or online tutorials in university contexts, communication science usually deals with ordinary citizens’ informal or unintentional learning from the mass media in everyday life. One of the general aims of the PLATO project is to bring these research traditions together. Therefore, this paper sums up research on media effects on positive and negative learning recently conducted; our studies show that media coverage is often biased and news media, therefore, contribute to negative as well as positive learning. Which kind of learning occurs, heavily depends on the way information is presented.

AB  - To account for natural variability in cognitive processing, it is standard practice to optimize a model’s parameters by fitting it to behavioral data. Although most language-related theories acknowledge a large role for experience in language processing, variability reflecting that knowledge is usually ignored when evaluating a model’s fit to representative data. We fit language-based behavioral data using experiential optimization, a method that optimizes the materials that a model is given while retaining the learning and processing mechanisms of standard practice. Rather than using default materials, experiential optimization selects the optimal linguistic sources to create a memory representation that maximizes task performance. We demonstrate performance on multiple benchmark tasks by optimizing the experience on which a model’s representation is based.

AB  - While research on the effects of technological distractions on doctoring may be relatively new, research on the effect of technological distractions on driving is not. The purpose of this chapter is to translate what we know from traffic safety into medical safety. Both have one very important aspect in common: the human brain. This chapter will provide a simple framework for understanding the cognitive processes that are affected by distraction. It will make a convincing case that the research consistently shows sharing attention between two seemingly simple tasks can have a deadly impact on performing one of them. A case will be made that this problem will continue to grow. The chapter will briefly explore the reasons we convince ourselves that we can do two things at once. And in conclusion, the chapter will offer some suggestions for solving the problem.

AB  - Over the last decades, CSCW research has undergone significant structural changes and has grown steadily with manifested differences from other fields in terms of theory building, methodology, and socio-technicality. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the scientific literature for mapping the intellectual structure of CSCW research and its scientific development over a 15-year period (2001–2015). A total of 1713 publications were subjected to examination in order to draw statistics and depict dynamic changes to shed new light upon the growth, spread, and collaboration of CSCW devoted outlets. Overall, our study characterizes top (cited and downloaded) papers, citation patterns, prominent authors and institutions, demographics, collaboration patterns, most frequent topic clusters and keywords, and social mentions by country, discipline, and professional status. The results highlight some areas of improvement for the field and a lot of well-established topics which are changing gradually with impact on citations and downloads. Statistical models reveal that the field is predominantly influenced by fundamental and highly recognized scientists and papers. A small number of papers without citations, the growth of the number of papers by year, and an average number of more than 39 citations per paper in all venues ensure the field a healthy and evolving nature. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the influence of CSCW on the larger field of HCI.

BT  - International Handbook of Metacognition and Learning Technologies
SP  - 629
EP  - 644
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Models of self-regulated learning (SRL) describe the complex and dynamic interplay of learners’ cognitions, motivations, and behaviors when engaged in a learning activity. Recently, researchers have begun to use fine-grained behavioral data such as think aloud protocols and log-file data from educational software to test hypotheses regarding the cognitive and metacognitive processes underlying SRL. Motivational states, however, have been more difficult to trace through these methods and have primarily been studied via pre- and posttest questionnaires. This is problematic because motivation can change during an activity or unit and without fine-grained assessment, dynamic relations between motivation, cognitive, and metacognitive processes cannot be studied. In this chapter we describe a method for collecting fine-grained assessments of motivational variables and examine their association with cognitive and metacognitive behaviors for students learning mathematics with intelligent tutoring systems. Students completed questionnaires embedded in the tutoring software before and after a math course and at multiple time points during the course. We describe the utility of this method for assessing motivation and use these assessments to test hypotheses of self-regulated learning and motivation. Learners’ reports of their motivation varied across domain and unit-level assessments and were differently predictive of learning behaviors.

VL  - 62
IS  - 5
AB  - Hypermedia learning environments (HLE) unevenly present new challenges and opportunities to learning processes and outcomes depending on learner characteristics and instructional supports. In this experimental study, we examined how one such HLE—MetaTutor, an intelligent, multi-agent tutoring system designed to scaffold cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning (SRL) processes—interacts with learner’s prior domain knowledge to affect their note-taking activities and subsequent learning outcomes. Sixty (N = 60) college students studied with MetaTutor for 120 min and took notes on hypermedia content of the human circulatory system. Log-files and screen recordings of learner-system interactions were used to analyze notes for several quantitative and qualitative variables. Results show that most note-taking was a verbatim copy of instructional content, which negatively related to the post-test measure of learning. There was an interaction between prior knowledge and pedagogical agent scaffolding, such that low prior knowledge students took a greater quantity of notes compared to their high prior knowledge counterparts, but only in the absence of MetaTutor SRL scaffolding; when agent SRL scaffolding was present, the note-taking activities of low prior knowledge students were statistically equivalent to the number of notes taken by their high prior knowledge counterparts. Theoretical and instructional design implications are discussed.

AB  - Traditionally, the concept of salience has been mainly employed in the field of social psychology, that branch of psychology that concentrates on the aspects of human behavior which involve individuals and their relationships to other individuals, groups, social institutions and to society as a whole. In this literature, the origin of the term (saliency) dates back to Krech and Crutchfield (1948),1 although similar concepts had been developed since the end of the 19th century under different names (see, e.g., Calkins 1894, 1896; von Restorff 1933). Only recently, however, has this concept found its current form with the studies of Taylor and Fiske in the field of person perception (Taylor and Fiske 1975, 1978; Fiske and Taylor 1984, 1991). While they referred to social stimuli: (persons and their attributes), in past research the stimulus has been variously represented, from concrete objects to abstract entities (such as attitudes, values interests, behaviors).

Nevertheless these methods where usually designed to fit engineer-to-cost strategies for cost efficient products. Recent success stories of companies in different industrial sectors have proven, that engineer-to-value strategies can lead to an even higher profitability of products due to higher margins when combining value and cost orientation (ISO/IEC: 15288:2008; Schuh 2012).

JO  - Educational Psychology Review
SP  - 339
EP  - 359
VL  - 31
IS  - 2
AB  - We discuss four ways in which emotion may relate to cognitive load during learning. One perspective describes emotions as extraneous cognitive load, competing for the limited resources of working memory by requiring the processing of task-extra or task-irrelevant information. Another perspective shows that encoding, storage, and retrieval of information are affected by emotion even before awareness of the material, and that emotion may directly affect memory by broadening or narrowing cognitive resources, and by mechanisms such as mood-dependent and mood-congruent processing. A third perspective describes how emotion may affect intrinsic cognitive load, such as when emotion regulation is part of the learning outcomes. We also discuss a dual-channel assumption for emotions. A final perspective is that emotion affects motivation, and, in turn, mental effort investment. These four ways of considering emotion as part of CLT are best understood when taking an interval view of cognitive load.

Therefore, people devoted all aspects from the terminal, network and software platforms to make unremitting efforts. Under this basis, we conduct synthetic research on the data encryption based mobile computing security enhancement model and multi-channel mobile human computer interaction framework in this paper. We firstly introduce the discrete-time Hopfield neural network based data encryption algorithm beyond the analysis on the information flow security and type based model, data security review and attack model under mobile computing environment. We improve learning algorithm of the MD method to avoid the sample mobile and cross interference problems of Hebb rule. Later, we integrate the multi-channel concept to propose the new multi-channel man–machine interaction. In our framework, the 3D interactive technology, speech recognition and synthesis technology, natural language understanding and processing technology, eye tracking technology, posture, input, tactile, force display basic technology are taken into consideration for the synthetic analysis. The result from the experimental simulation proves that our methodology obtains better effectiveness and feasibility from both the angels of data security and interface experience.

AB  - Our research aims to identify domain-specific similarities and differences of externalized cognitive structures. Cognitive structure, also known as knowledge structure or structural knowledge, is conceived as the manner in which an individual organizes the relationships of concepts in memory. By diagnosing these structures precisely, even partially, the educator comes closer to influencing them through instructional settings and materials. Our assessment and analysis of cognitive structures is realized within the HIMATT tool, which automatically generates four quantitative indicators for the structural entities of written text or causal maps. In our study, participants worked on the subject domains biology, history, and mathematics. Results clearly indicate different structural and semantic features across the three subject domains. Additionally, we found that written texts and causal maps seem to represent different structure and content across the three subject domains when compared to an expert’s representation. We conclude with a general discussion, instructional implications and suggestions for future research.

Focusing on capture and re-enactment of human expertise, this work looks at the unique affordances of suitable hard- and software technologies. The practical challenges of interpreting expertise, using suitable sensors for its capture and specifying the means to describe and display to the novice are of central significance here. We link affordances with hardware devices, discussing their alternatives, including Microsoft Hololens, Thalmic Labs MYO, Alex Posture sensor, MyndPlay EEG headband, and a heart rate sensor. Following the selection of sensors, we describe integration and communication requirements for the prototype. We close with thoughts on the wider possibilities for implementation and next steps.

AB  - In order to manage increasing complexity so called cognitive assistance systems are integrated into assembly systems. On the basis of real-time measurement and analysis of physiological signals, these assistance systems help to coordinate efficient behavior and to prevent states of long lasting detrimental workload and strain. With measurement technology getting smaller, more powerful and wearable it’s possible to collect and analyze personal physiological data in real-time and detect significant changes at the workplace. It is intended to use these data to control a cognitive assistance systems which as a consequence of a monitored detrimental workload leads to adaptive changes in assembly processes and to a reduction of workload. The underlying principle can be a self-actualizing machine learning algorithm. We want to present a theoretical framework to sketch possibilities of such data-controlled, adaptive systems and to describe some obstacles which have to be overcome before they’re ready for use.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct communication channel between human brain and output devices. Due to advantages such as non-invasiveness, ease of use, and low cost, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular method for current BCIs. This chapter gives an overview of the current EEG-based BCIs for the main purpose of communication and control. This chapter first provides a taxonomy of the EEG-based BCI systems by categorizing them into three major groups: (1) BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERPs), (2) BCIs based on sensorimotor rhythms, and (3) hybrid BCIs.

TI  - The role of emotion regulation in socially anxious children and adolescents: a systematic review
JO  - European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
AB  - While numerous studies suggest that emotion dysregulation is important in maintaining social anxiety among adults, the role of emotion regulation in children and adolescents with social anxiety is not yet well understood. In this systematic review, we use the process model of emotion regulation as a framework for understanding emotion regulation in children and adolescents with social anxiety. We performed a systematic literature search in the electronic data bases Medline and PsycINFO. Additional studies were identified by hand search. We identified 683 studies, screened their titles and abstracts, viewed 142 studies, and included 55 of these. Study results indicate that children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder or high social anxiety show emotion dysregulation across all five domains of emotion regulation, such as enhanced social avoidance, more safety behaviors, repetitive negative thinking, biased attention and interpretation of social information, and reduced emotional expression. While enhanced social avoidance seems to be specific to childhood social anxiety, other maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as repetitive negative thinking, seem to occur transdiagnostically across different childhood anxiety disorders. Implications for current theory, interventions and future research are discussed.

AB  - Perception and attention mechanisms are of great importance for entities situated within complex dynamic environments. With roles extending greatly beyond passive information services about the external environment, such mechanisms actively prioritise, augment and expedite information to ensure that the potentially relevant is made available so appropriate action can take place. Here, we describe the rationale behind endowing artificial entities, or virtual agents, with real-time perception and attention systems. We cover the fundamentals of designing and building such systems. Once equipped, the resulting agents can achieve a more substantial connection with their environment for the purposes of reacting, planning, decision making and, ultimately, behaving.

AB  - Laparoscopic surgery is a recent common surgical technique as one of minimally invasive surgery. This surgery is performed under the situation, such as the limited field of view egocentric video from a laparoscope, and poor force sensation from surgical instruments. Especially, the techniques called “Eye-hand coordination”, which represents the collaboration of gazing action and hand action (instrument manipulation), is very important technique in the surgery. In this paper, we analyze gazing actions and instruments manipulation for evaluating the “Eye-hand coordination” technique in order to support the training of Laparoscopic surgery.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - A magnitude of predominantly qualitative empirical and conceptual work has indentified design principles that provide for the design of creativity support systems (CSS). Numerous kernel theories have been utilized to inform CSS design principles. However, the logical next step for design research is pending: this rich field of research may now allow for more quantitative empirical research on the actual effects of particular CSS design features on creative performance. Against the background of this research gap, we first analyze existing CSS design theories applying an analysis framework encompassing obligatory design theory components. On that basis, we extract the underlying independent (latent) variables addressed in design principles. Our contribution entails a unified design theory for CSS, laying the basis for future research in IS design science on creativity-support. Furthermore, we reflect on our approach to develop a unified design theory and discuss its implications for the philosophy of design science.

TI  - Let’s Open the Decision-Making Umbrella: A Framework for Conceptualizing and Assessing Features of Impaired Decision Making in Addiction
JO  - Neuropsychology Review
SP  - 27
EP  - 51
VL  - 29
IS  - 1
AB  - Decision-making impairments play a pivotal role in the emergence and maintenance of addictive disorders. However, a sound conceptualization of decision making as an umbrella construct, encompassing its cognitive, affective, motivational, and physiological subcomponents, is still lacking. This prevents an efficient evaluation of the heterogeneity of decision-making impairments and the development of tailored treatment. This paper thus unfolds the various processes involved in decision making by adopting a critical approach of prominent dual- or triadic-process models, which postulate that decision making is influenced by the interplay of impulsive-automatic, reflective-controlled, and interoceptive processes. Our approach also focuses on social cognition processes, which play a crucial role in decision making and addictive disorders but were largely ignored in previous dual- or triadic-process models. We propose here a theoretical framework in which a range of coordinated processes are first identified on the basis of their theoretical and clinical relevance. Each selected process is then defined before reviewing available results underlining its role in addictive disorders (i.e., substance use, gambling, and gaming disorders). Laboratory tasks for measuring each process are also proposed, initiating a preliminary process-based decision-making assessment battery. This original approach may offer an especially informative view of the constitutive features of decision-making impairments in addiction. As prior research has implicated these features as risk factors for the development and maintenance of addictive disorders, our processual approach sets the scene for novel and transdiagnostic experimental and applied research avenues.

EP  - 1167
VL  - 42
IS  - 6
AB  - Data-driven modeling approaches receive significant attention in robotics as they are capable of representing system behavior to which first-order principles cannot be employed. Modeling of human motions, based on observations is one of the many application areas. So far, however, the available probabilistic approaches cannot handle dynamics evolving in the space of rigid motions, as rotations are not appropriately considered. In this article, we present a mathematical framework for Gaussian process modeling, where the valid input domain is generalized to full rigid motions, namely the special Euclidean group SE(3). The kernel functions inside the Gaussian process are modified to exploit properties of the input data representation by dual quaternions. We further prove that the presented covariance functions maintain the Gaussian process properties. The correctness and accuracy of our approach is validated on simulated and real human motion data. We analyze the estimation performance of the novel Gaussian process framework in comparison to state of the art techniques, and show significantly improved model behavior of rigid motions.

AB  - The development of augmented reality glasses is still ongoing and faces barriers in diffusion and concerns about their impact on users, organizations and society. The study aims to find sufficient solutions for this struggling digital innovation and to provide guidance for the implementation of augmented reality glasses in design-oriented projects. During a 3-year consortium research, acceptance and privacy have been identified as major phenomena that influence the adoption of augmented reality glasses in the logistics domain. To forge ahead digital innovation research, the focus of the presented research lies on the diffusion of this technology with design knowledge for the development of augmented reality glasses-based systems. Evidence and artifacts contribute to the still limited knowledge of system design based on augmented reality glasses from a domain-specific instantiation and an implementation framework.

AB  - New challenges such as big data, ultra-large-scale services, and continuously available services are driving the evolution to adaptive software systems, which are able to modify their behavior in response to their environmental and internal changes, in order to achieve their goals. Providing support in all phases of the life cycle of adaptive software systems is thus an important challenge facing the software engineering research community. This chapter highlights current research on methods and techniques for the design and engineering of adaptive software systems. The design space for self-adaptive systems is first examined, and then a goal-oriented framework for adaptive service composition is described. The human factors component of the design of adaptive systems are considered from four different points of view. We then argue that model management from database community can be adapted for effective development of self-adaptive systems. Finally, sustainability of adaptive components are shown to be achieved by making requirements future-proof.

JO  - Educational Psychology Review
SP  - 293
EP  - 317
VL  - 31
IS  - 2
AB  - Cognitive load theory (CLT) applies what is known about human cognitive architecture to the study of learning and instruction, to generate insights into the characteristics and conditions of effective instruction and learning. Recent developments in CLT suggest that the human motor system plays an important role in cognition and learning; however, it is unclear whether models of working memory (WM) that are typically espoused by CLT researchers can reconcile these novel findings. For instance, often-cited WM models envision separate information processing systems—such as Baddeley and Hitch’s (1974) multicomponent model of WM—as a means to interpret modality-specific findings, although possible interactions with the human motor system remain under-explained. In this article, we examine the viability of these models to theoretically integrate recent research findings regarding the human motor system, as well as their ability to explain established CLT effects and other findings. We argue, it is important to explore alternate models of WM that focus on a single and integrated control of attention system that is applied to visual, phonological, embodied, and other sensory and nonsensory information. An integrated model such as this may better account for individual differences in experience and expertise and, parsimoniously, explain both recent and historical CLT findings across domains. To advance this aim, we propose an integrated model of WM that envisions a common and finite attentional resource that can be distributed across multiple modalities. How attention is mobilized and distributed across domains is interdependent, co-reinforcing, and ever-changing based on learners’ prior experience and their immediate cognitive demands. As a consequence, the distribution of attentional focus and WM resources will vary across individuals and tasks, depending on the nature of the specific task being performed; the neurological, developmental, and experiential abilities of the individual; and the current availability of internal and external cognitive resources.

Anyway, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic analysis and review of the very recent literature according to a marketing framework is still missing. In this work, we intend to provide, first and foremost, a clear understanding of the main concepts and issues regarding social big data, as well as their features and technologies. Secondly, we focus on marketing, describing an operative methodology to get useful insights from social big data. Then, we carry out a brief but accurate classification of recent use cases from the literature, according to the decision support and the competitive advantages obtained by enterprises whenever they exploit the analytics available from social big data sources. Finally, we outline some open issues and suggestions in order to encourage further research in the field.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The unfolding empowerment of instructors as game designers with approachable and widely available tools such as Scratch, Minecraft, or Unreal Engine shifted the perspective on game-based assessment (GBA). An increasing number of instructors are capable of creating games themselves, subsequently gaining access to the mechanics and the embedded data. Thus, detailed information regarding each individual player becomes accessible. This gains importance, as this approach might amplify the availability of desperately needed process data within the fields of instructional psychology and game-based learning research. However, this approach is still in its infancy, and future users and researchers need guidance regarding the gathering and the interpretation of insights created by complex process data within GBA. This becomes particularly important with the increasing use of physiological data in learning as well as assessment scenarios. The ubiquitous availability of sensors acquiring physiological data allows for new and noninvasive ways of acquiring objective real-time data that can provide deeper insights into emotional and cognitive states of players. As the technology becomes less expensive and increasingly novice-friendly, more applications are emerging, ranging from GBA within sport applications to scientific experiments that attempt to connect physiological measures to psychological concepts. This chapter highlights the potentials of process, as well as physiological data, but also the problems that can arise in this context. Finally, this chapter aims to provide a new perspective on the emerging trend of using such data within GBA.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Communication is a key area for early intervention for pre-schoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, there is a need for reliable and valid communication assessment measures for this population. Two commonly used measures are the language scales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Preschool Language Scale—Fifth Edition (PLS—5). To date, limited research has compared these. The aim of the present study was to investigate the similarities and differences in scores on the two instruments for children with ASD and those who were developing typically. The MSEL and the PLS—5 assessments were administered to 49 pre-schoolers including 24 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children. Language scores on the MSEL and PLS—5 were highly correlated within each group. As expected, children with ASD performed significantly lower on both language measures compared to children who were developing typically. Children from both groups performed higher on the PLS—5 than the MSEL on the expressive language scale, and typically developing children also performed higher on the receptive language scale. Limitations and future directions for research in terms of test selection are discussed.

AB  - Our daily lives are supported by various technologies. Generally said, however, older adults cannot benefit from technologies due to difficulties with use of them. As some difficulties seem to be related with the fact that older adults require more time to get used to a new thing, and it is suggested that affectiveness may facilitate of use of technologies, this study tried to clarify the influence of continuous use of portable game system on older adults’ everyday life and emotion. By four-week continuous use of portable game system, some influence of it on older adults’ everyday life and emotion was confirmed. The results suggested the possibility that older adults could utilize technologies which originally aimed at younger users and affectiveness could facilitate it.

JO  - Experimental Brain Research
SP  - 457
EP  - 469
VL  - 212
IS  - 3
AB  - Recent investigations have revealed the kinematics of horizontal saccades are less variable near the end of the trajectory than during the course of execution. Converging evidence indicates that oculomotor networks use online sensorimotor feedback to correct for initial trajectory errors. It is also known that oculomotor networks express saccadic corrections with decreased efficiency when responses are made toward memorized locations. The present research investigated whether repetitive motor timekeeping influences online feedback-based corrections in predictive saccades. Predictive saccades are a subclass of memory-guided saccades and are observed when one makes series of timed saccades. We hypothesized that cueing predictive saccades in a sequence would facilitate the expression of trajectory corrections. Seven participants produced a number of single unpaced, visually guided saccades, and also sequences of timed predictive saccades. Kinematic and trajectory variability were used to measure the expression of online saccadic corrections at a number of time indices in saccade trajectories. In particular, we estimated the minimum time required to implement feedback-based corrections, which was consistently 37 ms. Our observations demonstrate that motor commands in predictive memory-guided saccades can be parameterized by spatial working memory and retain the accuracy of online trajectory corrections typically associated with visually guided behavior. In contrast, untimed memory-guided saccades exhibited diminished kinematic evidence for online corrections. We conclude that motor timekeeping and sequencing contributed to efficient saccadic corrections. These results contribute to an evolving view of the interactions between motor planning and spatial working memory, as they relate to oculomotor control.

JO  - European Journal of Psychology of Education
SP  - 215
EP  - 238
VL  - 29
IS  - 2
AB  - Until recently, museums mainly communicated well-established knowledge. Current science, however, is characterized by a rapid knowledge increase, so that we often have to deal with fragile and inconsistent knowledge. In order to develop exhibitions that encourage visitors to process information in a differentiated way, museums need to know how visitors deal with conflicting information. Furthermore, museum professionals need information on personal and situational factors that may promote the processing of such information. We tested whether conflict processing is influenced by personal characteristics such as situational interest, epistemological beliefs, tolerance of ambiguity, and self-efficacy on the one hand and by situational conditions such as the spatial arrangement of information on the other hand. In two science museums and one museum of cultural history, text pairs were displayed that described a topic from conflicting perspectives. The spatial distance between the two texts was manipulated. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires captured the personal characteristics of 323 visitors and the way they dealt with conflicting information. The results showed that a majority of the visitors perceived a conflict, and a large proportion was willing to process the information at a deeper level. Sophisticated epistemological beliefs, a high tolerance of ambiguity, and high self-efficacy were found to promote situational interest in conflicting information. High situational interest, in turn, promoted a tendency to process deeply. Placing text pairs in close proximity had a positive effect on the processing depth in science museums but not in the museum of cultural history. A possible explanation lies in the higher density of additional and potentially interfering information in the science museums compared to the museum of cultural history.

AB  - As discussed in the previous chapter, we require participants in the market to understand other stakeholders’ contexts and values in the market and to sustain interactions in order to realize their innovations. In other words, communication based on “cognitive empathy” is desired. As in the reference (Thompson 2001), cognitive empathy is not a disembodied and affectless knowing of the other, but rather the feeling of being led by another’s experiences. Here, feeling means the integrated sense of bodily sensation and the emotional feeling of values.

AB  - Wearable computing promises to gain efficiency improvements in industrial applications due to augmentation of the device as well as improved interaction between the user and the device. In this paper, we present the results of a study with focus on utilization of wearable computing in industrial service applications. Our study consisted of a preliminary market scan with regard to wearable computing devices and literature analysis that has been conducted to find out where wearable computing is already used or is well suited for industrial service applications. Additionally, we carried out a case study at an industrial plant to figure out which of the existing service processes can be improved by wearable and mobile devices and show how it could be done. Finally, we discuss the desired developments that would enable wearable computing to enter the practice of industrial service.

BT  - Computer Music Modeling and Retrieval. Sense of Sounds
SP  - 34
EP  - 55
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Many event sequences in everyday human movement exhibit temporal structure: for instance, footsteps in walking, the striking of balls in a tennis match, the movements of a dancer set to rhythmic music, and the gestures of an orchestra conductor. These events generate prior expectancies regarding the occurrence of future events. Moreover, these expectancies play a critical role in conveying expressive qualities and communicative intent through the movement; thus they are of considerable interest in musical control contexts. To this end, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework which we call the temporal expectancy model and use it to develop an analysis tool for capturing expressive and indicative qualities of the conducting gesture based on temporal expectancies. The temporal expectancy model is a general dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) that can be used to encode prior knowledge regarding temporal structure to improve event segmentation. The conducting analysis tool infers beat and tempo, which are indicative and articulation which is expressive, as well as temporal expectancies regarding beat (ictus and preparation instances) from conducting gesture. Experimental results using our analysis framework reveal a very strong correlation in how significantly the preparation expectancy builds up for staccato vs legato articulation, which bolsters the case for temporal expectancy as cognitive model for event anticipation, and as a key factor in the communication of expressive qualities of conducting gesture. Our system operates on data obtained from a marker based motion capture system, but can be easily adapted for more affordable technologies like video camera arrays.

Dual-process models of behaviour propose that strong approach biases predict excessive intake when reflective processes are weak. Consistent with theory, early findings indicated that approach biases predicted excessive use of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. Given that reviews on approach bias for appetitive substances are lacking, the current review aimed to synthesise the recent findings on automatic approach biases across three of the most commonly assessed substances: alcohol, food and tobacco.

VL  - 10
IS  - 12
AB  - People working in a cooperative manner need to be updated on events and informed about other users and their activities in their workspaces in order to collaborate effectively. It is necessary that group members feel they are part of the group, in particular when they are geographically dispersed. This kind of information is called awareness and it is an important research aspect in the computer supported cooperative work and computer supported collaborative learning areas. Supporting awareness has important, if subtle, benefits, such as increasing the effectiveness of collaborative work, fostering social relationships, and improving the general wellbeing of individuals. To create and define awareness mechanisms in collaborative environments supported by computers is a complex process that includes several steps that need to be considered, focused on understanding characteristics of interdependent group work with the objective of designing adequate computer-based technology to support cooperative work processes. However, in the literature it is so difficult to find out a structured method that allow designers to develop collaborative applications centered on awareness aspects. This paper proposes the definition of a framework that could assist groupware engineers to incorporate awareness mechanisms in their developments. This framework has a methodological proposal or set of phases to follow, as well as a taxonomy that includes the awareness information that should be incorporated to improve the collaborative experience. The paper presents a review of several awareness mechanisms, frameworks and uses proposed in the literature from a software engineering perspective, focusing on the aspects to be considered when designing and implementing awareness mechanisms in groupware tools. A descriptive theory of awareness for the purpose of supporting groupware development is thus generated. Finally, a case study is described using the framework proposed.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Mobile context-aware systems are becoming more and more popular due to the rapid evolution of personal mobile devices. The variety of sensors that are available on such devices allow building intelligent applications that adapt automatically to user preferences and needs. Together with a growth of such self-adaptable systems, number of tools for collecting, visualising and modelling context were developed. However, there is still a need for tools and methods that will support building mobile context-aware systems at the very early stage of development. Such solutions should provide mechanisms for collecting, visualising and initial preprocessing of data to allow better understanding of processes, patterns and dynamics of mobile contextual data. In this paper we propose ContextViewer– a toolkit that aims at providing such mechanisms. It is a part of a methodology for building context-aware systems that besides ContextViewer includes also modelling methods and runtime environment for executing models.

BT  - Processing of Visible Language
SP  - 7
EP  - 36
PB  - Springer US
CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - The first part of this paper reviews recent data on how the characteristics of eye movements in reading depend on three classes of experimental variables: those related to the reader (age, reading skill); those related to the material being read (overall appearance, difficulty, word length); and a third class, the attitude of the reader toward the text (search versus comprehension).In the second part, a distinction is made between global eye movement measures (average over a number of lines of text), and local ones (measures made for a single position on text). Local measures are of interest because of the psycholinguists hope that they will reflect ongoing sentence processing. For this hope to be realistic, it must be shown that the eye movement control mechanisms are sufficiently rapid to allow the eye’s course to be adjusted immediately on the basis of the information being gathered at every instant. The evidence presently available shows the possibility of immediate control of fixation duration, and “almost immediate” control of saccade size.Reading is a basic and constant occupation for most people. We are bombarded by written material, words pop out of posters and signs and, even if we try to avoid them, our eyes seem driven to read them.

AB  - This paper presents methods and tools for gathering, analyzing and predicting behavior patterns. Considered both for a single user and for groups of users, behavior patterns may impact at a local and/or global level. The first part explains how to gather behaviors in various situations and how to drill from overt behaviors into deeper cognitive processes. The rationale of cognitive modeling and guidelines to perform it are provided. The second part deals with analysis methods that enable to detect behavior patterns. Bottom-up analysis based on existing data is augmented with top-down analysis based on conceptual design choices and hypotheses. The last part emphasizes the needs of data storage and data sharing in the organization. Beyond data storage and sharing, it presents the benefits of using Adaptive Business Intelligence in order to simulate and predict possible situations as well as the appropriated behavior patterns that enable to adapt.

EP  - 411
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
AB  - Happy, surprised, disgusted, angry, sad, fearful, and neutral faces were presented extrafoveally, with fixations on faces allowed or not. The faces were preceded by a cue word that designated the face to be saccaded in a two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task (2AFC; Experiments 1 and 2), or were followed by a probe word for recognition (Experiment 3). Eye tracking was used to decompose the recognition process into stages. Relative to the other expressions, happy faces (1) were identified faster (as early as 160 msec from stimulus onset) in extrafoveal vision, as revealed by shorter saccade latencies in the 2AFC task; (2) required less encoding effort, as indexed by shorter first fixations and dwell times; and (3) required less decision-making effort, as indicated by fewer refixations on the face after the recognition probe was presented. This reveals a happy-face identification advantage both prior to and during overt attentional processing. The results are discussed in relation to prior neurophysiological findings on latencies in facial expression recognition.

AB  - The representational change theory of insight claims that insight problems cause impasses because they mislead problem solvers into constructing inappropriate initial representations. Insight is attained when the initial representation is changed. In the present study (N = 24), we tested three specific implications of these hypotheses against eye movements recorded while participants solved matchstick arithmetic problems. The results were consistent with the predictions, providing converging evidence with prior findings using solution rates and solution times. Alternative theories of insight can explain individual findings, but only the representational change theory accounts for both the performance data and the eye movement data. The present study also suggests that eye movement recordings provide an important new window into processes of insight problem solving.

Our aim is to propose a different point of view as we intend to present how we can understand and analyze a point pattern through intensity and conditional intensity functions. We present these key-ingredients theoretically and in an intuitive way. Then, we list some of the main spatial point processes models and provide their main characteristics, in particular, when available the form of their intensity and conditional intensity functions. Finally, we provide a non exhaustive list of statistical methodologies to estimate these functions and discuss the pros and cons of each method.

AB  - This chapter describes work focusing on the reanalysis of long-distance dependencies, specifically wh-questions, instead of phrase-structure reanalysis. It will show that holding all the above aspects constant, there is still a difference in reanalysis between who and which dependencies. In particular, I will show that reanalyzing a strictly grammatical dependency is more costly than reanalyzing a coindexing relation. This difference will be attributed to the type of linguistic relation that who and which enter into, namely an antecedent government chain (who) and a binding chain (which). The finding has been motivated by experimental data on Italian (cf. De Vincenzi, in press), but it also accounts for some experimental data collected in English (cf. Carlson & Tanenhaus, 1988), therefore showing the cross-linguistic validity of such a difference in reanalysis.

JO  - Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
SP  - 1512
EP  - 1519
VL  - 80
IS  - 6
AB  - Reading research is exhibiting growing interest in employing variants of the flanker paradigm to address several questions about reading. The paradigm is particularly suited for investigating parallel word processing, parafoveal-on-foveal influences, and visuospatial attention in a simple but constrained setting. However, this methodological deviation from natural reading warrants careful assessment of the extent to which cognitive processes underlying reading operate similarly in these respective settings. The present study investigated whether readers’ distribution of attention in the flanker paradigm resembles that observed during sentence reading; that is, with a rightward bias. Participants made lexical decisions about foveal target words while we manipulated parafoveal flanking words. In line with prior research, we established a parafoveal-on-foveal repetition effect, and this effect was increased for rightward flankers compared with leftward flankers. In a second experiment, we found that, compared with a no-flanker condition, rightward repetition flankers facilitated target processing, while leftward flankers interfered. Additionally, the repetition effect was larger for rightward than for leftward flankers. From these findings, we infer that attention in the flanker paradigm is indeed biased toward the right, and that the flanker paradigm thus provides an effective analogy to natural reading for investigating the role of visuospatial attention. The enhanced parafoveal-on-foveal effects within the attended region further underline the key role of attention in the spatial integration of orthographic information. Lastly, we conclude that future research employing the flanker paradigm should take the asymmetrical aspect of the attentional deployment into account.

Moreover, we describe the results of an exploratory study in which the event logs of 6 developers using Eclipse together with Rabbit Eclipse were analyzed using process mining. Our results demonstrate the potential of process mining to better understand how developers’ approach a given programming task.

BCIs based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have shown high system speeds in many studies. However, some major issues need to be addressed: On the one hand, the strength of VEP responses varies across subjects. Especially age-related performance differences have been covered in several studies and need to be investigated further. On the other hand, the stimuli used to evoke the VEP response, are considered annoying for many people.

VL  - 21
IS  - 2
AB  - For decisions in the wild, time is of the essence. Available decision time is often cut short through natural or artificial constraints, or is impinged upon by the opportunity cost of time. Experimental economists have only recently begun to conduct experiments with time constraints and to analyze response time (RT) data, in contrast to experimental psychologists. RT analysis has proven valuable for the identification of individual and strategic decision processes including identification of social preferences in the latter case, model comparison/selection, and the investigation of heuristics that combine speed and performance by exploiting environmental regularities. Here we focus on the benefits, challenges, and desiderata of RT analysis in strategic decision making. We argue that unlocking the potential of RT analysis requires the adoption of process-based models instead of outcome-based models, and discuss how RT in the wild can be captured by time-constrained experiments in the lab. We conclude that RT analysis holds considerable potential for experimental economics, deserves greater attention as a methodological tool, and promises important insights on strategic decision making in naturally occurring environments.

AB  - In this introductory paper, we begin by making the case for Computational Health Science, which we define as the interdisciplinary efforts of health scientists, computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, and other social scientists, to conduct innovative research that will inform future practice directed at changing health behavior through improved communication, networking, and social capital. We recognize and discuss some of the main challenges involved with such an enterprise, but also highlight the associated benefits, which, we argue, significantly outweigh them. We then provide a brief summary of the contributions to this first Special Issue on Computational Health Science.

AB  - Fear of crime has been the focus of scientific enquiry for more than fifty years. In this time a number of studies have explored the impact of fear of crime and neighbourhood disorder on an individual’s quality of life. The present chapter describes what we know about the prevalence of fear of crime and disorder in neighbourhoods and public spaces. In particular, we focus on how fear of crime has been defined and operationalized in prior studies, what models are used to understand fear of crime, and the impacts of fear on both individuals and society more broadly. Moreover, we describe some of the recent developments in capturing fear of crime events as they occur in the here and now, and how this innovative work using mobile technologies may contribute new knowledge to understanding the prevalence of crime fear and disorder within the proximate environment. Finally, we discuss “what works” in response to reducing fear of crime in neighbourhoods and public spaces, and how such interventions may improve overall quality of life.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 163
EP  - 181
VL  - 26
IS  - 1
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that the subjective experience of recollection is diminished in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to neurotypical individuals. The neurocognitive basis of this difference in how past events are re-experienced has been debated and various theoretical accounts have been proposed to date. Although each existing theory may capture particular features of memory in ASD, recent research questions whether any of these explanations are alone sufficient or indeed fully supported. This review first briefly considers the cognitive neuroscience of how episodic recollection operates in the neurotypical population, informing predictions about the encoding and retrieval mechanisms that might function atypically in ASD. We then review existing research on recollection in ASD, which has often not distinguished between different theoretical explanations. Recent evidence suggests a distinct difficulty engaging recollective retrieval processes, specifically the ability to consciously reconstruct and monitor a past experience, which is likely underpinned by altered functional interactions between neurocognitive systems rather than brain region-specific or process-specific dysfunction. This integrative approach serves to highlight how memory research in ASD may enhance our understanding of memory processes and networks in the typical brain. We make suggestions for future research that are important for further specifying the neurocognitive basis of episodic recollection in ASD and linking such difficulties to social developmental and educational outcomes.

JO  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics
SP  - 1115
EP  - 1136
VL  - 53
IS  - 12
AB  - Ethanol (alcohol) is one of the most widely used legal drugs in the world. Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 drug-metabolizing enzyme that is also responsible for the biotransformation of xenobiotics and fatty acids. Drugs that inhibit ADH or CYP2E1 are the most likely theoretical compounds that would lead to a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with ethanol, which include only a limited number of drugs. Acute ethanol primarily alters the pharmacokinetics of other drugs by changing the rate and extent of absorption, with more limited effects on clearance. Both acute and chronic ethanol use can cause transient changes to many physiologic responses in different organ systems such as hypotension and impairment of motor and cognitive functions, resulting in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Evaluating drug interactions with long-term use of ethanol is uniquely challenging. Specifically, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of long-term ethanol use on liver pathology and chronic malnutrition. Ethanol-induced liver disease results in decreased activity of hepatic metabolic enzymes and changes in protein binding. Clinical studies that include patients with chronic alcohol use may be evaluating the effects of mild cirrhosis on liver metabolism, and not just ethanol itself. The definition of chronic alcohol use is very inconsistent, which greatly affects the quality of the data and clinical application of the results. Our study of the literature has shown that a significantly higher volume of clinical studies have focused on the pharmacokinetic interactions of ethanol and other drugs. The data on pharmacodynamic interactions are more limited and future research addressing pharmacodynamic interactions with ethanol, especially regarding the non-central nervous system effects, is much needed.

JO  - The Visual Computer
SP  - 1189
EP  - 1207
VL  - 34
IS  - 9
AB  - The assignment of labels to data instances is a fundamental prerequisite for many machine learning tasks. Moreover, labeling is a frequently applied process in visual interactive analysis approaches and visual analytics. However, the strategies for creating labels usually differ between these two fields. This raises the question whether synergies between the different approaches can be attained. In this paper, we study the process of labeling data instances with the user in the loop, from both the machine learning and visual interactive perspective. Based on a review of differences and commonalities, we propose the “visual interactive labeling” (VIAL) process that unifies both approaches. We describe the six major steps of the process and discuss their specific challenges. Additionally, we present two heterogeneous usage scenarios from the novel VIAL perspective, one on metric distance learning and one on object detection in videos. Finally, we discuss general challenges to VIAL and point out necessary work for the realization of future VIAL approaches.

BT  - Psycholinguistic and Sociolinguistic Perspectives on Second Language Learning and Teaching: Studies in Honor of Waldemar Marton
SP  - 115
EP  - 136
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The Idiom Decomposition Hypothesis (Gibbs et al. 1989) states that, depending on compositionality, i.e., the degree to which idiom components contribute to the overall figurative interpretation, idioms will differ with regard to their storage and processing. However, research results concerning processing differences between idioms varying along the dimension of compositionality are mixed and equivocal. The present paper aims to address this controversial issue by exploring the role of compositionality in the course of processing idioms by second language users. The study employed a cross-modal priming technique in which English decomposable and nondecomposable idioms were embedded in sentences (e.g. ‘George wanted to bury the hatchet soon after Susan left’) and presented auditorily via headphones to Polish fluent speakers of English. While participants were listening to the sentence, a target word related figuratively (e.g. FORGIVE) or literally (e.g. AXE) to the idiom was presented on the computer screen for a lexical decision either at the end of the idiom or before the last word of the idiom. Contrary to the predictions of the Idiom Decomposition Hypothesis (Gibbs and Nayak 1989; Gibbs et al. 1989), figurative meanings of decomposable idioms were not available faster than those of nondecomposable idioms. In addition, strong activation was found for literal meanings of idiom constituents, in line with previous L2 processing research (Kecskes 2000; Liontas 2002; Abel 2003).

AB  - This chapter draws upon O’Brien’s Process Model of User Engagement to situate the game experience literature on digital games. The temporal aspects of game play are characterised at the different stages of engagement: from point of engagement, through sustained engagement, disengagement and re-engagement This analysis highlights that the Process Model fails to capture two essential aspects of digital game engagement: individual differences, or why specific people play specific games; and the way in which players engage outside of the game, for example, thinking about the game when they are not playing it, which may result in looking for information that will support and progress game play at a future point. This challenges the general approach of conceptualising engagement in games as occurring within a single gaming session.

AB  - When the biofeedback research worker or clinician conducts an experiment or carries out treatment using biofeedback displays, it is commonly observed by the experimenter or clinician that he is unable to provide the subject or patient with precise instructions as to how control may be achieved over the function that is being studied. Following the completion of the experiment or treatment, and assuming some success in obtaining control over the function, it is equally commonly observed by the subjects or patients that they are unable to describe what they did to achieve control. The inability on the part of the experimenter or clinician to instruct the subject or patient how to achieve control, and the inability of the subject or patient to tell the experimenter or clinician how control was achieved appear to have caused a great deal of concern. It is the primary intent of this chapter to show that the concern is misplaced and based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of biofeedback and the purpose of biofeedback training. As a consequence, a good deal of inappropriate research has been carried out in a vain and unnecessary search for certain presumed “mediators” of biofeedback control. It is not, of course, being asserted that mediation does not occur in biofeedback; what is being asserted is that the mediation which occurs is quite other than that which it is commonly assumed to be and that it is not in the least surprising or a matter for concern that subjects and patients are unable to “explain” their success when they achieve it. Indeed, in terms of the theoretical position to be developed here, it would be neither expected nor desirable that increased control following biofeedback training will be accompanied by an “understanding” of how the increased control was achieved.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 165
EP  - 193
VL  - 31
IS  - 2
AB  - Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate whether the processing of subject-verb dependencies is influenced by (1) the linear distance between the subject and the verb and (2) the presence of an intervening noun phrase with interfering number features. Linear distance did not affect integration and diagnosis or revision processes at the verb, as indexed by early negative and P600 components. This is in accordance with hierarchy-based models of reanalysis, but is problematic for distance-based integration models. However, tracking of the subject features is affected by linear factors: more judgment errors were made in the long compared to the short condition. Furthermore, the presence of a plural object between the singular subject and the verb led to more judgment errors, and an enhanced positivity around 250 ms for the grammatical verbs. This suggests that linear factors affect feature tracking, but not integration processes following feature retrieval or repair processes following the detection of a mismatch.

AB  - Several levels of automated driving functions require the human as a fallback driver in case system performance limits are exceeded. Human factors research in this area is especially concerned with human performance in these take-over situations and the influence of the driver state. Based on work of the publicly funded project Ko-HAF the paper introduces a comprehensive model of the transition process from automated driving to manual driving and specifies relevant time stamps and time windows. The concept of Driver Availability is regarded as a quantitative measure that relates the estimated time required to safely take-over manual control to the available time budget. A conceptual framework outlines potential influencing factors on driver availability as well as ways to apply the measure in a real-time application.

JO  - Educational Psychology Review
SP  - 389
EP  - 411
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
AB  - A lot of research has focused on the beneficial effects of using multimedia, that is, text and pictures, for learning. Theories of multimedia learning are based on Baddeley’s working memory model (Baddeley 1999). Despite this theoretical foundation, there is only little research that aims at empirically testing whether and more importantly how working memory contributes to learning from text and pictures; however, a more thorough understanding of how working memory limitations affect learning may help instructional designers to optimize multimedia instruction. Therefore, the goal of this review is to stimulate such empirical research by (1) providing an overview of the methodologies that can be applied to gain insights in working memory involvement during multimedia learning, (2) reviewing studies that have used these methodologies in multimedia research already, and (3) discussing methodological and theoretical challenges of such an approach as well as the usefulness of working memory to explain learning with multimedia.

VL  - 14
IS  - 2
AB  - With the advances in information technology and its increasing impact on humans and society, there has been an expanding need to spread knowledge from domain to domain. This need is not least in the area of human–computer interaction, which includes a rich culture of carrying out usability evaluations in many different domains and technology platforms. This paper aims to show how transfer of methods takes place, by explicating and formalizing the process. It will contribute to the quest for knowledge on the constituents of the process of transferring methodological knowledge and their relationships. A sectoral system of innovation approach is used to analyse the constituents of a selected sector, crisis management, where training is essential and which is rapidly adopting technology for operations and training. Two case studies are described where heuristics evaluation and user testing were applied on simulation software that allows training for crisis management. The analysis results in a process model, describing the transfer of methodological knowledge within the sectoral system of innovation framework.

AB  - Educational multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) have been shown to be effective platforms for situated science inquiry curricula. While researchers find MUVEs to be supportive of collaborative scientific inquiry processes, the complex mix of multi-modal messages present in MUVEs can lead to cognitive overload, with learners unable to effectively process the rich information encountered in virtual space. In this study, we investigated the effect of communication modality on cognitive load and science inquiry learning in students completing a science inquiry curriculum in an educational MUVE. Seventy-eight undergraduate education majors from a large southwestern university participated in this control-treatment study. Significant positive results were found for reducing cognitive load for participants communicating through voice-based chat, although this reduction was not found to influence learning outcomes. We conclude that use of voice-based communication can successfully reduce cognitive load in MUVE-based inquiry curricula.

JO  - Cognitive Neurodynamics
SP  - 317

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - A natural language parser implemented entirely in simulated neurons is described. It produces a semantic representation based on frames. It parses solely using simulated fatiguing Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons, that are a relatively accurate biological model that is simulated efficiently. The model works on discrete cycles that simulate 10 ms of biological time, so the parser has a simple mapping to psychological parsing time. Comparisons to human parsing studies show that the parser closely approximates this data. The parser makes use of Cell Assemblies and the semantics of lexical items is represented by overlapping hierarchical Cell Assemblies so that semantically related items share neurons. This semantic encoding is used to resolve prepositional phrase attachment ambiguities encountered during parsing. Consequently, the parser provides a neurally-based cognitive model of parsing.

AB  - Two experiments investigated whether lexical complexity increases a word’s processing time. Subjects read sentences, each containing a target word, while their eye movements were monitored. In experiment 1, mean fixation time on infrequent words was longer than on their more frequent controls, as was the first fixation after the Infrequent Target. Fixation Times on Causative, factive, and negative verbs and ambiguous nouns were no longer than on their controls. Further analyses on the ambiguous nouns, however, suggested that the likelihood of their various meanings affected fixation time. This factor was investigated in experiment 2. subjects spent a longer time fixating ambiguous words with two equally likely meanings than fixating ambiguous words with one highly likely meaning. The results suggest that verb complexity does not affect lexical access time, and that word frequency And the presence of two highly likely meanings may affect lexical access and/or postaccess integration.

CY  - Cham
AB  - The performance of older adults on neuropsychological (and cognitive) assessment tests can set the perspective on the capabilities of this population in general, hence contributing to ageism. These tests are administered with two implicit assumptions: (a) the tests are a valid gauge of performance in older adults and (b) cognitive abilities decline in older age. In the current chapter, we challenge these assumptions by discussing two potential sources of threat to test validity: the sensory and the social contexts. First, we review findings that age-related decline in performance may reflect, at least in part, a sensory (visual and auditory) rather than a purely cognitive decline. Next, we discuss the negative effect of age-based stereotype threat on older adults’ cognitive performance. Both contexts may be present in daily testing of older adults in the clinic or the lab. Thus, targeting the sensory and social context in neuropsychological assessment may assist in reducing age-bias (leading to ageism) in the scientific, medical and general community.

AB  - Leo Kanner, an Austrian born American psychiatrist, first described autism in 1943 [1]. His observations of a small group of children with behavioral symptoms of social withdrawal, impaired language/communication, and obsession with sameness led to recognition of autism as a specific pervasive developmental disorder. At about the same time, Austrian psychiatrist Hans Asperger independently described similar symptoms in a small group of children except that the “Asperger” children were high functioning with better language and cognitive skills than those described by Kanner [2]. Both Kanner and Asperger used the word autistic to describe the pathology in the children they observed – a term rooted in the Greek “autos” (self) and coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler to describe symptoms in his schizophrenic patients. Before Kanner and Asperger defined autism as a specific disorder, children with autistic symptoms were most likely classed and treated as mentally retarded or, if they were high functioning, perhaps as schizophrenic.

TI  - Response Time Data as Validity Evidence: Has It Lived Up To Its Promise and, If Not, What Would It Take to Do So
BT  - Understanding and Investigating Response Processes in Validation Research
SP  - 159
EP  - 177
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - As a convenient data source from computerized tests, response time could also be very informative evidence for the validity of test scores, offering an opportunity for insights into parts of the test that test takers linger over and other parts of the test where they glide through the material. Given these hopes for, and expectations of, response time data, we should critically evaluate how such data are studied and more importantly, to what extent this type of data lives up to its promise. We begin this chapter by defining response time and briefly discussing its use as validity evidence. We then describe the typical uses of response time data and review the different approaches to studying response time data in various research. The chapter closes with an evaluation of response time data as validity evidence and suggests the conditions that would facilitate better use of response data for validation purposes.

TI  - A Systematic Success Factor Analysis in the Context of Enterprise 2.0: Results of an Exploratory Analysis Comprising Digital Immigrants and Digital Natives
BT  - E-Commerce and Web Technologies
SP  - 163
EP  - 175
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Organizations are increasingly investing in social collaboration and communication platforms for integrated exchange of information within and between enterprises. These Enterprise 2.0 projects always have a deep impact on organizational and cultural changes and need a critical mass of user involvement across all different groups. Users that grew up in the digital age and use new forms of collaborative platforms within their daily activities are often more technologically adept and more willing to share information. This leads to a digital divide between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, which needs to be addressed within such projects. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the perceived differences in success factors for Enterprise 2.0 seen by Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants and its implications on the implementation of a process oriented methodology for Enterprise 2.0 projects.

EP  - 2660
VL  - 51
IS  - 6
AB  - This tutorial describes DynaSearch, a Web-based system that supports process-tracing experiments on coupled-system dynamic decision-making tasks. A major need in these tasks is to examine the process by which decision makers search over a succession of situation reports for the information they need in order to make response decisions. DynaSearch provides researchers with the ability to construct and administer Web-based experiments containing both between- and within-subjects factors. Information search pages record participants’ acquisition of verbal, numeric, and graphic information. Questionnaire pages query participants’ recall of information, inferences from that information, and decisions about appropriate response actions. Experimenters can access this information in an online viewer to verify satisfactory task completion and can download the data in comma-separated text files that can be imported into statistical analysis packages.

TI  - SEQUENCE: a remote control technique to select objects by matching their rhythm
JO  - Personal and Ubiquitous Computing
SP  - 751
EP  - 770
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
AB  - We present SEQUENCE, a novel interaction technique for selecting objects from a distance. Objects display different rhythmic patterns by means of animated dots, and users can select one of them by matching the pattern through a sequence of taps on a smartphone. The technique works by exploiting the temporal coincidences between patterns displayed by objects and sequences of taps performed on a smartphone: if a sequence matches with the pattern displayed by an object, the latter is selected. We propose two different alternatives for displaying rhythmic sequences associated with objects: the first one uses fixed dots (FD), the second one rotating dots (RD). Moreover, we performed two evaluations on such alternatives. The first evaluation, carried out with five participants, was aimed to discover the most appropriate speed for displaying animated rhythmic patterns. The second evaluation, carried out on 12 participants, was aimed to discover errors (i.e., activation of unwanted objects), missed activations (within a certain time), and time of activations. Overall, the proposed design alternatives perform in similar ways (errors, 2.8% for FD and 3.7% for RD; missed, 1.3% for FD and 0.9% for RD; time of activation, 3862 ms for FD and 3789 ms for RD).

VL  - 168

AB  - The interplay of content and context is observable in a moment to moment manner as propositional content unfolds. The current contribution illustrates this through data from real-time language comprehension indicating that propositional content is not computed in isolation but relies in important ways on context during every step of the computation of meaning. The relevant notion of context that we have to adopt includes all aspects of possible worlds and draws on a variety of knowledge representations, which in a first processing phase serve to generate expectations for upcoming words. In a second phase, the discourse representation is assessed and if necessary updated by means of inferential reasoning and enrichment to reflect the speaker’s intended meaning.

For researchers as well as game designers we describe key learning theories to ground their work in theoretical framework. We draw on recent meta-reviews to offer an exhaustive inventory of known learning and affective outcomes in serious games, and to discuss assessment methods valuable not only for research but also for efficient serious game design. The implementation and design of serious games are outlined in separated sections. Different individual characteristics that seem to be strongly affecting process of learning with serious games (learning style, gender and age) are discussed with emphasis on game development.

TI  - Studying Analysts’ Data Triage Operations in Cyber Defense Situational Analysis
BT  - Theory and Models for Cyber Situation Awareness
SP  - 128
EP  - 169
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Cyber defense analysts are playing a critical role in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to make sense of the immense amount of network monitoring data for detecting and responding to cyber attacks, including large-scale cyber attack campaigns involving advanced persistent threats. The network data continuously generated by multiple cyber defense systems, which may contain many false alerts, are overwhelming to the analysts. Analysts often need to make quick decisions/responses in a very short time based on their awareness of the situation at that moment. Data triage is the first and the most fundamental step performed routinely by the analysts — it filters a massive network monitoring data to identify known malicious events. Due to the high noise-to-signal ratio of network monitoring data, this steps accounts for a very significant portion of the time and attention of intrusion detection analysts. Therefore, a smart human-machine system that improves the performance of data triage operation in SOC is highly desirable. In this chapter, we describe a human-centered smart data triage system that leverages the cognitive trace of intrusion detection analysts. Our approach is based on a dynamic cyber-human system that integrates three dimensions: cyber defense analysts, network monitoring data, and attack activities. The approach leverages recorded analytic processes of intrusion detection analysts, which we refer to as “cognitive traces”. These traces of the analysts capture the examples of malicious events detected from the network monitoring data. Such traces from senior analysts provide a powerful opportunity for training junior analysts in performing data triage operations. To realize this potential, we also developed a smart retrieval framework that automatically retrieves traces of other senior analysts based on their similarity to the events already identified by a junior analyst. The traces from analysts, as demonstrated by a case study, also enable us to better understand their analytic processes in a systematic, yet minimum-reactive way. We summarize this chapter by discussing limitations of the proposed framework and the directions of future research regarding improving the data triage operations of cyber defense analysts.

TI  - Measuring morality in videogames research
JO  - Ethics and Information Technology
AB  - There has been a recent surge of research interest in videogames of moral engagement for entertainment, advocacy and education. We have seen a wealth of analysis and several theoretical models proposed, but experimental evaluation has been scarce. One of the difficulties lies in the measurement of moral engagement. How do we meaningfully measure whether players are engaging with and affected by the moral choices in the games they play? In this paper, we survey the various standard psychometric instruments from the moral psychology literature and discuss how they might be applied in the evaluation of games.

SP  - 429
EP  - 448
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of early and continuous validation activities as a means of addressing customer requirements in product development in a better way. At the same time, early validation activities come with additional challenges resulting from a high degree of uncertainty and a lack of resources at this stage. The use of Augmented Reality technology offers a promising approach for addressing these challenges and allows different product variants to be experienced early in the development process, thus generating meaningful customer feedback. However, in many cases, the use of AR technology in product development practice is not target-oriented as it lacks methodological support. Building on this observation, this paper presents a method for supporting the configuration of AR-based validation environments as one of the central preparatory activities for product validation using AR technology. It also introduces a descriptive model for AR-based validation environments laying the theoretical foundations for the method.

AB  - Although diagnostic competence of teachers is regarded as a key component of successful teaching, there are many open questions regarding the structure, the development and the impact of diagnostic competence. This chapter presents an overview of different approaches to pinpoint diagnostic competence theoretically and to investigate it empirically: measuring judgment accuracy, assessing competences in diagnostic situations or analyzing judgment processes. These approaches are discussed with respect to their advantages, restrictions as well as some of their main findings and they are allocated within an overarching model of diagnostic competence as a continuum, comprising diagnostic dispositions, diagnostic thinking and diagnostic performance.

BT  - Advances in Visual Computing
SP  - 137
EP  - 148
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - A challenge for virtual reality (VR) applications is to increase the realism of an observer’s visual experience. For this purpose the variation of the blur that an observer experiences in his/her vision, while he/she focuses on a particular location, can be mimicked by blurring the VR computer graphics based on a model of the blur. The blur in human vision is the result of a combination of optical and neural vision processes; namely optical refraction, non-uniform retinal sampling, and cortical magnification. Due to the complexity of the phenomenon, apparently no theoretical model of the blur has been published. In this work we model the combined effect by means of a probabilistic model of the human visual system. The results from the models match common vision experience verifying the validity of the underlying theoretical considerations. The implementation of the model for increased realism in virtual reality is illustrated by means of a rendering of a virtual reality scene, which is processed for two different acts of focusing.

SP  - 65
EP  - 92
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This chapter gives an overview of the design, implementation, and evaluation of a technology-based assessment (TBA) measuring trainee competencies in the field of economics. Current research on “Industry 4.0” or “digital natives” demonstrates how quickly technological advances change the working world and how important information and communications (ICT) skills already are in the workplace. Digitalization not only entails new requirements for working but also has far-reaching implications for vocational learning and vocational educational design. In line with the idea of triadic assessment (Pellegrino (2012) The design of an assessment system focused on student achievement: A learning sciences perspective on issues of competence, growth and measurement. In: Bernholt, Neumann and Nentwig (eds) Making it tangible. Learning outcomes in science education. Waxmann, Münster, pp 79–107; Pellegrino et al., (2003) Knowing what students know: the science and design of educational assessment. National Academy Press, Washington, DC), this leads to a growing need for appropriate assessments to be aligned with curriculum and instruction. Hence, we introduce an instrument that aims to bridge the gap between work reality and assessment, using a prototype of an authentic workplace simulation. More specifically, this technology-based tool visualizes work and business processes in an industrial enterprise and requires test-takers to act and make decisions in computer-based tasks (e.g., editing text files and tables, answering emails, or dealing with daily test statistics). In order to reflect digitalized workplace processes, technological aspects of real work environments must be didactically modeled and installed as usable features. Thus, the usability of the installed features is crucial, as technical authenticity constitutes a basic requirement of valid assessment. For the purpose of testing the usability of this simulation, a think-aloud study of the user interface was conducted with a total of N = 37 business education students.

AB  - This chapter examines the theoretical foundations of user engagement. First, the definition of user engagement is deconstructed using key principles for evaluating concepts: clarity, scope and meaning. Second, two theoretical frameworks, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow Theory and John Dewey’s Philosophy of Experience, are presented that have informed much work on user engagement over the past decades. Third, several measurement and behavioural models of user engagement are articulated and compared. Though not an exhaustive review of the literature, the chapter identifies key works on user engagement over the past 30 years and areas of consensus and divergence in how user engagement is conceptualized in the research. The purpose of the chapter is not to propose a unified theory of engagement but to present a series of unifying propositions and open questions to inform future studies and to strengthen the theoretical framing of user engagement in theory and application

AB  - The advances in artificial intelligence and the post-Google interests in information retrieval, in the recent decades, have made large-scale processing of human language data possible and produced impressive results in many language processing tasks. However, the wealth and the multilingualism of digital corpora have generated additional challenges for language processing and language technology. To overcome some of the challenges an adequate theory of this complex human language processing system is needed to integrate scientific knowledge from the fields of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, in particular. Over the last few years, emerging applications of NLP have taken a cognitive science perspective recognising that the modelling of the language processing is simply too complex to be addressed within a single discipline. This paper provides a synopsis of the latest emerging trends, methodologies, and applications in NLP with a cognitive science perspective, contributed by the researchers, practitioners, and doctoral students to the international workshops in Natural Language processing and Cognitive Science (NLPCS).

AB  - Background music is one of the critical factors that affect browsers’ behavior on shopping website. This study adopted a laboratory experiment to explore the effects of background music tempo and playing method on cognitive response in an online store. The independent variables were background music tempo (fast vs. slow) and playing method of music (playing the same music continuously, re-playing the same music while browsing different web pages, and playing different music while browsing different web pages). The measures of the shifting frequency between web pages, perceived browsing time, and recalling accuracy of commodity were collected. Results indicated that participants had more shifting frequency and shorter perceived browsing time for fast music tempo than for slow music tempo. The effect of music tempo on recalling accuracy was not significant. Continuous playing method and re-playing method had similar shifting frequency and perceived browsing time. Different method had more shifting frequency, longer perceived time, and less recalling accuracy. Continuous playing had greater accuracy than re-playing method and different method. The findings should help in manipulating background music for online shopping website.

This has been verified in several investigations using factor analysis of large schizophrenic patient populations showing these distinct domains of dysfunction. When clinical symptoms are related to imaging findings, specific brain areas are found to be differentially involved in symptom domains in the illness (Liddle 1987; Carpenter and Buchanan 1989; Kay and Sevy 1990; Arndt et al. 1991; Lenzenweger et al. 1991; Barnes and Liddle 1990; Andreasen et al 1995), with prefrontal (PFC) most involved in executive function and medial temporal lobe (MTL) most associated with declarative memory. Studies defining the anatomy of schizophrenia show delimited regions of brain associated with the symptoms; these include the prefrontal cortex (both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC, and anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) and the MTL as well as the superior temporal gyrus (STG). In this chapter, we review a large and significant body of convergent evidence that demonstrates the importance of the medial temporal lobe as a brain region central to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

SP  - 299

PB  - Springer US
CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - A vast literature in educational psychology attests to the fact that individual differences in learner aptitudes predict learning outcomes. A substantial body of literature also now demonstrates that aptitude variables often interact with instructional treatment variables in these predictions (Cronbach & Snow, 1977). Aptitude main effects and aptitude-instructional treatment interactions (ATI), frequently account for a larger proportion of variation in learning outcome than do treatment main effects alone. ATI findings, in particular, have important implications for the development of instructional theory and research and for instructional improvement. They suggest how instruction can be made adaptive to student differences. But if practical and theoretical use is to be made of these ideas, then individual differences in aptitude for learning will need to be understood at a more analytic process level. Traditional research on aptitude sought mainly to improve the predictive power of measures, and to build a taxonomy of aptitude constructs based on correlational studies. With the growth of a cognitive experimental psychology of information processing, coupled with the development of ATI research on instruction, it now seems possible to pursue a process theory of aptitude. This paper notes some recent findings and reports one new study in a continuing program of research toward obtaining such a theory.

EP  - 229
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Insufficient sleep is a hallmark of our modern busy society, but “burning the candle at both ends” does not come without a cost. The present chapter provides a selective overview of the major effects of sleep deprivation on cognition, including its effects on alertness and vigilance, sensory perception, emotion, learning and memory, and executive functioning. Established research suggests that, without sufficient sleep, simple reaction time is slowed, attentional lapses become longer and more frequent, and in general, behavior becomes increasingly inconsistent and unstable. There are notable individual differences in the ability to resist sleep loss, for which biological or psychological markers have yet to be unequivocally identified. Sleep deprivation can impair some sensory-perceptual processes, particularly visual processing. In addition, sleep loss worsens mood, lowers frustration tolerance, and biases the perception and expression of emotion toward negative affective states. Sleep deprivation also affects memory by reducing encoding when it precedes learning and impairs consolidation of memory traces when it occurs after learning. Some, but not all, aspects of higher order executive functions are impaired by sleep deprivation, but the data in this regard remain inconclusive. Further research will be necessary to disentangle the extent to which deficits in higher order cognitive functions are due to primary executive system dysfunctions versus impairments of more elementary processes such as alertness, attention, and cerebral interconnectivity.

JO  - Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
SP  - 2424
EP  - 2460
VL  - 81
IS  - 7
AB  - In a novel computer mouse tracking paradigm, participants read a spatial phrase such as “The blue item to the left of the red one” and then see a scene composed of 12 visual items. The task is to move the mouse cursor to the target item (here, blue), which requires perceptually grounding the spatial phrase. This entails visually identifying the reference item (here, red) and other relevant items through attentional selection. Response trajectories are attracted toward distractors that share the target color but match the spatial relation less well. Trajectories are also attracted toward items that share the reference color. A competing pair of items that match the specified colors but are in the inverse spatial relation increases attraction over-additively compared to individual items. Trajectories are also influenced by the spatial term itself. While the distractor effect resembles deviation toward potential targets in previous studies, the reference effect suggests that the relevance of the reference item for the relational task, not its role as a potential target, was critical. This account is supported by the strengthened effect of a competing pair. We conclude, therefore, that the attraction effects in the mouse trajectories reflect the neural processes that operate on sensorimotor representations to solve the relational task. The paradigm thus provides an experimental window through motor behavior into higher cognitive function and the evolution of activation in modal substrates, a longstanding topic in the area of embodied cognition.

VL  - 47
IS  - 5
AB  - This study investigated whether Chinese–Korean bilinguals can use structure-based information to interpret Korean sentences containing floating numeral quantifiers during online processing. A numeral quantifier in Korean can be stranded from its modified noun through scrambling as long as the quantifier forms a constituent with the noun. For Chinese–Korean bilinguals, acquiring this structural knowledge gives rise to a learnability problem because this ability cannot be derived from the L1, not easily induced from Korean input and is not obtained through classroom instruction. In acceptability judgment, highly proficient Chinese–Korean bilinguals demonstrated target-like knowledge of this structural constraint. Results from a self-paced reading task showed that the bilinguals showed sensitivity to the violation of the mismatch between an NQ and its modified NP, both in local and non-local dependency conditions. Our findings suggest that structure-based processing is possible for highly proficient bilinguals even when the target structure is not instantiated in bilinguals’ L1.

AB  - This chapter examines Basque, a head-final language with rich agreement, to investigate whether the parser uses agreement information in the auxiliaries to create syntactic predictions about upcoming sentence structure. The paper discusses how a combination of agreement and case marking information can act as a cue to predict the presence of an embedded clause. The study specifically investigates whether indirect cues provided by agreement mismatch between an auxiliary and an adjacent noun phrase are used in order to make inferences about upcoming structure and avoid garden-pathing. The role of agreement information in assisting pre-verbal structure building is examined and related to evidence from other head-final languages such as German and Japanese.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between subjective frequency of literal usage (literalness), subjective frequency of figurative usage (familiarity), and mean Kucera and Francis (1967) word frequency for idiom phrases. Kucera and Francis frequency was found to be independent of both familiarity and literalness. Furthermore, it was found that literalness, but not the Kucera and Francis frequency of the words in the phrase, affected reading time for literal uses of idioms. For figurative uses of idioms, familiarity and written frequency interacted. A model of idiom processing consistent with the current results and previous results is proposed. In addition, subjective familiarity and literalness norms are provided for 245 idioms.

AB  - Experts are imperative for supporting expertise development in apprentices but learning from them is difficult. In many cases, there are shortages of experts to train apprentices. To address this issue, we use wearable sensors and augmented reality to record expert performance for supporting the training of apprentices. In this context, we present the conceptual framework which outlines different instructional design methodologies for training various attributes of a task. These instructional design methodologies are characterized by their dependencies on expert performance and experts as model for training. In addition, they exploit the affordances of modern wearable sensors and augmented reality. The framework also outlines a training workflow based on the 4C/ID model, a pedagogic model for complex learning, which ensures that all aspects of conventional training are considered. The paper concludes with application guidelines and examples along with reflection of the authors.

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - All current software quality assurance methods incorporate some form of formal technical review (FTR), because structured analysis of software artefacts by a team of skilled technical personnel has demonstrated an ability to improve quality. However, FTR methods come in a wide variety of forms with varying effectiveness, incur significant overhead on technical staff, and have little computer support. Measurements of these FTR methods are coarse-grained, frequently low quality, and expensive to obtain. This paper describes CSRS, a highly instrumented, computer-supported system for formal technical review, and shows how it is designed to collect high quality, fine-grained measures of FTR process and products automatically. The paper also discusses some results from over one year of experimentation with CSRS; describes how CSRS improves current process improvement approaches to FTR; and overviews several novel research projects on FTR that are made possible by this system.

SP  - 35

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Retail Category Management addresses a series of questions and demands decisions for category managers on critical issues such as product assortment and shelf-space planning. Product assortment planning involves listing decisions based on consumer behavior and substitution effects. Shelf space allocation involves facing and replenishment decisions based on space elasticity effects and constraints of limited shelf space and restocking capacity. The complexity of these questions has grown significantly in recent years due to product proliferation and various consumer choice effects in the retail environment. It is an increasingly difficult task for category managers to find an effective assortment due to consumer preferences instability and the extremely large number of possible assortments. This chapter presents an updated review on scientific models that deal with assortment and shelf space planning and other related topics, such as consumer response to stock-outs and consumer perceptions of assortment variety. One of the main objectives of this literature review is to show that shelf space allocation models do not clearly and comprehensively address assortment selection, neglect substitution effects between products, and ignore the stochastic nature of demand. Assortment planning models on the other hand mostly ignore shelf space constraints and neglect space depend demand.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - An educational dashboard is a display which visualizes the results of educational data mining in a useful way. Educational data mining and visualization techniques allow teachers and students to monitor and reflect on their online teaching and learning behavior patterns. Previous literature has included such information in the dashboard to support students’ self-knowledge, self-evaluation, self-motivation, and social awareness. Further, educational dashboards are expected to support the smart learning environment, in the perspective that students receive personalized and automatically-generated information on a real-time base, by use of the log files in the Learning Management System (LMS). In this study, we reviewed ten case studies that deal with development and evaluation of such a tool, for supporting students and teachers through educational data mining techniques and visualization technologies. In the present study, a conceptual framework based on Few’s principles of dashboard design and Kirkpatrick’s fourlevel evaluation model was developed to review educational dashboards. Ultimately, this study is expected to evaluate the current state of educational dashboard development and suggest an evaluative tool to judge whether or not the dashboard function is working properly, in both a pedagogical and visual way.

BT  - Reanalysis in Sentence Processing
SP  - 365
EP  - 400
PB  - Springer Netherlands
CY  - Dordrecht
AB  - A common assumption in psycholinguistic theory is that reanalysis is constrained by a preference to preserve certain aspects of the representation built in response to previous input. In this chapter, we discuss this notion of representation-preservation in the wider context of models of reanalysis as a whole, and point out that in order to define a representation-preserving constraint on reanalysis, we must specify not only which aspects of representation should be preserved, but what is meant by the notion of preservation. We propose that the appropriate notion of preservation is that which is assumed in monotonic models of parsing, where structural relations between linguistic elements are updated totally non-destructively from state to state. Previous monotonic theories of parsing have limited themselves to consideration of phrase structure representations. In contrast, we propose a general framework within which one may formulate models which apply the same notion of preservation to other representation types. The framework is discussed with reference to a model which preserves thematic structure.

AB  - Multimedia is an essential and integral part of electronic learning (e-learning). In this study, teaching performance and student learning experience are measured using real-time multimedia processing tools and techniques for the e-learning paradigm. Visual attention and visual engagement analysis are performed using two developed algorithms. Video lectures are recorded and delivered to students in e-learning pedagogical setup, which are examined for the visual attention and visual engagement of the student and teacher, respectively. Proposed methodology integrates the assessment on both student and teacher ends. Multimedia processing of video lectures for teaching performance produces scoring dataset. The same methodology on student end for visual attention is used to investigate student experience. These types of datasets then reduced to time-based datasets from the image-based dataset. Correlation and association of both datasets provide the opportunity to relate both student experience and teaching performance as well as to move forward to create content that is more useful. Computational performance of the developed algorithms is compared using different video lectures with their processed frames per second, which is analyzed as per their corresponding bins. Mean, max, and median of the processed frames of all the processed videos are also compared.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We have analysed the basic characteristics of music playback at sight-reading of three two-line classic music selections of varying textures and complexity: a two-voice polyphonic musical piece, a theme and a variation of homophonic-harmonic musical piece. These characteristics serve as objective indicators of the musicians’ skill of sight-reading, and the complexity of musical selection. Applying an original technique of eye movement recording without fixating the head, we studied the eye-hand span i.e. the time from reading the text to music playback. Our findings reveal, that the eye-hand span depends on the texture of the performed musical piece and inversely correlates with the number of errors as well as directly correlates with the rate of stability in the performance. This parameter may serve as an objective measure of the sight-reading ability. It is connected with the complexity of a musical piece and, presumably, characterizes the working memory capacity of musicians.

Evidence based on response processes has been an overlooked source of validity evidence, but one that offers much promise and strength to support the inferences we make from test scores and to provide explanations for test score variance. In this chapter, we address the critical, but often overlooked step of defining response processes. We next take a brief look back at some key moments and players in the history of response processes theorizing and research. We also examine the prevalence of validity evidence based on response processes reported in the published research literature. We conclude by setting a course for the future.

VL  - 25
IS  - 1
AB  - Most engineers and designers prefer to use large drawing boards such as whiteboards or flip charts for the initial collaborative sketching of a system’s models. Large interactive displays have recently begun to replace these physical drawing boards, blurring the line between freehand sketching and toolkit-aided modeling. While digital boards offer more flexibility in drawing and navigating models, they must also provide appropriate cognitive support for frequent shifts of focus and navigation between related artifacts. Furthermore, automated assistance in uncovering potential inconsistencies and contradictions between model sketches would be beneficial so that users do not get lost amid their sketches. In this paper, we discuss an approach to create relationships between the elements of informal hand-drawn sketches on large interactive displays by combining fuzzy search with classic information retrieval techniques. The identification and maintenance of relationships is particularly challenging because we are working with hand-drawn and hand-lettered model sketches rather than the syntactically clean models created with digital modeling toolkits. We evaluated our approach by analyzing 89 model sketches from 16 industry projects and found that it identifies relations between sketched model elements with high precision and recall.

JO  - Memory & Cognition
SP  - 266
EP  - 282
VL  - 43
IS  - 2
AB  - The traditional supervised classification paradigm encourages learners to acquire only the knowledge needed to predict category membership (a discriminative approach). An alternative that aligns with important aspects of real-world concept formation is learning with a broader focus to acquire knowledge of the internal structure of each category (a generative approach). Our work addresses the impact of a particular component of the traditional classification task: the guess-and-correct cycle. We compare classification learning to a supervised observational learning task in which learners are shown labeled examples but make no classification response. The goals of this work sit at two levels: (1) testing for differences in the nature of the category representations that arise from two basic learning modes; and (2) evaluating the generative/discriminative continuum as a theoretical tool for understand learning modes and their outcomes. Specifically, we view the guess-and-correct cycle as consistent with a more discriminative approach and therefore expected it to lead to narrower category knowledge. Across two experiments, the observational mode led to greater sensitivity to distributional properties of features and correlations between features. We conclude that a relatively subtle procedural difference in supervised category learning substantially impacts what learners come to know about the categories. The results demonstrate the value of the generative/discriminative continuum as a tool for advancing the psychology of category learning and also provide a valuable constraint for formal models and associated theories.

AB  - One’s “attention” is said to appear in the visual behavior, i.e. eye and head movements and human brain is thought to set visual attention area in the sight to get visual information efficiently. In head-eye coordination head movements are thought to be controlled to fit the sight to visual attention area. Hence, setting of the attention area can appear in head movements. In this study head and eye movements were measured using a wearable head and eye tracker system newly developed in this study, and were studied whether the visual attention could be known from head movements or not. Results show that, head-movements toward new attended area occur when human wants to switch the visual attention.

JO  - Psychological Research
SP  - 66

VL  - 64
IS  - 1
AB  - One of the fundamental properties of spatial vision is the ability to localize objects in space. According to a recent proposal, accurate localization performance involves the operation of two systems: the attention system and the eye movement system. Upon stimulus presentation, attention is shifted to the target area: this provides coarse location information. Subsequently, a saccadic eye movement is executed: this provides fine location information. In this study we tested predictions derived from this model concerning the effects of precue information on localization performance. In a series of five experiments we manipulated duration of precue (71, 400, and 1,000 ms) and type of precue (spatial versus symbolic). Results showed that very short duration (i.e., 71 ms) spatial precues improved localization performance whereas very short duration symbolic precues did not. In contrast, the 1,000 ms duration precue condition showed similar amounts of precuing benefit for the spatial and symbolic precues. This pattern of differential precuing effects corroborated the two-process model of localization performance.

JO  - Journal of Psycholinguistic Research
SP  - 529
EP  - 547
VL  - 30
IS  - 5
AB  - Locally ambiguous NP1 NP2 V clauses in Dutch are preferably assigned a subject-object rather than an object-subject interpretation, presumably on the basis of structurally based principles such as the Active-Filler Strategy. The present study investigates whether this preference can be affected by a nonconfigurational factor, namely the nature of NP2. The type of an NP (indefinite NPs, full definite NPs, pronouns) conveys information about the discourse status of the NP referent, which, in turn, is associated with a specific syntactic position. More specifically, pronouns are used to refer to given, salient entities in the discourse (topics); and NPs with such referents are generally encoded in subject position. A self-paced reading experiment shows that NP1 NP2 V relative clauses are preferably interpreted as subject-object when NP2 is a full definite NP (e.g., de vrouwen “the women”), but not when NP2 is the second person pronoun jullie (“you”-PL). This suggests that the structural bias for a subject-first order is not as strong as has been previously assumed, but is influenced by discourse information encoded in the NPs. Implications for parsing models are discussed.

AB  - Advertising investment on the Internet is currently growing at a faster rate than in all other means of communication. Specifically, companies’ integrated marketing communications (IMC) are using the Internet as a main means of advertising and, increasingly, social networks as part of their communication strategies. Given their growing importance, this chapter performs an exhaustive theoretical analysis of the efficacy of online advertising. First, we perform a detailed inventory of the main forms of advertising used on the Web and social networking sites. Afterward, we analyze the variables shown, through literature, to be most influential on online advertising effectiveness, paying special attention to the banner ad format. Next, the topic of advertising effectiveness in the specific context of social network sites is discussed. In conclusion, some relevant implications for practitioners and research opportunities are presented.

AB  - Most people think that the hormone testosterone especially triggers aggression and antisocial behavior in humans. Mistakenly, the male sex steroid principally underlies each and every aspect of human social behavior but especially social dominance behavior. Testosterone by itself or by way of its metabolite, estradiol, the female sex steroid, is essential in the action of the social peptides oxytocin and vasopressin and regulates the turnover of the social monoamines, dopamine and serotonin. The hormone also has many other actions in the brain; thus the social brain’s main chemical, without exaggeration, is testosterone. Here we review a line of findings with placebo-controlled testosterone administration in the field of social neuroscience in which various techniques are used to investigate social dominance and trustworthiness behaviors. These findings give insights into how and by what biobehavioral mechanisms testosterone acts in humans to motivate them to establish and maintain a dominant status.

AB  - Psychological approaches have played a central role in electoral research at least since the publication of The American Voter (Campbell et al. 1976). The early work drew from the then dominant currents in social psychology. In the 1960s, this meant a heavy emphasis on beliefs and attitudes. Thus, the Michigan voting model gave a central place to partisan attachments, perceptions of the issues, and appraisals of political candidates. It also took a close look at the manner in which voters reasoned about political parties, candidates, and issues, demonstrating for the United States that ideological constraint played a relatively minor role. While the early attempts at psychologizing the vote choice were not without detractors, their success and impact can be measured by their continued appeal and the large volume of studies that have been produced in this framework.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a framework for developing an interactive feedback model of manned-unmanned teaming (MUT) operational mode selections for a broad spectrum of unmanned vehicle (UV) autonomy levels. Though the highest autonomy levels are within reach as technology continues to advance, lower level autonomy or human manual control will still be needed depending on mission scenarios and dynamic situations. Understanding when and how we change the autonomy level of MUT is critical to ensure system safety and to maximize system performance. Thus, we propose to integrate feedback from various human state variables (i.e., physiological and behavioral signals such as heart rate, skin conductance level, and postures) for estimating human workload and interest level and key task performance measures (accuracy and speed for assigned missions, task interaction) into MUT systems so that the MUT adapts its mode automatically as needed. We developed RESCHU-SA (Research Environment for Supervisory Control of Heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles Swarm Attacks), a modified version of the RESCHU simulator originally developed at MIT. We designed a human-in-the-loop experiment to collect baseline data for varying levels of autonomy using the RESCHU-SA along with a physiological sensor BioHarness. Different levels of autonomy include 1) high level autonomy using an auction algorithm or nearest-neighbor assignment algorithm, 2) low level autonomy using manual assignment, and 3) interactive autonomy which allows operators to change between high and low autonomy level. The purpose of the research is to investigate the level of autonomy that should be given to unmanned vehicles (UVs) to successfully complete a mission using a MUT in a swarm attack scenario.

AB  - In knowledge-work, there are increasing amounts of complex information rendered by information technology, which has led to the common term, information overload. Information visualization is one area where empirically tested semantic theory has not yet caught up with that of the underlying information storage and retrieval theory, contributing to information overload. In spite of a vast body of cognitive theory, much of the human factors research on information visualization has overlooked it. Specifically, information displays have facilitated the data gathering (ontological) aspects of human problem-solving and decision-making, but have exacerbated the meaning-making (epistemological) aspects of those activities by presenting information in linear rather than in graphical (holistic) forms. Drawing from extant empirical research, we present a thesis suggesting that cognitive load may be reduced when holistic information is imbued with transformational grammar to help alleviate the information overload problem, along with a methodological approach for investigation.

AB  - The chapter begins with an explication of Antonio Damasio’s conception of the tripartite brain before moving to the System 1 and System 2 model of decision-making as theorised by Daniel Kahneman. This is followed by an explication of human beings as world-forming, and a discussion about how while certain elements of neuromarketing see the consumer as an agentic individual, the discourse nevertheless seems to return to some form of instrumentalism when practitioners begin to speak about how to ‘treat’ consumers. In other words, while neuromarketing practitioners might understand consumers as agentic, the discourse comprises representations that depict consumers as energy resources to be exploited for material gain.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 1301
EP  - 1330
VL  - 25
IS  - 4
AB  - The biasing role of stereotypes is a central theme in social cognition research. For example, to understand the role of race in police officers’ decisions to shoot, participants have been shown images of Black and White males and instructed to shoot only if the target is holding a gun. Findings show that Black targets are shot more frequently and more quickly than Whites. The decision to shoot has typically been modeled and understood as a signal detection process in which a sample of information is compared against a criterion, with the criterion set for Black targets being lower. We take a different approach, modeling the decision to shoot as a dynamic process in which evidence is accumulated over time until a threshold is reached. The model accounts for both the choice and response time data for both correct and incorrect decisions using a single set of parameters. Across four studies, this dynamic perspective revealed that the target’s race did not create an initial bias to shoot Black targets. Instead, race impacted the rate of evidence accumulation with evidence accumulating faster to shoot for Black targets. Some participants also tended to be more cautious with Black targets, setting higher decision thresholds. Besides providing a more cohesive and richer account of the decision to shoot or not, the dynamic model suggests interventions that may address the use of race information in decisions to shoot and a means to measure their effectiveness.

AB  - In the case of multilingual speakers, who are in the focus of attention of the present work, the complexity involved in L1 lexical storage and processing, discussed in the previous chapter, is further multiplied by the complications added by other lexical systems, those of L2, L3, Ln. Probably, the most enduring questions in psycholinguistic research on bilingual and, more recently, multilingual mental lexicon that have been repeatedly posed by researchers since the 1960s (that is, since the beginning of extensive psycholinguistic research on bilingual and, later, multilingual mental representation and processing), concern separate/integrated storage and selective/non-selective access and as such, are both linked to the discussion about dependence/interdependence dichotomy.

TI  - Design factors in mouse-tracking: What makes a difference?
JO  - Behavior Research Methods
AB  - Investigating cognitive processes by analyzing mouse movements has become a popular method in many psychological disciplines. When creating mouse-tracking experiments, researchers face many design choices—for example, whether participants indicate responses by clicking a button or just by entering the button area. Hitherto, numerous different settings have been employed, but little is known about how these methodological differences affect mouse-tracking data. We systematically investigated the influences of three central design factors, using a classic mouse-tracking paradigm in which participants classified typical and atypical exemplars. In separate experiments, we manipulated the response indication, mouse sensitivity, and starting procedure. The core finding that mouse movements deviate more toward the nonchosen option for atypical exemplars was replicated in all conditions. However, the size of this effect varied. Specifically, it was larger when participants indicated responses via click and when they were instructed to initialize the movement early. Trajectory shapes also differed between setups. For example, a dynamic start led to mostly curved trajectories, responses via click led to a mix of straight and “change-of-mind” trajectories, and responses via touch led to mostly straight trajectories. Moreover, the distribution of curvature indices was classified as bimodal in some setups and as unimodal in others. Because trajectory curvature and shape are frequently used to make inferences about psychological theories, such as differentiating between dynamic and dual-system models, this study shows that the specific design must be carefully considered when drawing theoretical inferences. All methodological designs and analyses were implemented using open-source software and are available from https://osf.io/xdp7a/.

AB  - The HOVISSE (Haptic Osteosynthesis Virtual Intra- operative Surgery Support Environment) project is a medical virtual reality research undertaking conducted in collaboration with the University Hospital of Basel and the Computer Science Department of the University of Basel. The HOVISSE project aims to develop a framework of software applications that provide a seamless digital support environment for osteosynthesis in trauma care. It offers assistance, beginning with the pre-operative planning phase when a surgeon can interactively select and position the fracture-appropriate implant in a 3D visio-haptic immersive environment. The surgeon’s support extends to the intra-operative surgery phase, where a simulation of the medical procedures in the operating room allow the optimization of the surgical intervention. By integrating these subsystems into an interoperable system, the project improves the osteosynthesis workflow through coherent and consistent data access during the entire fracture reduction process.

AB  - This study investigated the perceptual identification of individuals’ intended expression intensity in point-light displays depicting dance. Participants watched point-light displays of 200–1,000-ms duration, as well as static displays, of expressive and inexpressive dance performances. The task was to identify the intended expression intensity of the performer. The results indicate that expression intensity could be discerned reliably only from dynamic displays, even when they were as short as 200 ms, though the accuracy of judgments increased with exposure duration. Judgment accuracy for dynamic displays was positively correlated with self-report empathy indices and confidence in judgments. Accuracy for these displays also correlated with indices of informal music and dance experience. The findings are discussed in relation to sensorimotor and cognitive-emotional processes underlying action understanding and social cognition.

AB  - For designing the rounded communication between human and agent, humanlike appearance of agent can contribute to human understandability towards their intension. However, the excessive humanlike-ness can cause human to feel repulsive against the agent, which is well known as the uncanny valley. In this study, we propose a model providing an explanation for how the human negative response is fomred, based on the brain regions and its function, including the amygdala, hippocampus, cortex and striatum. This model is described with quantitative reasoning and simulated. The results indicate that as human observes a humanlike agent, the emotion goes negative and the brain regions were more activated in comparison with the case human observes a person.

BT  - Handbook of Mindfulness and Self-Regulation

EP  - 63
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - There is increasing evidence that automatic mental processes contribute to self-regulation failures such as eating high-fat foods despite being on a diet and getting trapped in old ways of thinking about problems that require a novel response. Mindfulness meditation, which was developed to overcome habitual patterns of the mind that contribute to human suffering, holds great promise as a strategy to improve self-regulation. This chapter examines the idea that mindfulness may facilitate self-regulation by influencing automatic processes and their relation with subsequent cognition and behavior. After beginning with a discussion of the functional value of automatic processes, the chapter continues with a review of how these processes contribute to self-regulation failure. Next, a theoretical discussion is presented concerning mindfulness and how it might moderate automatic processes. After presenting a review of research addressing this topic, the chapter concludes with suggestions for future work.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of two design principles as prescribed by the cognitive theory of multimedia learning on the situational interest of adult learners in a multimedia-based continuing education training program. One hundred and two adult learners employed by an emergency medical service were randomly assigned to one of three training groups designed to follow modality and redundancy design principles: animation-text, animation-narration, and animation-narration-text. A pretest was administered to participants in segments and presented to participants intermittently during the content in an attempt to reduce unintentional negative effects on interest, and a posttest was administered after participants submitted the self-reporting survey intended to measure situational interest in a multimedia-learning environment. An ANOVA was used to analyze the differences in situational interest between the groups, and independent t-tests were used to evaluate differences. The results of the study indicated that combinations of animation, narration, and text do influence the situational interest of learners. These results highlight the importance of carefully considering how to design multimedia environments for maximum impact on learners and specifically the implications of violating the redundancy design principle.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In a network of organizations, members are often faced with the problem of choosing partners for closer cooperation within this network. Consequently, network members collect information about potential partners to reach informed decisions about for instance starting new joint development projects or harvesting best practices. The large amounts of information involved in these decision processes obscure possibilities, and choices are made ad hoc. In this paper, we present an approach that uses techniques from network analysis to support organizations in processing and understanding this information. Central in our approach are network visualizations that help in comparing gaps between the aspired and current development levels of the processes of the member organizations. The advantage of our approach, which we validated via expert interviews, is that such visualizations are generated semi-automatically and offer an overall view of the current and aspired situation in the network without losing the ability to pinpoint particular, individual processes of interest.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - User Requirements Elicitation (URE) is a critical stage in the development of software systems. It is aimed at defining the information needs the system has to fulfill and the services it is expected to provide. The term “elicitation” points out the delicate role of the analyst, who has to take an active listening attitude in the dialogue with system stakeholders and intended users, being able to seek, uncover and elaborate requirements. The success of the process largely depends on the analyst’s communication skills and expertise, since URE is communicative, interdisciplinary and practical in nature. Despite a variety of techniques and approaches to URE are proposed, there is not at the moment a systematic training method. In the paper, a behavioral simulator reproducing a lifelike URE conversation is presented, which was developed exactly to train URE skills. The didactical idea backing the simulator is an interaction between user and game, based on a narrative and relational model developed by one of the leading companies in the field. The effectiveness of the simulator was verified through an experiment, whose design, implementation and results are described. The experiment intended to verify the internal validity, that is if users playing systematically with the simulator improved their performance with the simulator itself, as well as the external validity, that is if users also enhanced their URE skills. Results showed users’ improvements in both aspects.

AB  - Emotion processes are related to anxiety symptoms and disorders across the lifespan. This chapter uses emotional development as an explicit framework for understanding these associations, focusing mainly on child and adolescent populations. We begin by reviewing empirical studies of emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and associated constructs as they relate to clinically relevant anxiety. These emotion processes are then reviewed from the developmental literature, highlighting how individual differences in temperament and attachment may steer some children along trajectories of emotion development that put them at risk for anxiety. Factors that contextualize or provide mechanisms of the shift from typical development to clinically relevant anxiety outcomes include gender, attention biases and information processing, parenting, and culture. Finally, we review how emotion development has currently been incorporated into anxiety treatment and prevention. We offer suggestions for further incorporation of emotional development into the study of anxiety and the development of appropriate interventions.

SP  - 83
EP  - 99
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - There is a great deal of interest in characterizing the representations and processes that support visual word priming and written word identification more generally. On one view, these phenomena are supported by abstract orthographic representations that map together visually dissimilar exemplars of letters and words (e.g., the lettersA/a map onto a common abstract letter codea*). On a second view, orthographic codes consist in a collection of episodic representations of words that interact in such a way that it sometimes looksas if there are abstract codes. Tenpenny (1995) contrasted these general approaches and concluded by endorsing the episodic account, arguing that no evidence demands that we posit abstract orthographic representations. This review reconsiders the evidence and argues that a variety of priming and nonpriming research strongly supports the conclusion that abstract orthographic codes exist and support priming and word identification. On this account, episodic representations are represented separately from abstract orthographic knowledge and contribute minimally to these functions.

EP  - 342
VL  - 46
IS  - 2
AB  - As heavy media users, adolescents are frequently exposed to embedded advertising formats such as brand placements. Because this may lead to unwitting persuasion, regulations prescribe disclosure of brand placements. This study aimed to increase our understanding of the effects of disclosing television brand placements and disclosure duration on adolescents’ persuasion knowledge (i.e., recognition of brand placement as being advertising, understanding that brand placement has a persuasive intent and critical attitude toward brand placement) and brand responses (i.e., brand memory and brand attitude). To do so, an earlier study that was conducted among adults was replicated among adolescents aged 13–17 years (N = 221, 44 % female). The present study shows that brand placement disclosure had limited effects on adolescents’ persuasion knowledge as it only affected adolescents’ understanding of persuasive intent, did not mitigate persuasion, but did increase brand memory. These findings suggest that brand placement disclosure has fundamentally different effects on adolescents than on adults: the disclosures had less effects on activating persuasion knowledge and mitigating persuasion among adolescents than among adults. Implications for advertising disclosure regulation and consequences for advertisers are discussed.

JO  - Reading and Writing
SP  - 1
EP  - 25
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
AB  - Rapid serial naming tasks are frequently used to explain variance in reading skill. However, the construct being measured by rapid naming is yet undetermined. The Phonological Processing theory suggests that rapid naming relates to reading because of similar demands of access to long-term stored phonological representations of visual stimuli. Some researchers have argued that isolated or discrete-trial naming is a more precise measure of lexical access than serial naming, thus it is likely that any shared variance between these two formats can be attributed to similar lexical access demands. The present study examined whether there remained any variance in reading ability that could be uniquely explained by the rapid naming task while controlling for isolated naming. Structural equation modeling was used to examine these relations within the context of the phonological processing model. Results indicated that serial naming uniquely predicted reading, and the relation was stronger with isolated naming controlled for, suggesting that isolated naming functioned as a suppressor variable in the relation of serial naming with reading.

PB  - Birkhäuser Basel
CY  - Basel
AB  - Issues that are central to the modeling and analysis of a human movement system include (1) musculotendon dynamics, (2) the kinetics and kinematics of the biomechanical system, and (3) the relationship between neurological control and the formulation of the system as an open or closed loop process. This paper will address these problems in the context of two particular movement systems. The first to be addressed is the human ocular system. Eye movement systems are ideal for studying human control of movement since they are of relatively low dimension and easier to control than other neuromuscular systems. By scrutinizing the trajectories of eye movements it is possible to infer the effects of motoneuronal activity, deduce the central nervous system’s control strategy, and systematically observe the effects of perturbations in the controls. An application of the locomotory-control system will also be presented in this paper. In particular, a model of human gait is developed for the purpose of relating neural controls to the state of stress in a skeletal member. This is achieved by modeling the human body as an ensemble of articulating rigid-body segments controlled by a minimal muscle set. Neurological signals act as the input into the musculotendon dynamics and from the resulting muscular forces, the joint moments and resulting motion of the segmental model are derived.

SP  - 45

CY  - Cham
AB  - Previous studies have observed a tendency to associate the remnant (e.g., who) of ambiguous sluicing ellipsis with the closest/most local correlate (someone) in the matrix clause, as in Somebody said Fred fired someone, but I don’t know who. I present the results of three experiments investigating the interplay between locality and the discourse status of potential correlates. The studies exploit the discourse-linking property of which-phrases in ambiguous sluiced sentences, like A teacher scolded Max or Dotty, but I can’t remember which one, to explore whether the preference for more local correlates is modulated by the discourse status of the potential correlates. I propose a discourse economy constraint (Alternatives on Demand: Avoid positing new discourse alternatives without evidence), which interacts with structural constraints like locality. Evidence from several questionnaire studies, as well as three online self-paced reading studies, supports the predictions of a sentence processing model in which the discourse status of items in memory immediately impacts the retrieval of a correlate for the remnant of sluicing ellipsis and related constructions. In addition, the time point at which the interaction between processing biases appears is shown to depend on the strength or diagnosticity of the retrieval cues in which-phrase.

SP  - 125

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Our research is placed in the context of business decision making processes. We look at decision making as at a workflow of (mostly mental) activities directed at choosing one decision alternative. Our goal is to direct the flow of decision activities such that the relevant alternatives are properly evaluated. It is outside our purpose to recommend which alternative should be chosen. Since business decision making is data-centric, we use a Decision Data Model (DDM). It is automatically mined from a log containing the decision maker’s actions while interacting with business software. The recommendation is based on an aggregated DDM that shows what many decision makers have done in the same decision situation. In our previous work we created algorithms that seek a local optimum. In this paper we show how the recommendation based on DDM problem can be mapped to a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The aim is to use MDP to find a global optimal decision making strategy.

AB  - The adoption of consumer technology in organizations, termed as IT consumerization, alters the IT infrastructure of many organizations. Letting employees decide which IT tools to use for their work increases the complexity of the organizational IT landscape and immediately raises the question how to provide adequate support given the multitude of technologies. Bring-Your-Own-Device advocates argue that employees can provide IT support on their own. An established concept to provide user-to-user support are social questions & answers sites (SQA). While such community sites are perfectly suited for exploratory problem solving, they lack however suitability to help solving specific problems subject to a specific organization. Moreover, receiving fast ad-hoc help in SQA is rather unlikely, as communication is always indirect and experts to solve the problem are unknown beforehand. The work presented in this paper explores key design characteristics of SQA sites in organizations that overcome the shortcoming of public SQA sites. Based on existing IS literature, we identify four kernel theories that are relevant for SQA sites in organizations and derive meta-requirements from them. In a next step, we analyze five public SQA sites to identify common design principles of SQA sites that are already applied. The main part of our analysis matches the identified design principles with the formulated meta-requirements to address potential gaps with respect to an enterprise environment. We conclude our research with the suggestion of additional design principles for SQA sites that account for their application in an organizational context.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 923
EP  - 930
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - In several recent reviews, authors have argued for the pervasive use of fast-and-frugal heuristics in human judgment. They have provided an overview of heuristics and have reiterated findings corroborating that such heuristics can be very valid strategies leading to high accuracy. They also have reviewed previous work that implies that simple heuristics are actually used by decision makers. Unfortunately, concerning the latter point, these reviews appear to be somewhat incomplete. More important, previous conclusions have been derived from investigations that bear some noteworthy methodological limitations. I demonstrate these by proposing a new heuristic and provide some novel critical findings. Also, I review some of the relevant literature often not—or only partially—considered. Overall, although some fast-and-frugal heuristics indeed seem to predict behavior at times, there is little to no evidence for others. More generally, the empirical evidence available does not warrant the conclusion that heuristics are pervasively used.

In this book, Tukey lays out the foundation for leveraging visual tools to facilitate exploration and understanding of data and statistical models of data. As cognitive science moves toward establishing robust practices for modeling, building on the foundational recommendations by Lee et al. (Computational Brain and Behavior, 2019), I argue that we must make visualization one of our cornerstones.

AB  - Utilizing a helicopter simulator developed within the Institute of Flight Systems at the University of the Armed Forces Munich, this work investigates how human resource theory and real-time physiological monitoring might support an adaptive assistant system intended to provide mission-relevant support to a helicopter crew during simulated mission scenarios. This investigation is conducted through an analysis of a series of simulated missions flown by subjects of varying experience with the simulator. Across-subject analysis highlights the significant variability of subject physiological responses and perceived workload. Additionally, correlations between various biological signals and assessed and perceived workload are identified. Within-subject analysis illustrates the temporal characteristics of various biological signals in this environment and reveals evidences suggesting future modeling of perceived workload though biological signals and a task-based workload assessment are promising.

AB  - This chapter presents an overview of HCI in Brazil, from the academic and industrial perspectives. Initially, a brief description of the Brazilian demographics, economy and culture is presented to set the context to understanding HCI development and its characteristics in Brazil. This overview is followed by a retrospective of how the field started in Brazil and how the HCI community consolidated itself. The current status of HCI in Brazil is described through its education at the universities, the research developed in the country and how it is used in the industry. In order to describe how HCI is taught in Brazil, an exploratory research with professors was conducted and the results regarding the courses taught are presented. Next, an outline of Brazilian research interests is discussed, highlighting what we perceive as some of its most relevant contributions, namely, its research in semiotic approaches to HCI and digital inclusion. Finally, interviews with some of the leading usability professionals in the country allow us to describe the industrial activity in Brazil as a flourishing web-centered usability business that is pacing towards maturity.

TI  - Mimicry and Modeling of Health(-Risk) Behaviors: How Others Impact Our Health(-Risk) Behaviors Without Our Awareness
JO  - Journal of Nonverbal Behavior
AB  - When it comes to health(-risk) behaviors, researchers are apt to consider how to change behaviors from a top-down approach (i.e., using the conscious, reflective, deliberate system) even though much of human behavior is determined by bottom-up processes (i.e., the nonconscious, reflexive, impulsive system). Given that researchers have proposed that interventions that target nonconscious processes underlying health(-risk) behaviors may prove to be more effective than interventions that target conscious processes, we argue that understanding the ways in which mimicking and modeling affect health(-risk) behaviors is a critical—albeit largely unexplored—domain. In this paper, we review existing evidence that people mimic and model a broad range of health(-risk) behaviors: specifically, the cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, (un)healthy eating, and physical activity of others. We then discuss the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these effects. Next, we outline moderators: specifically, we discuss when mimicking and modeling are more likely to occur, who is more likely to mimic and model, as well as who is more likely to be mimicked and modeled. Finally, we consider how mimicry and modeling could be used to leverage healthy behavioral change.

VL  - 14

AB  - A novel theoretical approach to human category learning is proposed in which categories are represented as coordinated statistical models of the properties of the members. Key elements of the account are learning to recode inputs as task-constrained principle components and evaluating category membership in terms of model fit—that is, the fidelity of the reconstruction after recoding and decoding the stimulus. The approach is implemented as a computational model called DIVA (for DIVergent Autoencoder), an artificial neural network that uses reconstructive learning to solve N-way classification tasks. DIVA shows good qualitative fits to benchmark human learning data and provides a compelling theoretical alternative to established models.

BT  - Learning from Dynamic Visualization: Innovations in Research and Application
SP  - 5
EP  - 30
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The educational effectiveness of conventionally designed animations that portray complex, unfamiliar subject matter in a behaviorally realistic fashion too often falls well short of expectations. Previous research indicates that the veridical dynamic properties of these comprehensive animations make a major contribution to their lack of effectiveness. Due to these dynamics, there is a substantial mismatch between the processing demands these animations impose on learners and the characteristics of the human information processing system. As a result, the quality of the mental models that learners are able to construct is compromised. Interventions intended to improve learners’ processing of such animations have met with only limited success. This chapter argues that substantial gains in the educational effectiveness of animations will require a fundamental change in the assumptions underlying how they are designed. An alternative design approach based on the Animation Processing Model (APM) is outlined that aims to facilitate the learner’s composition of an internal representation by adopting a different perspective on the characteristics of the animation as an external representation. This Composition Approach presents learners with information in an incremental, cumulative manner that is better matched with their processing capacities. The practical application of this approach is illustrated and implications for future research are canvassed.

AB  - The foundations of organizations such as visions, mission statements, the organizational structure—and corporate strategies as well as strategic objectives derived from them—are the supporting pillars of the core business of the respective organization and they are part of the—in a wider meaning—infrastructure of the organization. These elements and structures influence the behavior of the organization and are part of the subconscious mind of the organization. The new technologies and tools like sensors, internet of things, augmented reality, social media, Big Data, etc. are attached and settled in this infrastructure—they are becoming part of it—and they change the perception of the organization. But they also change the possibilities for interaction both internally and externally. They change the “cognitive processes” of the organization and thus the subconscious mind of the organization. New concepts, such as social collaboration and realtime enterprise accelerate the interaction and business processes and open up new paradigms like the paradigm of sharing—the “shareconomy”. Decisions are increasingly being supported by IT (Decision Support) or even automated. Systems and algorithms with learning abilities and Artificial Intelligence emerge or are moving in. How can the organizational and entrepreneurial governance be secured in such disruptive phase shifts? How can the foundations and frameworks of the organization be kept appropriate and stable? How can the subconscious mind of the organization—required as a basis for the fast and efficient action—be formed and shaped in a safe way. How to make it “resilient”? This requires not only communication but also the right algorithms for the self-control of complex systems. However, organizations have to be designed and built so that they can deal with uncertainties and disruptions as best as possible. This requires an appropriate infrastructure—in a wider meaning—as important part of the subconscious mind of an organization and this requires the meaningful use of existing and expectable technologies.

TI  - Predicting instructed simulation and dissimulation when screening for depressive symptoms
JO  - European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience
AB  - The intentional distortion of test results presents a fundamental problem to self-report-based psychiatric assessment, such as screening for depressive symptoms. The first objective of the study was to clarify whether depressed patients like healthy controls possess both the cognitive ability and motivation to deliberately influence results of commonly used screening measures. The second objective was the construction of a method derived directly from within the test takers’ responses to systematically detect faking behavior. Supervised machine learning algorithms posit the potential to empirically learn the implicit interconnections between responses, which shape detectable faking patterns. In a standardized design, faking bad and faking good were experimentally induced in a matched sample of 150 depressed and 150 healthy subjects. Participants completed commonly used questionnaires to detect depressive and associated symptoms. Group differences throughout experimental conditions were evaluated using linear mixed-models. Machine learning algorithms were trained on the test results and compared regarding their capacity to systematically predict distortions in response behavior in two scenarios: (1) differentiation of authentic patient responses from simulated responses of healthy participants; (2) differentiation of authentic patient responses from dissimulated patient responses. Statistically significant convergence of the test scores in both faking conditions suggests that both depressive patients and healthy controls have the cognitive ability as well as the motivational compliance to alter their test results. Evaluation of the algorithmic capability to detect faking behavior yielded ideal predictive accuracies of up to 89%. Implications of the findings, as well as future research objectives are discussed. Trial Registration The study was pre-registered at the German registry for clinical trials (Deutsches Register klinischer Studien, DRKS; DRKS00007708).

AB  - Perhaps symbolic of some deep irony in the history of psychology, the death of William James in 1910 coincided with the dramatic emergence of behaviorism in American psychology and with the turn from sensitive introspection toward a kind of mindless but well-documented motor responsiveness that characterized behaviorism. The young psychologists who emerged during the next half-century, establishing their bastions and rat-laboratories in Indiana, Iowa, and dozens of the land-grant universities scattered over the face of America, had no patience with the quiet speculations about the self and consciousness of William James. Indeed, led by Watson, they mocked the dry efforts of Titchner and his students to separate out sensation, perception, and imagery in consciousness by introspecting about the degree of ”purpleness” of a light. American psychologists wanted facts, hard data, and precise methodologies that could lead to replicable experiments.

SP  - 293
EP  - 311
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
AB  - Given the factors such as safety, profitability, and environmental concerns at stake, operator training is an everlasting and vital process in the process industry. An inevitable need for skilled operators in the chemical industry leads to search for novel and effective training methodologies. Consequently, dynamic simulation techniques have been considered as a tool to educate and train inexperienced personnel as expected by the industry. Traditional training methodologies are hardly sufficient to instruct the operators for seldom-occurring perilous situations. Conventional operator training simulators (OTS) are generally effective, but they lack to give operators the actual feel of the scenarios. Training effectiveness can be enhanced by providing operators with a sense of realism. Therefore, integration of OTS with virtual reality (VR-OTS) certainly comes out to be an alternative. VR-OTS can replicate emergency conditions, accidents, and investigate safety protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for virtual reality (VR) in OTS, merits of VR-OTS, and the role of training assessment methods. Contributions of OTS Authors’ in process industry from year 2000 to mid-2017 are reviewed and discussed extensively. The review shows that VR-OTS provides tangible benefits over its conventional counterparts in terms of improved safety of plant, increased productivity, and environmental protection. Finally, this paper outlines future scopes that the current researcher may consider to focus for the increased and improved VR-OTS usage.

AB  - The field of Human Factors Engineering in the United States evolved out of demands from the increasing complexity of military weapon systems in World War II. The early workers in the field such as Paul Fitts in the Air Force, Adelbert Ford in the Navy and a little later John Weisz in the Army, were all trained as experimental psychologists, hence the methods applied during these years were transitioned almost directly out of empirical applied psychology. This was formally recognized in 1949 with one of the first published texts in the field (Chapanis et al., 1949).

AB  - Enhanced perception may allow for visual search superiority by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but does it occur over time? We tested high-functioning children with ASD, typically developing (TD) children, and TD adults in two tasks at three presentation rates (50, 83.3, and 116.7 ms/item) using rapid serial visual presentation. In the Color task, participants detected a purple target letter amongst black letter distractors. In the Category task, participants detected a letter amongst number distractors. Slower rates resulted in higher accuracy. Children with ASD were more accurate than TD children and similar to adults at the fastest rate when detecting color-marked targets, indicating atypical neurodevelopment in ASD may cause generalized perceptual enhancement relative to typically developing peers.

TI  - Leveraging Image-Processing Techniques for Empirical Research: Feasibility and Reliability in Online Shopping Context
JO  - Information Systems Frontiers
AB  - Photos play a critical role in online shopping. To examine their impact on consumers, most previous studies rely on human assessments to develop measures for photos. Such an approach limits the number of dimensions and samples that can be investigated in one study. This study exploits image-processing techniques to tackle this challenge. We develop a framework and differentiate two types of computer-generated measures, aggregative and decompositive measures, which may be used in different ways in empirical research. We review the major image-processing technologies that have potential to be used in consumer behavior research. To showcase the feasibility of the framework, we conduct an example study on product photos’ impact on consumer click-through. Moreover, we conduct a simulation to investigate the robustness of the framework under the attack of image-processing algorithm errors. We find that image-processing techniques with 90~95% accuracy will be sufficient for empirical research.

AB  - Before the increasing efforts for understanding, predicting, and enhancing students’ learning in educational settings, learning analytics (LA) emerges as a candidate research area to tackle such issues. Thus, several work lines have been conducted, as well as diverse conceptual and theoretical perspectives have been arisen. Moreover, quite interesting and useful outcomes have been produced during the LA short lifetime. However, a clear idea of diverse questions is still pending to be given. (e.g., what does learning analytics mean? what are its backgrounds, related domains, and underlying elements? which are the objects of its applications? and what about the trends and challenges to be considered?) This is the reason why the chapter aims at responding those concerns by a sketch of a conceptual scenery that explains the LA background, its underlying domains and nature, including a survey of recent and relevant approaches, and a relation of risks and opportunities.

AB  - Visual focus and mental focus in diagram-based problem solving have been shown to be often interrelated with respect to cognitive and visuo-perceptual representational and procedural properties. A problem solver’s visual focus can be used for a rough detection of mental focus in diagrammatic reasoning – sufficient to distinguish certain problem solving modes. An integration of visual focus over time can reveal characteristic patterns of problem solving strategies or solutions models. Such patterns hold formidable potential for computer-assisted and collaborative human-computer reasoning with diagrams.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The collection of behavior protocols is a common practice in human factors research, but the analysis of these large data sets has always been a tedious and time-consuming process. We are interested in automatically finding canonical behaviors: a small subset of behavioral protocols that is most representative of the full data set, providing a view of the data with as few protocols as possible. Behavior protocols often have a natural graph-based representation, yet there has been little work applying graph theory to their study. In this paper we extend our recent algorithm by taking into account the graph topology induced by the paths taken through the space of possible behaviors. We applied this technique to find canonical web-browsing behaviors for computer users. By comparing identified canonical sets to a ground truth determined by expert human coders, we found that this graph-based metric outperforms our previous metric based on edit distance.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Successful adoption and implementation of HIS has been the subject of extensive research as can be evidenced by the large body of research literature on this topic. However, the effect of fit-viability issues has been less widely studied, perhaps because of the difficulty and complexity of such sociotechnical studies. HIS implementation is multifaceted and involves people issues as well as technological issues. The effect of sociotechnical issues such as macro level or external factors including political, social, economic, environmental infrastructure, technology, and laws and regulations; meso level or organizational factors such as leadership, management style, policies, and structure; and micro level or tactical factors such as information sharing, training and learning, technical staff or user behaviour has been less widely studied. By drawing upon multiple streams of theory building, a framework, from the fit-viability model (FVM) perspective, is developed. The framework provides important and valuable guiding principles for organizations for their decisions on adoption and deployment of HIS. Grounded on the fit-viability framework, we proffer a unique application of the fit-viability model (FVM) to enable a better understanding of vital issues concerning the implementation and adoption of a point of care (PoC) system at one of the not-for-profit private organization in Australia. This will help the decision-makers in hospital to understand how the new system fits within the different specialties and also if it is a viable option to install such a new system. This study focuses on just two departments of the hospital, namely, Food Services and Environment Services. An exploratory single case qualitative study methodology is adopted. From such an analysis, it is conceivable to assert focal aspects with the PoC solution and opportunities to add value.

AB  - Emergence of the Internet and widespread use of mobile computing have brought traditional eHealth beyond the boundary of the clinical setting, evolving to mHealth which is patient-centered and ubiquitous. Faced with the world’s rapidly ageing population and its burden on the healthcare system, one of the intense areas of development in mHealth is continuous patient monitoring. It requires careful integration of wearable sensors and wireless body sensor networks. Unlike traditional ambulatory monitors, sensors for mHealth may appear in various forms, such as watches, jewelry, eyewear, and even smart garments. Recent work have focused on design for wearability, alternative sensing techniques, and mHealth-specific network topologies.

AB  - Behavioral research in information systems employing quantitative methods has traditionally relied on mainly survey-based approaches to gather subjective user data. With new advances in technology such as mobile computing, wearable devices, and social media, along with computational capabilities, organizations are in a position to leverage objective data in addressing IT issues typically addressed in behavioral research. In this paper, we propose a framework for envisioning how data analytics may be leveraged in conducting behavioral research. Particularly, the framework is explained using examples from extant research along two broad avenues, namely ‘data analytics for data generation’ and ‘data analytics for model generation.’ The article also serves as an introduction to the special issue of the Information Systems Frontiers (ISF) journal on the topic of ‘Data Analytics in Behavioral Research.’

AB  - Negative symptoms have long been considered a core domain of psychopathology in schizophrenia. There has been increased interest in determining the etiology of negative symptoms given that they are largely resistant to current treatment approaches. Limited progress in the treatment of negative symptoms may be due in part to having conceptualized the construct as a singular dimension with common etiology. However, there is now consistent evidence that negative symptoms can be divided into two dimensions of pathology, one reflecting reduced approach motivation and the other diminished expressivity. Although both dimensions are critically important treatment targets, increased severity of volitional symptoms has generally been associated with poorer outcomes. By gaining a better understanding of the etiology of volitional pathology, the field may be better positioned to develop more precise treatments that directly target the most relevant cognitive and neural mechanisms. In the current document, we review the literature on the etiology of the volitional dimension of negative symptoms through the lens of recent theoretical frameworks developed in the fields of cognitive and affective neuroscience. New evidence is presented indicating that schizophrenia patients display deficits in hedonic experience, but that these only emerge at lower levels of motivational significance. We also summarize evidence indicating that greater severity of volitional pathology is associated with dysfunctional corticostriatal interactions and impairments in several aspects of reward processing (e.g., reinforcement learning, value representation, effort-cost computation, uncertainty-driven exploration, and action selection) and emotion processing (e.g., emotion-attention interactions, emotional memory). A new theoretical model is proposed that builds upon recent models of negative symptoms and incorporates hedonic abnormalities, reward processing deficits, and dysfunctional cognition-emotion interactions into decision-making processes. Several promising directions for future research and treatment are also discussed in relation to this new theoretical formulation.

Privacy policies help to inform the user about his/her rights and to protect the user’s privacy. In this paper we present a test to empirically measure how the user’s privacy awareness changes by presenting specific elements of the privacy policy in close proximity to the required data items. We compare an experimental group using an enhanced interface to a control group using a conventional interface regarding their capability to recall the agreed privacy-related facts. A concrete online survey has been performed. The major results are presented.

AB  - In ATM (Air Traffic Management), traffic and environment are not important by themselves. The most important factor is the cognitive work performed by the air traffic controller (ATCo). As detailed mental pictures can overcome ATCo’s limited attentional resources (causing Mental Overload), she/he can use internal strategies called abstractions to mitigate the cognitive complexity of the control task. This paper gathers the modelling, automation and preliminary calibration of the Cognitive Complexity concept. The primary purpose of this model is to support the ATM planning roles to detect imbalances and make decisions regarding the best DCB (Demand and Capacity Balancing) measures to resolve hotspots. The four parameters selected that provide meaningful operational information to mitigate cognitive complexity are Standard Flow Interactions, Flights out of Standard Flows, Potential Crossings and Flights in Evolution. The model has been integrated into a DCB prototype within the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) 2020 Wave 1 during Real Time Simulations.

JO  - Vocations and Learning
SP  - 133
EP  - 159
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - This article deals with a theory-based investigation of the diagnostic problem-solving process in professional contexts. To begin with, a theory of the diagnostic problem-solving process was developed drawing on findings from different professional contexts. The theory distinguishes between four sub-processes of the diagnostic problem-solving process and includes several hypotheses. According to the theory, the quality of the sub-processes “representing information” and “testing hypotheses” causally influences the diagnostic problem-solving success. Additionally, the theory suggests that the influence of “testing hypotheses” on the problem-solving success is higher than the influence of “representing information”. Moreover, the theory assumes that the influence of the quality of “representing information” on the success is mediated by the quality of “testing hypotheses”. These hypotheses were examined in the context of car mechatronics using diagnostic problems of the car sector, a computer-based assessment and a sample of car mechatronic apprentices (N = 339). To operationalize the sub-processes’ quality, observable critical behavior was theoretically identified and extracted from computer-generated log-files. The empirical results were largely in line with the hypotheses and indicated a (very) first corroboration of the theory in the context of car mechatronics. The theory could be helpful to investigate and teach diagnostic problem solving in different professional contexts. Further studies, however, should scrutinize whether the theory applies to other studies and professional contexts.

Maintaining the common ground requires domain knowledge but has also numerous social aspects, such as attention, engagement and empathy. Integrating these aspects and their interplay with the dialog management in a computational interaction model is a complex task. We present a modeling approach overcoming this challenge and illustrate it based on some social companion applications.

AB  - Digitization has affected almost every industry during the past decade. The unprecedented pace at which digital technologies spread and penetrate society, individual life, and businesses specifically puts mature companies at risk. Within the automotive industry, digitization brings new players to the table, shifts the technological focus from physical to IT, enables customers to bring in their changing understanding of mobility, and makes them an ever more valuable source of information. Moreover, digitization affects the value creation process and emphasizes the importance of multilateral cross-company cooperations. This is also highlighted by the fact that most automotive companies currently lack the necessary competences to succeed in an increasingly software- and IT-dominated environment. The companies BMW, Porsche, and Tesla serve as examples for how car manufacturers deal with the digitization challenge and how they adapt their technological and service portfolio accordingly. We seek to enrich the understanding of how the rise of digital and networked technologies affects the business and business models of car manufacturers and provide suggestions on how they should react to turn these disruptive forces into business advantage. In this context we take a look at how automotive OEMs can integrate themselves into digital business models and mobility concepts of the future.

JO  - Current Psychology
SP  - 75

VL  - 38
IS  - 1
AB  - Literature on fear-arousing communications has led to divergent conclusions. On the one hand, studies have shown that fear increases attitude change via systematic processing. On the other hand, it has been observed that arousing fear provokes defense-motivated reactions. Nevertheless, few studies have embedded measures of persuasion, information processing, and defensiveness all at once. Consequently, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of fear-arousal on these three outcomes in order to clarify this ambiguous issue. The participants were instructed to watch a public service announcement video with two conditions of fear. Our results showed that an increase of fear generated a more positive attitude, as well as systematic processing but, surprisingly, more defensive reactions. Further analyses revealed a mediating effect of these reactions between fear and attitude. These results suggest an alternative pathway to understand the effects of fear-appeals, emphasizing the positive influence of defensive responses.

SP  - 145
EP  - 165
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Research on framing effects has been one of few multidisciplinary endeavors joined by psychologists, economists, political scientists, and management and marketing researchers. Framing effects epitomize the power of linguistic subtlety in regulating decision-making, showing that different ways of framing, phrasing, or presenting virtually identical choice options systematically affect risk preference, evaluation of experience, and persuasiveness of messages. Given its central role in the studies of decision biases, the framing effect has been used as an experimental probe for understanding general mechanisms of human judgment and decision-making. Researchers have proposed various models explaining the framing effect. However, it was not until recently that research of framing effects started to focus more on psychological mechanisms above and beyond phenomenology. We conducted a meta-analysis of neural correlates of framing effects. The topographic convergences from a total of 26 foci found in the fMRI studies of framing effects revealed two key brain areas underlying framing effects: the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Together with behavioral findings, these results suggest that valence framing as a secondary cue becomes most salient and effective when primary contextual or social cues are absent or incongruent. The processing of choice problems under these conditions call for an ambiguity-reducing and conflict-monitoring function, which would result in the ACC activation. Second, the right IFG activation suggests that the nature of valence framing is both semantic and hedonic, involving not only verbatim linguistic analysis, but also interpretation of its affective tones and metaphorical implications.

AB  - In computer science, the concept of user experience has proven to be beneficial in order to improve the quality of interaction between software and its users, by taking users’ emotions and attitudes into account. In general, user experience focuses on interaction. As not only interaction (e.g., good usability) is of importance for players, this chapter discusses how the concept of user experience can not only be applied to serious games, but also how it can be extended in order to cover the characteristics of games as a special software. For this refined concept, the term player experience has been coined. First, the concept of player experience is introduced in this chapter. The adequate conceptualization of player experience requires differentiating specific dimensions like (game-) flow, immersion, challenge, tension, competence, and emotions. Because of the individual nature of player experience, psychological models need to be used for the conceptualization as they are able to reflect this multidimensional structure. In addition, interdisciplinary models are needed in order to address the various factors influencing player experience. This ensures a holistic approach. Second, the question how to measure player experience is discussed. Here, different levels have to be distinguished: Behavior, physiological reactions, and subjective experience. Finally, it is shown how knowledge about player experience can be employed to develop serious games systematically and to improve their quality.

SP  - 445
EP  - 460
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This article examines the influence of mood feedback on different outcomes of teamwork in two different collaborative work environments. Employing a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, mood feedback (present vs. not present) and communication mode (face-to-face vs. video conferencing) were manipulated experimentally. We used a newly developed collaborative communication environment, called EmotiBoard, which is a large vertical interactive screen, with which team members can interact in a face-to-face discussion or as a spatially distributed team. To support teamwork, this tool provides visual feedback of each team member’s emotional state. Thirty-five teams comprising 3 persons each (with a confederate in each team) completed three different tasks, measuring mood, performance, subjective workload, and team satisfaction. Results indicated that the evaluation of the other team members’ emotional state was more accurate when the mood feedback was presented. In addition, mood feedback influenced team performance positively in the video conference condition and negatively in the face-to-face condition. Furthermore, participants in the video conference condition were more satisfied after task completion than participants in the face-to-face condition. Findings indicate that the mood feedback tool is helpful for teams to gain a more accurate understanding of team members’ emotional states in different work situations.

SP  - 271
EP  - 289
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Consumer search behaviour is a central process in the functioning of markets because it determines how customers find and evaluate information about competing suppliers and therefore determines to a large extent buying behaviour. A review of the empirical evidence of search behaviour based on the theoretical constructs of consideration set and time is used as the basis for evaluating competing theories from Information Systems, economics, decision-making theory and marketing that seek to explain and predict consumer search patterns. A multi-disciplinary bricolage search model is proposed that incorporates elements from previous theories but differs from established theory by acknowledging that search may best be described as rummaging to build an information mosaic and therefore appears more random than was previously thought. A bricolage model may help explain a range of different search behaviours, for example iterative and sometimes seemingly chaotic search patterns, narrow search behaviour, haphazard search behaviour, heuristic approaches and relatively small amounts of attention paid on evaluating different options. The theoretical and managerial implications of the ideas are outlined, which indicate areas for further research.

The model incorporates ontologies, knowledge and dynamic models from human-directed sciences such as psychology, social science, neuroscience and biomedical sciences. The model has been formally specified, and it is shown how for specific applications it can be instantiated by application-specific elements, thus providing an executable specification that can be used for prototyping. Moreover, it is shown how dynamic properties can be formally specified and verified against generated traces.

AB  - This paper examines the way in which brand positioning elements are manifested in the business-to-business (B2B) online environment. The case of the UK print industry is presented, investigating the use of brand positioning elements through the examination of corporate web pages of 30 UK print suppliers. A framework is developed to show how brand positioning is operationalised in the online environment. The paper concludes by giving recommendations about how the framework can be used by practitioners in order to reconcile their online and offline branding activities. The framework may also be useful for academics to undertake empirical research.

BT  - The Semantics of Gradability, Vagueness, and Scale Structure: Experimental Perspectives
SP  - 243
EP  - 273
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Recent proposals in the semantics literature hold that the negative comparative less and negative adjectives like short in English are morphosyntactically complex, unlike their positive counterparts more and tall. For instance, the negative adjective short might decompose into little tall (Rullmann, Dissertation, 1995; Heim, Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory, vol. 16, 2006, Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung, vol. 12, 2008; Büring, Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory, vol. 17, 2007). Positing a silent little as part of adjectives like short correctly predicts that they are semantically opposite to tall; we seek evidence for this decomposition in language understanding in English and Polish. Our visual verification tasks compare processing of positive and negative comparatives with taller and shorter against that of less symbolically-rich mathematical statements, $$A > B$$A>B, $$B < A$$B<A. We find that both language and math statements generally lead to monotonic increases in processing load along with the number of negative symbols (as predicted for language by e.g. Clark and Chase, Cognitive Psychology, 3:472–517, 1972). Our study is the first to examine the processing of the gradable predicates tall and short cross-linguistically, as well as in contrast to extensionally-equivalent, and putatively non-linguistic stimuli (cf. Deschamps et al, Cognition, 143:115–128, 2015 with quantificational determiners).

JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 77
EP  - 89
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - Distributed collaborations between two or more participants on a task involving tangible artifacts (e.g., a machine, a patient, a tool) have become increasingly common in recent years due to rapid development in information and communication technologies. In this paper we focus on a specific type of remote-collaboration system where a remote helper guides a local worker using audio communication and hand gestures to perform a repair or a maintenance task. An established ICT approach to supporting this type of collaboration is to provide a shared visual space and some forms of remote gesture. The shared space typically consists of a video capture of the remote workspace which is then displayed on a 2D screen. However, this type of approach has its limitations. Firstly, it does not provide the helper with sufficient understanding of the spatial relationships between objects in the remote workspace. Secondly, it does not allow the helper to gesture in 3D. In an attempt to address these issues, we propose a Mixed Reality multimodal system that improves on previous 2D systems by introducing 3D real-time capturing and rendering of both the remote workspace and the helping hands and by creating a 3D shared visual space as a result of co-locating the remote workspace with the helping hands. In this system, we explore the possibility of increasing the feeling of immersion and co-presence by using head tracking, stereoscopic rendering, inter-occlusion handling and virtual shadowing. In this paper, we introduce HandsIn3D, a system that has been developed for the purpose of the proof of concept. We also present the results of experiments to verify the feasibility of our approach.

SP  - 75
EP  - 88
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The aesthetic experience with visual art has been shown to occur in two stages. Upon initial exposure to a painting, a viewer spontaneously generates a global impression, or gist, of the work. One’s first impression of a painting includes a sense of its pictorial content, overall structural organization and style, meaningfulness, and an affective reaction to it. When gist information in a painting is deemed to have sufficient interest to an observer, the second stage of aesthetic processing ensues. This consists of directed focal exploration of the image to expand knowledge concerning the work’s compositional features and organization to satisfy cognitive curiosity and to develop aesthetic appreciation of a composition. This chapter presents an overview of research findings that have identified the types of visual properties and semantically related information that collectively lead to the activation of what is labeled a “painting gist” by this author. In addition, the influence of the painting gist response on the focal exploration of paintings is discussed.

AB  - The interplay between games, assessment, and learning has so far been considered primarily within a formative setting and with particular focus on how design frameworks from these fields are connected and disconnected. The purpose of this chapter is to extend what has been developed and learned about formative game-based assessments (GBAs) into summative assessment practices. The objective is to answer questions about design principles, good or best practices, and application opportunities for summative game-based assessments, including a critical analysis of how they can or cannot improve summative assessment practices more generally. After introducing some foundations, we will discuss motivations for GBA, provide design trade-offs for various use cases, and develop considerations for designing summative GBAs. Careful review shows that this is a very challenging space with some limited, though worthwhile opportunities.

JO  - Cognitive Neurodynamics
SP  - 297
EP  - 316
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Syntactic theory provides a rich array of representational assumptions about linguistic knowledge and processes. Such detailed and independently motivated constraints on grammatical knowledge ought to play a role in sentence comprehension. However most grammar-based explanations of processing difficulty in the literature have attempted to use grammatical representations and processes per se to explain processing difficulty. They did not take into account that the description of higher cognition in mind and brain encompasses two levels: on the one hand, at the macrolevel, symbolic computation is performed, and on the other hand, at the microlevel, computation is achieved through processes within a dynamical system. One critical question is therefore how linguistic theory and dynamical systems can be unified to provide an explanation for processing effects. Here, we present such a unification for a particular account to syntactic theory: namely a parser for Stabler’s Minimalist Grammars, in the framework of Smolensky’s Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic architectures. In simulations we demonstrate that the connectionist minimalist parser produces predictions which mirror global empirical findings from psycholinguistic research.

AB  - Personalization and adaptivity can promote motivated usage, increased user acceptance, and user identification in serious games. This applies to heterogeneous user groups in particular, since they can benefit from customized experiences that respond to the individual traits of the players. In the context of games, adaptivity describes the automatic adaptation of game elements, i.e., of content, user interfaces, game mechanics, game difficulty, etc., to customize or personalize the interactive experience. Adaptation processes follow an adaptive cycle, changing a deployed system to the needs of its users. They can work with various techniques ranging from simple threshold-based parameter adjustment heuristics to complex evolving user models that are continuously updated over time. This chapter provides readers with an understanding of the motivation behind using adaptive techniques in serious games and presents the core challenges around designing and implementing such systems. Examples of how adaptability and adaptivity may be put into practice in specific application scenarios, such as motion-based games for health, or personalized learning games, are presented to illustrate approaches to the aforementioned challenges. We close with a discussion of the major open questions and avenues for future work.

JO  - Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science
SP  - 574
EP  - 594
VL  - 47
IS  - 4
AB  - As mobile phones continue to rapidly expand around the world, marketers are seeking to better understand the impact these devices have on consumer outcomes. One common but understudied area is how mobile phones may influence in-store behaviors. Although prior research has investigated the many shopping related activities consumers undertake on their phones, it is still estimated that nearly half of all in-store mobile phone use is unrelated to the shopping task. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of shopping-unrelated mobile phone use, a frequent but understudied phenomenon, on consumers’ ability to accurately manage in-store shopping plans. Using both field and experimental data, we demonstrate that shopping-unrelated mobile phone use negatively affects consumers’ ability to accurately carry out in-store shopping plans and is associated with an increase in unplanned purchasing. Furthermore, we find that consumers who are highly dependent upon mobile phones tend to be the most at risk of deviating from a shopping plan while engaging in shopping-unrelated mobile phone use.

AB  - This review of several topics related to “stimulus overselectivity” (Lovaas et al., J Abnormal Psychol 77:211–222, 1971) has three main purposes: (1) To outline the factors that may contribute to overselectivity; (2) to link the behavior-analytical notion of overselectivity to current nonbehavior-analytical research and theory; and (3) to suggest remedial strategies based on the behavior-analytical approach. While it is clear that overselectivity is not specific to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also that not all persons with ASD exhibit overselectivity, it is prevalent in ASD and has critical implications for symptoms, treatment, research, and theory. Weak Central Coherence and Enhanced Perceptual Functioning theories are briefly considered. The research areas addressed here include theory of mind, joint attention, language development, and executive function.

VL  - 41
IS  - 2
AB  - Recent studies have begun to document the diversity of ways people regulate their emotions. However, one unanswered question is why people regulate their emotions as they do in everyday life. In the present research, we examined how social context and goals influence strategy selection in daily high points and low points. As expected, suppression was particularly tied to social features of context: it was used more when others were present, especially non-close partners, and when people had instrumental goals, especially more interpersonal ones (e.g., avoid conflict). Distraction and reappraisal were used more when regulating for hedonic reasons (e.g., to feel better), but these strategies were also linked to certain instrumental goals (e.g., getting work done). When contra-hedonic regulation occurred, it primarily took the form of dampening positive emotion during high points. Suppression was more likely to be used for contra-hedonic regulation, whereas reappraisal and distraction were used more for pro-hedonic regulation. Overall, these findings highlight the social nature of emotion regulation and underscore the importance of examining regulation in both positive and negative contexts.

AB  - Driving is a complex task of strategic decision making, maneuvering and controlling the vehicle while responding to external stimuli, traffic laws, and imminent hazards. Driver’s cognitive perception and reaction, physiological, and psychological capabilities along with experience, age, and many other factors play a major role in shaping the driving behavior and the skills to control the vehicle. Driver assistance systems are designed to support the driver in performing the primary driving tasks and the secondary in-vehicle tasks that may be required (operating radio, etc.). The goal of driver assistance or ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) is to enhance safety, comfort, and efficiency of driving by intervening in the handling aspects of the vehicle and supporting the secondary tasks for comfort, navigation, etc. Driver assistance deals with the environment in terms of sensing and responding, the vehicle in terms of sensing and actuating electromechanical systems, and most importantly the driver in terms of augmenting information, enhancing sensing capabilities, and assisting in control functions. This chapter examines various aspects of driver assistance system including driver cognitive perception–response, system types and classifications, integrated safety, man–machine interface, and evaluation of effectiveness. This chapter concludes with listing existing ADAS and research needs.

EP  - 270
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - A scientific problem solving environment should be built in such a way that users (scientists) might exploit underlying technologies without a specialised knowledge about available tools and resources. An adaptive user interface can be considered as an opportunity in addressing this challenge. This paper explores the importance of individual human abilities in the design of adaptive user interfaces for scientific problem solving environments. In total, seven human factors (gender, learning abilities, locus of control, attention focus, cognitive strategy and verbal and nonverbal IQs) have been evaluated regarding their impact on interface adjustments done manually by users. People’s preferences for different interface configurations have been investigated. The experimental study suggests criteria for the inclusion of human factors into the user model guiding and controlling the adaptation process.

AB  - A reusable agent-based generic model is presented for a specific class of Ambient Intelligence pplications: those cases addressing human wellbeing and functioning from a human-like understanding. The model incorporates ontologies, knowledge and dynamic models from human-directed sciences such as psychology, social science, neuroscience and biomedical sciences. The model has been formally specified, and it is shown how for specific applications it can be instantiated by applicationspecific elements, thus providing an executable specification that can be used for prototyping. Moreover, it is shown how dynamic properties can be formally specified and verified against generated traces.

AB  - We present results from two experiments intended to allow naturalistic data collection of the physiological effects of cognitive load. Considering the example of command and control environments, we identify shortcomings of previous studies which use either laboratory-based scenarios, lacking realism, or real-world scenarios, lacking repeatability. We identify the hybrid approach of remote-control which allows experimental subjects to remain in a laboratory setting, performing a real-world task in a completely controlled environment. We show that emotional investment is vital for evoking natural responses and that physiological indications of cognitive load manifest themselves more readily in our hybrid experimental setup. Finally, we present a set of experimental design recommendations for naturalistic data collection.

TI  - How to model the neurocognitive dynamics of decision making: A methodological primer with ACT-R
JO  - Behavior Research Methods
AB  - Higher cognitive functions are the product of a dynamic interplay of perceptual, mnemonic, and other cognitive processes. Modeling the interplay of these processes and generating predictions about both behavioral and neural data can be achieved with cognitive architectures. However, such architectures are still used relatively rarely, likely because working with them comes with high entry-level barriers. To lower these barriers, we provide a methodological primer for modeling higher cognitive functions and their constituent cognitive subprocesses with arguably the most developed cognitive architecture today—ACT-R. We showcase a principled method of generating individual response time predictions, and demonstrate how neural data can be used to refine ACT-R models. To illustrate our approach, we develop a fully specified neurocognitive model of a prominent strategy for memory-based decisions—the take-the-best heuristic—modeling decision making as a dynamic interplay of perceptual, motor, and memory processes. This implementation allows us to predict the dynamics of behavior and the temporal and spatial patterns of brain activity. Moreover, we show that comparing the predictions for brain activity to empirical BOLD data allows us to differentiate competing ACT-R implementations of take the best.

BT  - International Handbook of Metacognition and Learning Technologies
SP  - 243
EP  - 260
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - This chapter summarizes the rationale and findings of several studies using rich open-ended web-based learning environments (Web-LEs) as learning technology in higher education. The purpose of the studies was to examine self-regulated learning activities by tracing university students’ learning activities within a rich open-ended Web-LE by log file data. Hence, the Web-LEs used in these studies provided non-embedded as well as embedded tools supporting cognitive as well as metacognitive learning activities. Students in all studies were free to decide when and how to use these tools. To use them, they had to activate the selected tool explicitly by clicking on the respective button on the Web-LEs’ interface. The rationale for the design of the Web-LEs and for analyzing and interpreting the log file data was derived from psychological task analyses which were based on a multidimensional view of self-regulated learning within Web-LEs (e.g., Narciss et al., 2007; Winter, 2008). This chapter outlines this rationale, describes the resources and tools of the rich Web-LE called Study Desk, and summarizes several studies investigating how students used the tools of the Study Desks. Finally, limitations, challenges and implications of using log file data for investigating self-regulated learning with rich Web-LEs are discussed.

AB  - Managing the new product development (NPD) is a challenging mission, and most researches would argue that design is fundamentally linked to intentional action and it cannot emerge out of complexity. In fact, its complexity is generated by a large number of entities and actors which cooperate simultaneously with an unpredictable way to understand what customers want and then design product with diverse objectives in mind. A slight change in one activity may cause tremors everywhere. Within a dynamic environment and in order to meet concurrently these challenges, several researchers have implemented design for X (DFX) techniques. Regarding the availability of numerous DFX, the decision as to which one to apply remains absent. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the most prominent DFX techniques with respect to sustainability dimension as well as the cost ownership and product differentiation strategies. In addition to that, complex product necessitates the consideration of integrated DFX to optimize product life cycle from a more holistic perspective. In this respect, the paper addresses a systematic review from 1980 to 2018 by investigating and discussing the past and current research of each DFX techniques as well as for integrated ones. The key problems and issues that future DFX research should address have been identified and discussed in this paper.

VL  - 26
IS  - 2
AB  - The current study examined the relationships between learners’ ($$N = 123$$N=123) personality traits, the emotions they typically experience while studying (trait studying emotions), and the emotions they reported experiencing as a result of interacting with four pedagogical agents (agent-directed emotions) in MetaTutor, an advanced multi-agent learning environment. Overall, significant relationships between a subset of trait emotions (trait anger, trait anxiety) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) were found for four agent-directed emotions (enjoyment, pride, boredom, and neutral) though the relationships differed between pedagogical agents. These results demonstrate that some trait emotions and personality traits can be used to predict learners’ emotions directed toward specific pedagogical agents (with different roles). Results provide suggestions for adapting pedagogical agents to support learners’ (with certain characteristics; e.g., high in neuroticism or agreeableness) experience of adaptive emotions (e.g., enjoyment) and minimize their experience on non-adaptive emotions (e.g., boredom). Such an approach presents a scalable and easily implementable method for creating emotionally-adaptive, agent-based learning environments, and improving learner-pedagogical agent interactions in order to support learning.

AB  - Advances in computer science and technology have led to unprecedented new possibilities in science, engineering, and business. At the same time, the automation of measurements, the networking of sensors, the digitization of processes, and large-scale computer simulations produce a deluge of data. The amount of new data grows faster than our ability to analyze and comprehend it. The maturing field of interactive visualization provides a new generation of tools and techniques that promise to contribute to a solution of this problem. In this chapter we present a survey of the field. The two complementary aspects of scientific visualization and information visualization are introduced, and a description of typical applications and research directions provided. The survey is rounded off by a look at the activities in the various fields of interactive visualization in Switzerland.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - We are witnessing a growing aging population who wishes to live independently. In a driving context, the elderly want to maintain an active lifestyle, but they may suffer from impairments due to aging. New intelligent transportation systems can be beneficial for drivers to assist them with driving. Hence, new intelligent technologies have to be accepted and have to persuade the driver of adopting safer driving behaviours. In this paper, we present a persuasive driving feedback for elderly drivers. The feedback objectives are to evaluate the drivers’ perception of the driving fatigue and to compare it with their driving behaviour. Our first results from an exploratory field experiment with twenty elderly drivers support the use of the feedback with that category of drivers relative to fatigue perception. The originality of this paper is to enable progress in the area of persuasive technologies applied to road safety and for elder people.

AB  - Increasingly, production processes are enabled and controlled by Information Technology (IT), a development being also referred to as “Industry 4.0”. IT thereby contributes to flexible and adaptive production processes, and in this sense factories become “smart factories”. In line with this, IT also more and more supports human workers via various assistance systems. This support aims to both support workers to better execute their tasks and to reduce the effort and time required when working. However, due to the large spectrum of assistance systems, it is hard to acquire an overview and to select an adequate system for a smart factory based on meaningful criteria. We therefore synthesize a set of comparison criteria into a consistent framework and demonstrate the application of our framework by classifying three examples.

AB  - “Transcoding for Web accessibility” is a category of technologies to transform inaccessible web content into accessible content on the fly. It was invented to help people with disabilities access inaccessible web pages without asking the content authors to modify their pages. It does this by converting the content on the fly in an intermediary server between the web server and the web browser. The technology has matured along with voice browsing technology from circa 1992 and was actively used in the 2000s. In this chapter, we will first cover the history of the transcoding technologies, and then introduce technical details of these transcoding systems. Finally, we discuss future directions and technical problems.

CY  - Cham
AB  - The challenge of big data era to the operation and management of financial products boil down to how to turn data operation capacity into the core competitiveness. Under the existing operation and management model of financial products, the unity between the efficiency and benefits of operating activities can be hardly achieved in big data era. Kansei engineering technology is targeted at better coordinating the relationship between consumers and products and providing a solution to the contradiction between the width and precision of big data information while conveying the usage requirements of products. This paper takes the lead in applying the Kansei engineering thoughts in non-industrial fields to the optimization of financial products operation. It proposes the concept of Kansei operation by analyzing the product lifecycle management of financial products, which is of prime importance to correctly process the structured and semi-structured Kansei information, reduce data mixture and achieve operational excellence. With the differential customer perceptual analysis as the research basis, this concept applies the conversion of sentimental demand quantification into real values to the optimization of financial products operation, thus putting into use the operational excellence in the big data era.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Information, as a human and social phenomenon, is the object of study of an emergent scientific field named Information Science (IS), which we put forward as unitary and transdisciplinary and open to a rich interdisciplinarity with other fields of knowledge. In face of the new reality, baptized the ‘Information Society’, and the emergence of a new paradigm, that we name “post-custodial, scientific and informational”, as opposed to the previous one, “historicist, custodial and technicist”, it is urgent to consolidate the theoretical and methodological foundations of IS in order to develop research, both pure and applied, and to contribute to a definition of its boundaries as a scientific area, in the scope of Social Sciences. Starting from an operative definition of Information, this paper aims to discuss the cognitive and emotional dimension of the info-communicational phenomenon and, for that, it is crucial to start a profound and hard dialogue with Cognitive Sciences. The label of ‘cognitivist’ given, in IS literature, to some authors like Bertram Brookes, because of the emphasis he put on the passage from a state of knowledge to a new state through an addition of knowledge coming from an increase of information, sounds quite equivocal, because knowledge and cognition are not synonymous and cognitive and emotional activity is not reducible to formalities. It is necessary to compare concepts and to understand the neuropsychological roots of the production, the organization and the info-communicational behaviour, so the contribution of Neurosciences and Cognitive Sciences, namely Cognitive Psychology, is indispensable.

AB  - The current study was undertaken to inform the development of simulations for improving train driver’s decision making under degraded track conditions. Trains are sophisticated heavy machinery and their performance is ever increasing resulting in the driving task becoming more complex and progressively dominated by cognitive and perceptual skills. A critical part of reducing the potential for train driver error and of increasing performance lies in the appropriate design of simulation training. In the current study a cognitive task analysis, using the critical decision method (CDM) was undertaken using a focus group research design. The process resulted in increased knowledge of expert train driver decision-making processes. Across four major incidents analyzed 11 decision points, 17 cues, 30 essential responsive actions and 45 possible errors where identified. The use of these results for supporting the design of simulation training and associated performance measures is discussed.

JO  - Archives of Sexual Behavior
SP  - 891
EP  - 905
VL  - 41
IS  - 4
AB  - Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most common sexual problem in women. From an incentive motivation perspective, HSDD may be the result of a weak association between sexual stimuli and rewarding experiences. As a consequence, these stimuli may either lose or fail to acquire a positive meaning, resulting in a limited number of incentives that have the capacity to elicit a sexual response. According to current information processing models of sexual arousal, sexual stimuli automatically activate meanings and if these are not predominantly positive, processes relevant to the activation of sexual arousal and desire may be interrupted. Premenopausal U.S. and Dutch women with acquired HSDD (n = 42) and a control group of sexually functional women (n = 42) completed a single target Implicit Association Task and a Picture Association Task assessing automatic affective associations with sexual stimuli and a dot detection task measuring attentional capture by sexual stimuli. Results showed that women with acquired HSDD displayed less positive (but not more negative) automatic associations with sexual stimuli than sexually functional women. The same pattern was found for self-reported affective sex-related associations. Participants were slower to detect targets in the dot detection task that replaced sexual images, irrespective of sexual function status. As such, the findings point to the relevance of affective processing of sexual stimuli in women with HSDD, and imply that the treatment of HSDD might benefit from a stronger emphasis on the strengthening of the association between sexual stimuli and positive meaning and sexual reward.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We present a novel method for deriving solution strategies used when solving rotation tasks. Process-based findings about physical rotation are obtained from an analysis of how angular disparity between stimuli changes over time. Data on angular disparity was gathered through a study on mental and physical rotation with 37 primary school students between the ages of 8 and 11. For controlling physical rotation, students used touch-based input on our iOS app Rotate it!, which also logged their interactions. Data on changes of angular disparity was used in the construction of Markov models. The models were employed to generate sets of synthetic angular disparity time courses, based on which we identified three distinct rotation-based solution strategies. Our analysis has implications for understanding processes involved in physical and mental rotation alike. It helps to lay grounds on which novel interactive diagnostic and training tools for spatial skills can be developed.

AB  - Home loans are the largest financial transaction consumers typically enter and the consequences from entering overpriced or unaffordable home loans can devastate individuals and entire communities. This article reviews how insights from research in experimental psychology can be utilized to protect consumers. Current policy relies too much on disclosures, which—among other limitations—can be undermined by verbal behaviors on the part of salespeople. In particular, salespeople such as mortgage brokers and lenders can exploit the fact that consumers do not know where to look for information on disclosure forms by violating conversational norms, introducing confirmation biases, and using dual tasks such as talking to consumers while they are reviewing forms. They can also exploit the fact that even consumers who know where to look can forget by part-set cuing consumers. They can even cause consumers who discover problematic terms to ignore them by providing the consumers with explanations. Policymakers need to be aware of these findings to design effective consumer-protection policies. The authors suggest alternatives for policymakers to consider.

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss methods and tools for adapting user interfaces to make them more accessible. We introduce the problem of user interface adaptation and characterize different techniques to be adapted to the user interface. We show that there is a broad range of methods and tools to transform existing interfaces to make them accessible. We describe such approaches by grouping them in two types of solutions: those that provide built-in adaptation mechanisms for the application and those which are external to the application.

AB  - Loading speed of websites reflects the website´s performance and has a significant influence on user experience and satisfaction. In this paper we analyze causes and consequences of slow loading of websites, followed by recommendations and comments on usual practice and feasibility. In the next part of the article we discuss a choice of the right online speed test in order to achieve an optimized performance of websites. Selected free online services are analyzed, with a focus on available functions and settings. Finally the issue of reliability and default settings of these services is discussed and tested by performing a series of repeated speed tests with a combination of settings.

BT  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems
SP  - 170
EP  - 179
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Self-regulated learning (SRL) and emotion regulation have been studied as separate constructs which impact students’ learning with intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). There is a general assumption that students who are proficient in enacting cognitive and metacognitive SRL processes during learning with ITSs are also proficient emotion regulators. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between metacognitive and cognitive SRL processes and emotion regulation by examining students’ self-perceived emotion regulation strategies and comparing the differences between their (1) mean self-reported negative emotions, (2) proportional learning gains (PLGs), and the frequency of (3) metacognitive and (4) cognitive strategy use as they interacted with MetaTutor, an ITS designed to teach students about the circulatory system. Students were classified into groups based on self-perceived emotion regulation strategies and results showed students who perceived themselves as using adaptive emotion regulation strategies reported less negative emotions. Although no significant differences were found between the groups’ learning outcomes, there were significant differences between the groups’ frequency use of cognitive and metacognitive processes throughout the task. Our results emphasize the need to better understand how real-time emotion regulation strategies relate to SRL processes during learning with ITSs and can be used to enhance learning outcomes by encouraging adaptive emotion regulation strategies as well as increased frequencies of metacognitive and cognitive SRL processes.

AB  - Since 25th May 2018, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies in order to strengthenthe rights of Data Subjects. Although the GDPR specifies the required information, which has to be presentedto a Data Subject, it can still be argued for a lack of transparency due to unfavourable presentation ofthe privacy policy. Furthermore, no systematic approach for the enforcement of privacy policies in technicalsystems is deployed. These issues are tackled by the both human- and machine-readable Layered Privacy Language(LPL), which models legal privacy policies. This work introduces an extension for LPL to comply with Art.12 – 14 GDPR. Additionally, user interface prototypes will be introduced to allow the creation ofLPL privacy policies by the Data Protection Officer as well as a structured presentation of the LPL privacypolicy for web-applications.

AB  - Mental disorders present a unique challenge for neuroscience because they typically alter the way that individuals think, feel, and perceive the external world, while generally sparing motor, sensory, and intellectual functioning. Historically, mental illness has been arbitrarily separated from the mainstream of medicine and research and has been typically referred to as “behavioral” entities. The latter terminology has traditionally carried a pejorative connotation because behavior in humans has been tacitly understood as “willful” in nature and, therefore, of “one’s own doing.” An unfortunate result of this historical trend has been for the psychiatric disorders to be largely ignored by the basic sciences where interests have been directed toward problems with a “sound biological basis.”

For each of these disorders, the nature and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that account for disturbances of attention will be considered. We will also discuss evidence from the field of behavioral medicine that implicates attention as contributing to particular health risk factors, including pain, obesity, physical activity, and substance dependence, particularly smoking and heavy alcohol and drug use.

EP  - 347
VL  - 17
IS  - 2
AB  - Individuals with obesity in Western societies often face weight-related stigmatization and social exclusion. Recurrent exposure to prejudice and negative social feedback alters one’s behavior in future social interactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate autonomic nervous system and affective responses to social interactions in individuals with obesity. Women and men with (n = 56) and without (n = 56) obesity participated in episodes of social inclusion and social exclusion using a virtual ball-tossing game. During the experiment, heart rate was measured and parasympathetic activity (overall high-frequency power and event-related cardiac slowing) was analyzed. Our results show that in novel social interactions, women with obesity, relative to the other groups, exhibited the strongest increase in parasympathetic activity. Furthermore, parasympathetic activity was related to a more negative body image in individuals with obesity, but not in lean individuals. Additionally, women with obesity reported a stronger decrease in mood after social exclusion than did the other participants. Our results demonstrate influences of objective and subjective bodily characteristics on parasympathetic cardio-regulation during social interactions. In particular, they show behavioral and physiological alterations during social interactions in women with obesity.

AB  - Innovation in the services area — especially in the electronic services (e-services) domain — can be systematically developed by first considering the strategic drivers and foci, then the tactical principles and enablers, and finally the operational decision attributes, all of which constitute a process or calculus of services innovation. More specifically, there are four customer drivers (i.e., collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation), three business foci (i.e., creation-focused, solution-focused and competition-focused), six business principles (i.e., reconstruct market boundaries, focus on the big picture not numbers, reach beyond existing demand, get strategic sequence right, overcome organizational hurdles and build execution into strategy), eight technical enablers (i.e., software algorithms, automation, telecommunication, collaboration, standardization, customization, organization, and globalization), and six attributes of decision informatics (i.e., decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuously-adaptive, customer-centric and computationally-intensive). It should be noted that the four customer drivers are all directed at empowering the individual — that is, at recognizing that the individual can, respectively, contribute in a collaborative situation, receive customized or personalized attention, access an integrated system or process, and obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. The developed process or calculus serves to identify the potential white spaces or blue oceans for innovation. In addition to expanding on current innovations in services and related experiences, white spaces are identified for possible future innovations; they include those that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations, safeguard our rights to privacy, protect us from the always-on, interconnected world, provide us with an authoritative search engine, and generate a GDP metric that can adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 896
EP  - 931
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
AB  - On the one hand, design patterns are solutions to recurring design problems, aimed at increasing reuse, flexibility, and maintainability. However, much prior work found that some patterns, such as the Observer and Singleton, are correlated with large code structures and argued that they are more likely to be fault prone. On the other hand, anti-patterns describe poor solutions to design and implementation problems that highlight weaknesses in the design of software systems and that may slow down maintenance and increase the risk of faults. They have been found to negatively impact change and fault-proneness. Classes participating in design patterns and anti-patterns have dependencies with other classes, e.g., static and co-change dependencies, that may propagate problems to other classes. We investigate the impact of such dependencies in object-oriented systems by studying the relations between the presence of static and co-change dependencies and (1) the fault-proneness, (2) the types of changes, and (3) the types of faults that these classes exhibit. We analyze six design patterns and 10 anti-patterns in 39 releases of ArgoUML, JFreeChart, and XercesJ, and investigate to what extent classes having dependencies with design patterns or anti-patterns have higher odds of faults than other classes. We show that in almost all releases of the three systems, classes having dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone than others while this is not always true for classes with dependencies with design patterns. We also observe that structural changes are the most common changes impacting classes having dependencies with anti-patterns. Software developers could use this knowledge about the impact of design pattern and anti-pattern dependencies to better focus their testing and reviewing activities towards the most risky classes and to propagate changes adequately.

They will likely shape the upcoming years in terms of modeling smart environments and also media consumption and interaction. This work analyzes semantic ambient media by considering business models, content and media, interaction design and consumer experience, and methods and techniques that are important to create this new form of media. Discussion is led using the state-of-the-art event of the semantic ambient media, which is the annual international workshop on Semantic Ambient Media Experience (SAME). The study also creates a vision for how ambient media will evolve and how they will look like in the future decade.

In the reading task, there was a robust word frequency effect wherein readers looked longer at low-frequency words than at high-frequency words. However, there was no frequency effect in the search task. The results suggest that decisions to move the eyes during reading are made on a different basis than they are during visual search. Implications for current models of eye movement control in reading are discussed.

SP  - 59

PB  - Springer US
CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - Psychophysiological measures have been extensively used by clinical researchers to investigate phenomena associated with the psychiatric construct of’ schizophrenia’. In contrast, practising clinicians have rarely resorted to such measures either during assessment or the course of treating these disorders. The major purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to attempt to construct a bridge between clinical research and clinical practice. This will necessitate examining, first of all, the historical application of psychophysiological research to schizophrenia. The various rationales for the use of psychophysiological measures adopted by clinical researchers will be identified and critically appraised. It will be argued that in order to provide an explanatory framework with which to view the plethora of research findings in this area, theoretical models will need to be developed which explain both the production of schizophrenic symptoms and also the role of psychophysiology in their study. Particular emphasis will be given to vulnerability models such as those proposed by Zubin and Spring (1977) and Nuechterlein and Dawson (1984). The use of psychophysiological measures to explore such models will be reviewed. Finally, the disparity between the use of psychophysiological measures in clinical research and practice will be addressed. On one hand, the limitations and obstacles relating to the application of psychophysiological measures to clinical practice will be discussed, on the other hand the potential advantages of adopting such measures for assessment and treatment evaluation will be outlined from the perspective of vulnerability models.

AB  - Google has recently announced Project Glass, a plan to embed computers into eyeglasses. Their vision is that technology should “be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” The main idea behind this technology is called augmented reality. In this chapter I will introduce the main ideas behind augmented reality, and the most interesting examples (so far) of how it is used. I’m most interested, however, in the ethical challenges this technology will present as it becomes pervasive. I describe and explain two examples; augmented reality as an extension of the home (which has privacy implications), and augmented reality advertising (which has implications for property rights and local government). Along the way I will introduce several techniques and concepts that are useful in analyzing the ethics of new technologies, including pervasive information and computing technology (PICT).

AB  - Subconscious processes, which are based on experience and which can be trained, control our behavior and follow an “internal reasoning”. They are shaped—among other things—by linguistic constructs. These subconscious processes form the “fast and intuitive thinking”. The benefits of this efficiency are associated with hazards such as prejudices, bias etc. Intuition is an essential resource of our cognitive system and can be influenced. The subconscious mind acts as an associative machine which works on the basis of pattern recognition. So we form our reality in a three-step process consisting of suppression, distortion and generalization. Associations and analogies are essential characteristics of intelligence. These aspects from behavioral psychology and cognitive science at the personal level can be used to support good decision-making and—in the context of the respective organization—they also can be used in the light of the metaphor of shaping “the subconscious mind of organizations” in order to cope with change, uncertainties and disruption.

SP  - 165
EP  - 174
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - States of the science and practice agree on the failure of security application to engage end users in the assurance of security and privacy in everyday personal computing. We propose as the cause an underlying irrational interface model of security related applications. Irrational Interfaces are counterproductive because they minimize the intended software utility and pay-off. In the case of security interactions, utility is minimized by the assumption of security primacy and the alienation of end user from the decision making process through disruptive messaging and disengaging content. Therefore effective security dialogues must be based on a rational interaction model. We present a small set of simple guidelines based on cognitive psychological research for polite interactions that appropriately optimize user engagement during tasks that users perceive as secondary. The guidelines for secure applications that politely interact with the end user are supported by a pay-off matrix that can be used to predict and evaluate rational secure interface performance. The rational, polite interface is a radical paradigm shift for security applications’ design because it integrates end users as active stakeholders and resources in the assurance of security and privacy.

SP  - 4901
EP  - 4918
VL  - 49
IS  - 12
AB  - Visual perception in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often debated in terms of enhanced local and impaired global perception. Deficits in global motion perception seem to support this characterization, although the evidence is inconsistent. We conducted a large meta-analysis on global motion, combining 48 articles on biological and coherent motion. Results provide evidence for a small global motion processing deficit in individuals with ASD compared to controls in both biological and coherent motion. This deficit appears to be present independent of the paradigm, task, dependent variable, age or IQ of the groups. Results indicate that individuals with ASD are less sensitive to these types of global motion, although the difference in neural mechanisms underlying this behavioral difference remains unclear.

EP  - 86
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This chapter highlights the importance of cognitive training and skill development in carrying out complex tasking including medical reasoning and decision making applicable to catheter-based cardiovascular interventions. The first part discussed cognitive skills from a cognitive psychology perspective. To understand the nature of cognitive skills, their foundation in human cognitive architecture was introduced as a 3-storage model. This model includes the sensory register, working memory, and long-term memory. Moreover, the operation of cognitive skills in working memory in terms of perception and higher-level cognitive processes was discussed. Based on this, in the second part of the chapter, theories of cognitive skills in medical expertise were introduced. These theories make more precise predictions as they all refer to the specific task of medical diagnosis. It is important to note, however, that although the cognitive structure and cognitive skills required for medical diagnosis are already well described, assumptions on their perceptual counterparts remain vague. Hence, future research should integrate existing theories on purely cognitive aspects of medical expertise with research on medical image perception. This is in particular true for dynamic medical images, like CT scans. Moreover, future research should be directed toward the analysis of cognitive skills required for mastery of cardiovascular interventional treatments. In sum, insight into cognitive skills is very important to address problems at a perceptual and higher cognitive level. For teaching, however, you need insight in all levels of skills required for medical diagnosis and intervention such as perceptual, cognitive, social, motors, and other.

AB  - Over the last years we have observed a remarkable shift of media spendings from offline brand building activities to online performance advertising as well as a noticeable increase in “green marketing” efforts and sustainability communication by companies of various branches. In this paper we bring these two research streams together. We develop and perform a non reactive A/B-test that enables us to evaluate the influence of sustainability information on the customers decision to buy a product by clicking on an ad on a search engine results page (SERP). We analyze campaign performance data from a European e-commerce retailer, apply a Bayesian parameter estimation to compare the two groups, and discuss the implications of the results.

AB  - Evidence for semantic preview benefit (PB) from parafoveal words has been elusive for reading alphabetic scripts such as English. Here we report semantic PB for noncompound characters in Chinese reading with the boundary paradigm. In addition, PBs for orthographic relatedness and, as a numeric trend, for phonological relatedness were obtained. Results are in agreement with other research suggesting that the Chinese writing system is based on a closer association between graphic form and meaning than is alphabetic script. We discuss implications for notions of serial attention shifts and parallel distributed processing of words during reading.

BT  - Attention in Cognitive Systems. Theories and Systems from an Interdisciplinary Viewpoint
SP  - 75
EP  - 90
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Most cognitive studies of language acquisition in both natural systems and artificial systems have focused on the role of purely linguistic information as the central constraint. However, we argue that non-linguistic information, such as vision and talkers’ attention, also plays a major role in language acquisition. To support this argument, this chapter reports two studies of embodied language learning – one on natural intelligence and one on artificial intelligence. First, we developed a novel method that seeks to describe the visual learning environment from a young child’s point of view. A multi-camera sensing environment is built which consists of two head-mounted mini cameras that are placed on both the child’s and the parent’s foreheads respectively. The major result is that the child uses their body to constrain the visual information s/he perceives and by doing so adapts to an embodied solution to deal with the reference uncertainty problem in language learning. In our second study, we developed a learning system trained in an unsupervised mode in which users perform everyday tasks while providing natural language descriptions of their behaviors. The system collects acoustic signals in concert with user-centric multisensory information from non-speech modalities, such as user’s perspective video, gaze positions, head directions and hand movements. A multimodal learning algorithm uses this data to first spot words from continuous speech and then associate action verbs and object names with their perceptually grounded meanings. Similar to human learners, the central ideas of our computational system are to make use of non-speech contextual information to facilitate word spotting, and utilize body movements as deictic references to associate temporally co-occurring data from different modalities and build a visually grounded lexicon.

AB  - In this chapter, attentional disturbances resulting from damage to brain systems that govern sensory selection are discussed. Hemi-inattention and neglect syndromes are perhaps the most intriguing disorders of attention seen by clinical neuropsychologists. We begin with a discussion of these syndromes and continue with a more general consideration of temporal and parietal lobe influences on attention. The hemispheric asymmetries of attention are then considered. We conclude with a brief review of the role of the thalamus as an informational gateway in the control of attention.

Furthermore, there is a natural temporal order to all physical events and human experience. Though these tenets are intuitively evident and seem obvious today, the basis for people’s experience of space and time has been one of the enduring problems for philosophers and scientists throughout the ages.

BT  - Advances in Human Error, Reliability, Resilience, and Performance
SP  - 138
EP  - 150
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Human Reliability Assessment is an essential tool for estimating a human operator’s propensity to commit errors based on available information and estimation of performance shaping factors. Even when estimates are approximate, HRA can provide valuable insights into task performance and vulnerabilities to accidental or volitional human actions. Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) for Human Reliability Analysis are traditional determined as static across all operating conditions. However, it is likely that the PSFs are dynamic and dependent on the state of the plant. For example, available time, stress, and complexity factors change rapidly if the plant enters abnormal operating conditions. Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) are modernizing control rooms with digital systems and accompanying Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) to enable operation past their planned 40-year life expectancies. New research is needed to identify how digital HMIs interact with dynamic PSFs to influence Human Error Reliability. Here we examine an experimental paradigm utilizing a microworld with non-expert operators to assess how context-aware HMIs could reduce human error by adapting the presentation of information based on the dynamic PSFs estimated from the plant’s current state.

AB  - This article presents a classification method that makes possible the detection of important decision strategies that people use in nonrisky multiattribute decision tasks. The classification method incorporates a multimethod approach that combines elements of both structural modeling and process tracing. We begin with a discussion of nine common characteristics of decision strategies and then classify 13 decision strategies on the basis of these characteristics. Next, we demonstrate that six of the characteristics can be used to develop one outcome-based and three process-based metrics. In addition, we present an algorithm that shows how to use the metrics. We demonstrate that using our metrics in conjunction with a measure for direction of search allows identification of most of the 13 decision strategies. Finally, we outline the potential of our research for the design of decision support systems such as online shops.

The pattern of trends, which will impact upon everything from branding to strategy, are: mobile living, price sensitivity, gamification of price, pricing inefficiency, big data and promotions, concierge living, is loyalty dead, discounting forever, managing complexity, and choice and maximising behaviour. Each pattern of behaviour is robustly explained and supported by empirical evidence provided by the Future Foundation. The article concludes with four predictions that the patterns are driving namely, loyalty, temporary permanence, deals and value.

JO  - Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience
SP  - 113
EP  - 121
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Many studies have claimed that hemispheric projections are split precisely at the foveal midline and so hemispheric asymmetry affects word recognition right up to the point of fixation. To investigate this claim, four-letter words and nonwords were presented to the left or right of fixation, either close to fixation in foveal vision or farther from fixation in extrafoveal vision. Presentation accuracy was controlled using an eyetracker linked to a fixation-contingent display. Words presented foveally produced identical performance on each side of fixation, but words presented extrafoveally showed a clear left-hemisphere (LH) advantage. Nonwords produced no evidence of hemispheric asymmetry in any location. Foveal stimuli also produced an identical word-nonword effect on each side of fixation, whereas extrafoveal stimuli produced a word-nonword effect only for LH (not right-hemisphere) displays. These findings indicate that functional unilateral projections to contralateral hemispheres exist in extrafoveal locations but provide no evidence of a functional division in hemispheric processing at fixation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Aquaponic systems are often designated as sustainable food production systems that are still facing various challenges, especially when they are considered as a commercial endeavour that needs to compete on the market. The early stages of the aquaponics industry have witnessed a number of unrealistic statements about the economic advantageousness of aquaponics. This chapter deals with these topics and discusses them critically. The latest scientific literature and current personal experiences of European commercial aquaponics farmers are taken into account on three levels: The horticulture side of production, the aquaculture side of production and the early data on the market response to aquaponics, emphasising the marketing issues and public acceptance of aquaponics. In summary, the chapter does not provide an “off-the-peg” solution to evaluate the economic performance of a particular aquaponics system. Instead it provides a broad database that enables an estimation of the efficiency of a planned system more realistically, pointing to challenges that the commercial aquaponics early adopters faced that are important lessons for future aquaponic endeavours, particularly in Europe.

AB  - When you order a drink at your local juice bar, you notice that the flexing part of the straw has a picture of a woman who is holding her hands up. As you flex the straw, the woman bends backwards. This is a clever ad for a yoga center that also presents the link to its website. To what extent do consumers talk about such creative advertising? And what do they say about it? Do they mention the brand name, or focus only on the clever execution? Research has shown that creative media advertising, of which the drinking straw is an example, may have a positive effect on consumers’ attitudes and brand recall (Dahlén et al. 2009). But do creative media also lead to an increase in word of mouth? And to what extent is this word of mouth linked to the brand itself?

JO  - Psychological Research
SP  - 452
EP  - 465
VL  - 75
IS  - 6
AB  - The present paper presents an overview of research on the role of saccades in multitasking. Multitasking is known to cause performance costs in terms of increased response times and/or error rates. However, most of the previous research on multitasking was focused on manual and vocal action demands, and the role of eye movements has been largely neglected. As a consequence, saccade execution was mainly considered with respect to its functional role in gathering new visual information (input side of information processing). However, several more recent experiments confirmed that saccades both exhibit and cause dual-task costs in the context of other actions and should thus also be regarded as a response modality (output side of information processing). Theoretical implications as well as several open issues for future research will be outlined.

TI  - Response Mixture Modeling: Accounting for Heterogeneity in Item Characteristics across Response Times
JO  - Psychometrika
SP  - 279
EP  - 297
VL  - 83
IS  - 2
AB  - In item response theory modeling of responses and response times, it is commonly assumed that the item responses have the same characteristics across the response times. However, heterogeneity might arise in the data if subjects resort to different response processes when solving the test items. These differences may be within-subject effects, that is, a subject might use a certain process on some of the items and a different process with different item characteristics on the other items. If the probability of using one process over the other process depends on the subject’s response time, within-subject heterogeneity of the item characteristics across the response times arises. In this paper, the method of response mixture modeling is presented to account for such heterogeneity. Contrary to traditional mixture modeling where the full response vectors are classified, response mixture modeling involves classification of the individual elements in the response vector. In a simulation study, the response mixture model is shown to be viable in terms of parameter recovery. In addition, the response mixture model is applied to a real dataset to illustrate its use in investigating within-subject heterogeneity in the item characteristics across response times.

TI  - Making Recommendations for Decision Processes Based on Aggregated Decision Data Models
BT  - Business Information Systems
SP  - 272
EP  - 283
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The decision making process is a sequence of (mostly mental) actions. But individual decision making is a fuzzy process that lacks a clear workflow structure. This issue may decrease the quality of data-centric business decisions where information must be processed in the right order and used at the right time. We argue that, when faced with such a decision, step-by-step recommendation provides help in steering the process and valuable guidance in improving it. Our Data Decision Model (DDM) is an acyclic graph that suits the fuzzy nature of decision processes. In our approach, the recommendation is based on an aggregated DDM extracted from a large number of individuals. This paper introduces two algorithms that, given a certain state of the process, provide suggestions for the next action the decision maker should perform.

VL  - 30
IS  - 2
AB  - Three groups of 20 dyads planned the MTV Music Video Awards Show over computers. The groups varied in whether they could send 4-line, 10-line, or 18-line messages, in part to examine whether increased planning efficiency in computer-mediated communication reflects communication strategies associated with constraints on message size. The results demonstrate that increased efficiency is not a function of such design features as the maximum message that may be sent. However, the subjects in the 4-line condition sent shorter messages to one another, were less likely to engage in a strategy of making multiple suggestions that required a single assent, and were more likely to differ in the relative proportion of their contributions to the discourse. The subjects in the 10-line condition had shorter maximum messages (and proportionately more disfluencies) than did those in the 18-line condition, despite the finding that the maximum messages of the latter would have also fit within 10 lines. Thus, the results also support a claim that size of the text window may result in different discourse management strategies and may influence an initial discourse-planning stage.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Several mutually reinforcing trends have made category management (CM) one of the most critical marketing and operational decisions for retailers. German retailers and consumer goods producers recently rated “optimization of product portfolio and category management” the most important task for achieving performance goals (Breuer et al. 2009). This is not surprising as shelf space competition in retail stores is at an all-time high, driven by the competitive need to constantly introduce new products. There has been significant product proliferation since the 1990s (Greenhouse July 17, 2005). The average number of items in overall store assortments increased by 30% between 2000 and 2009 (EHI Retail Institute 2010). In confectionery, for example, the number of brands rose by more than 40% between 1997 and 2001, but overall volume by only 0.8% (Carlotti et al. 2006). Additionally, most retailers suffer from decreasing space productivity. Gutgeld et al. (2009) concluded that 19 out of 24 European retailers were unable to maintain their space productivity.

SP  - 236

VL  - 43
IS  - 1
AB  - Difficulties in the regulation of emotion are hypothesized to play a key role in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural activity during task preparation and image presentation during different emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, in PTSD. Patients with combat-related PTSD (n = 18) and combat-exposed controls (n = 27) were instructed to feel, reappraise or suppress their emotional response prior to viewing combat-related images during fMRI, while also providing arousal ratings. In the reappraise condition, patients showed lower medial prefrontal neural activity during task preparation and higher prefrontal neural activity during image presentation, compared with controls. No difference in neural activity was observed between the groups during the feel or suppress conditions, although patients rated images as more arousing than controls across all three conditions. By distinguishing between preparation and active regulation, and between reappraisal and suppression, the current findings reveal greater complexity regarding the dynamics of emotion regulation in PTSD and have implications for our understanding of the etiology and treatment of PTSD.

JO  - Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
SP  - 287
EP  - 309
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
AB  - The recognition heuristic is a noncompensatory strategy for inferring which of two alternatives, one recognized and the other not, scores higher on a criterion. According to it, such inferences are based solely on recognition. We generalize this heuristic to tasks with multiple alternatives, proposing a model of how people identify the consideration sets from which they make their final decisions. In doing so, we address concerns about the heuristic’s adequacy as a model of behavior: Past experiments have led several authors to conclude that there is no evidence for a noncompensatory use of recognition but clear evidence that recognition is integrated with other information. Surprisingly, however, in no study was this competing hypothesis—the compensatory integration of recognition—formally specified as a computational model. In four studies, we specify five competing models, conducting eight model comparisons. In these model comparisons, the recognition heuristic emerges as the best predictor of people’s inferences.

AB  - Retail is one of the largest sectors in today’s economy. The global retail sector is estimated to have revenues of USD 28 trillion in 2019 (with approximately USD 5.5 trillion sales in the USA alone). This sector represents 31% of the world’s GDP and employs billions of people throughout the globe. A large and growing component of this is e-commerce or e-tail, which includes products and services ordered via the Internet, with sales estimated to be about USD 840 billion in 2014, and expected to grow at a rate of about 20% over the subsequent years. Analytics is gaining increasing prominence in this sector with the retail analytics market size being estimated at over USD 3.52 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 19.7% over the next few years.

SP  - 113

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This work proposes a process for formulating a model and estimation scheme to predict changes in decision authority with a simulated autonomous driving assistant. The unique component of this modeling approach is the use of direct estimation of governing mental decision states via recursive psychophysiological inference. Treating characteristic quantities of the environment as inputs, and behavioral and physiological signals as outputs, we propose the estimation of intermediate or underlying psychological states of the human can be used to predict the decision to engage or disengage a driving assistant, using methods of stochastic filtering. Such a framework should enable techniques to optimally fuse information and thereby improve performance in human-autonomy driving interactions.

AB  - Eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) were compared with a group of age-matched controls on both reflexive saccade and antisaccade tasks. While reflexive, visually guided saccades led to equivalent performance in both groups, PD patients were slower, made more errors, and showed reduced gain on antisaccades (AS). This is consistent with previous results showing that PD patients have no difficulty with reflexive saccades but show deficiencies in a number of voluntary saccade paradigms. Moreover, visual information in the form of landmarks improves AS performance more for PD patients than controls, a finding analogous to results seen with other motor acts such as target-directed pointing. Results are discussed in terms of a two-process model of attention and eye movements.

The work is based on the analysis of gesture expressivity over time, that we have conducted on two clips of 2D animations. The first results point out two types of modulations in gesture expressivity that we relate to the rhetorical functions of the discourse. These results extend the knowledge about gesture expressivity from emotion and personality issues to pragmatical ones. An evaluation study is proposed to measure the effects of the modulations.

After tracing its foundational principles (early focus on users, empirical measurement using prototypes and iterative design) back to 1985s seminal paper by Gould and Lewis, we will highlight each of five central categories of design activities (Scope, Analyse, Design, Validate and Deliver) performed in UCD. Potential integration of UCD into two popular categorizations of software development (User Interface First vs. User Interface Later) will be explored and then demonstrated in a real life case study from the field of electronic engineering along with a practical takeaway regarding the relationship of UCD and eLearning.

SP  - 730
EP  - 743
VL  - 50
IS  - 2
AB  - Most past research on sequential sampling models of decision-making have assumed a time homogeneous process (i.e., parameters such as drift rates and boundaries are constant and do not change during the deliberation process). This has largely been due to the theoretical difficulty in testing and fitting more complex models. In recent years, the development of simulation-based modeling approaches matched with Bayesian fitting methodologies has opened the possibility of developing more complex models such as those with time-varying properties. In the present work, we discuss a piecewise variant of the well-studied diffusion decision model (termed pDDM) that allows evidence accumulation rates to change during the deliberation process. Given the complex, time-varying nature of this model, standard Bayesian parameter estimation methodologies cannot be used to fit the model. To overcome this, we apply a recently developed simulation-based, hierarchal Bayesian methodology called the probability density approximation (PDA) method. We provide an analysis of this methodology and present results of parameter recovery experiments to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of this approach. With those established, we fit pDDM to data from a perceptual experiment where information changes during the course of trials. This extensible modeling platform opens the possibility of applying sequential sampling models to a range of complex non-stationary decision tasks.

AB  - This chapter examines the various types, sources, textual features, and discourse structures of scam emails. Scam emails, like other forms of phishing, are a form of email-based deception where the phisher pretends to solicit a business partnership or announce a lottery winning in order to steal sensitive security information from the receiver of the email. This chapter also provides an overview of current literature and methods that have been applied to the study of phishing and email scams. The discourse structures that are analyzed include the textual and narrative constructions of the emails. The chapter concludes that scam emails are a function of global economic challenges that tend to promote unethical and fraudulent practices on the Internet.

EP  - 233
VL  - 169
IS  - 3
AB  - There is an urgent need to improve the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia despite the introduction of important new medications. New treatment insights may come from appreciating the therapeutic implications of model psychoses. In particular, basic and clinical studies have employed the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, as a probe of NMDA receptor contributions to cognition and behavior. These studies illustrate a translational neuroscience approach for probing mechanistic hypotheses related to the neurobiology and treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders. Two particular pathophysiologic themes associated with schizophrenia, the disturbance of cortical connectivity and the disinhibition of glutamatergic activity may be modeled by the administration of NMDA receptor antagonists. The purpose of this review is to consider the possibility that agents that attenuate these two components of NMDA receptor antagonist response may play complementary roles in the treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - This is a validation study, aiming to explore the effectiveness of a set of virtual environments for producing emotionally significant responses in students with high levels of test anxiety in order to be able to implement them later in treatment. Twenty-one students agreed to take part, 11 with high test anxiety and 10 with low test anxiety. The virtual environments were prepared in chronological order: the student’s home, then the metro, and finally the corridor and lecture hall where the examination takes place. The results showed that the high-testanxiety group presented higher levels of anxiety and depression than the low-test-anxiety group during exposure to the virtual environments. This study shows that virtual reality is able to provoke emotional responses in students with high test anxiety. This validation study should be followed up with treatment studies to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality therapy for treating test anxiety.

SP  - 326
EP  - 349
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - We introduce a novel fusion framework for real-time head pose estimation using a tailored Kalman Filter. This approach estimates the pose from intensity images in monocular video data. The method is robust to extreme head rotations and varying illumination, with real-time capability. Our framework incorporates the head pose computed from a keypoint-based tracking scheme into the prediction step of the Kalman Filter and the head pose computed from a facial-landmark-based detection scheme into the correction step. The head pose from the tracking scheme is estimated from 2D keypoints tracked in two consecutive frames in the region of the head and their 3D projection on a simple geometric model. In contrast, the head pose from the detection scheme is estimated from 2D facial landmarks detected in each frame and their 3D correspondences retrieved through triangulation. In each scheme, the head pose results from the minimization of the reprojection error from the 3D-2D correspondences. In each iteration, we update the state transition matrix of the filter and subsequently the estimated covariance. We evaluated our approach on a publicly available dataset and compared with related methods of the state of the art. Our approach could achieve similar performance in terms of mean average error, while operating in real time. Furthermore, we tested our method on our own dataset, to evaluate its performance in the presence of large head rotations. We show good results even in cases where facial landmarks are partially occluded.

AB  - Computational aesthetics, which bridges science and art, is emerging as a new interdisciplinary field. This paper concentrates on two main aspects of computational aesthetics: aesthetic measurement and quantification, generative art, and then proposes a design generation framework. On aesthetic measurement and quantification, we review different types of features used in measurement, the currently used evaluation methods, and their applications. On generative art, we focus on both fractal art and abstract paintings modeled on well-known artists’ styles. In general, computational aesthetics exploits computational methods for aesthetic expressions. In other words, it enables computer to appraise beauty and ugliness and also automatically generate aesthetic images. Computational aesthetics has been widely applied to many areas, such as photography, fine art, Chinese hand-writing, web design, graphic design, and industrial design. We finally propose a design generation methodology, utilizing techniques from both aesthetic measurements and generative art.

AB  - The current study investigated if deficits in processing emotional expression affect facial identity processing and vice versa in children with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism and IQ and age matched typically developing children classified faces either by emotional expression, thereby ignoring facial identity or by facial identity disregarding emotional expression. Typically developing children processed facial identity independently from facial expressions but processed facial expressions in interaction with identity. Children with autism processed both facial expression and identity independently of each other. They selectively directed their attention to one facial parameter despite variations in the other. Results indicate that there is no interaction in processing facial identity and emotional expression in autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - One of the most important tasks of the anaesthetist is to monitor the patient’s vital signs in order to evaluate the patient’s state, and to control it according to the needs of the surgical procedure. To support the anaesthetists’ decision making process sensor techniques have been continuously developed by the medical industry. Hence, an increasing large number of vital parameters (e.g.: blood pressures, EEG, ECG, inspired and expired gas fractions etc.) are nowadays displayed by modern monitoring devices especially during highly invasive surgery [1–3]. As a result of this development, over 95% of anaesthesia based critical incidents could be theoretically detected only with the help of a monitor (over 65 % without any organ damage) [4] . Obviously, these new measurement techniques have improved the patient’s safety during the surgical procedure significantly.

JO  - Behaviormetrika
SP  - 527
EP  - 563
VL  - 45
IS  - 2
AB  - Log data from educational assessments attract more and more attention and large-scale assessment programs have started providing log data as scientific use files. Such data generated as a by-product of computer-assisted data collection has been known as paradata in survey research. In this paper, we integrate log data from educational assessments into a taxonomy of paradata. To provide a generic framework for the analysis of log data, finite state machines are suggested. Beyond its computational value, the specific benefit of using finite state machines is achieved by separating platform-specific log events from the definition of indicators by states. Specifically, states represent filtered log data given a theoretical process model, and therefore, encode the information of log files selectively. The approach is empirically illustrated using log data of the context questionnaires of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). We extracted item-level response time components from questionnaire items that were administered as item batteries with multiple questions on one screen and related them to the item responses. Finally, the taxonomy and the finite state machine approach are discussed with respect to the definition of complete log data, the verification of log data and the reproducibility of log data analyses.

CY  - New York, NY
AB  - Consumers observe many stimuli in the environment when they choose or consume foods. These external stimuli can be differentiated as having a direct or indirect effect on people. Direct stimuli aim to influence consumers’ perception of a product (e.g., its expected taste) and their food choice. Nutrition labels, for example, aim to help consumers to make healthy food choices. In contrast, indirect stimuli are not knowingly observed by consumers but affect their food consumption subconsciously. For instance, people will buy more bread when the smell of freshly baked bread is spread throughout a supermarket. In this chapter, we review studies that have investigated how consumers are influenced by direct and indirect stimuli. We elaborate on the psychological factors that are involved in the perception and processing of these two stimuli types.

JO  - International Journal of Social Robotics
SP  - 555
EP  - 568
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - Nowadays, physically impaired people still struggle with daily tasks when using mobility aid devices, whether for crossing doors, parking or manoeuvring in their homes. In this context, assistive robotics can offer solutions to those problems, thus increasing the users’ quality of life. However, studies must be performed to determine the best architecture for human–robot interaction. In this work, we propose a collaborative navigation strategy for improving users’ skills for driving assistive vehicles. We present four navigation modes: manual, assisted manual, autonomous and assisted autonomous. In particular in the two assisted modes, the system is able to predict the user’s motion intentions, reducing his/her workload. The system was validated in a real world environment with a population of twenty volunteers. Objective and subjective metrics were used to asses the system’s performance and usability, with special consideration to human factors. Results show that the system aids users to perform navigation tasks in a clear and compliant manner using a robotic assistive vehicle, while decreasing their perceived workload by 15% for the assisted manual, 41% for the autonomous and 40% for the assisted autonomous, when compared to the manual mode. Additionally, it is shown that if autonomous navigation sets a lower bound for user workload, the system approximates this bound while improving performance.

JO  - Sex Roles
SP  - 683
EP  - 698
VL  - 79
IS  - 11
AB  - The present study investigated how task demand (cognitive load and interactivity) and avatar sexualization in a video game influenced rape myth acceptance (RMA), hostile sexism, and self-objectification. In a between-subjects design, 300 U.S. college students either played or watched someone else play a videogame as either a sexualized or non-sexualized female avatar under high (memorize 7 symbols) or low (memorize 2 symbols) cognitive load. Hypotheses were derived from the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and perspectives on stereotype processing. Results contradicted hypotheses that greater task demands and sexualization would produce greater RMA, hostile sexism, and self-objectification. Instead, we found that sexualization did not affect these variables. Greater cognitive load reduced rape myth acceptance and hostile sexism for those in the sexualized avatar condition, but it did not affect self-objectification. We discuss these results with respect to the LC4MP and suggest that the processing of stereotype-inconsistent information might be the underlying cause of these unexpected findings. These results provide tentative evidence that cognitively demanding video game environments may prompt players to focus on stereotype-inconsistent, rather than stereotype-consistent, social information.

AB  - In this paper, we present a framework for an expressive virtual storyteller for children. Our virtual storyteller displays facial expressions of appraisals related to story events. The facial expressions are animated jointly with deictic gestures towards graphical elements representing story events. We describe a preliminary study that we conducted with 23 children. We discuss the impact of facial expressions of appraisals on children’s memorization of story events, their perception of characters’ appraisals, their subjective perception of the virtual storyteller and more generally how emotion combines with joint attention.

TI  - Teachers’ information processing and judgement accuracy: effects of information consistency and accountability
JO  - European Journal of Psychology of Education
AB  - Research has shown that teachers are able to adapt their processing strategy of student information to situational demands, whereby they flexibly use either an automatic and category-based strategy or a controlled and information-integrating strategy. However, the effect of teachers’ accountability for task and the consistency of student information on strategy use is less clear. In two experimental studies, teachers were presented with consistent and inconsistent student profiles, whereby accountability levels were systematically varied. In the first study, the attention to and memory of information were investigated as indicators of changes in information processing strategy. In the second study, resulting changes in judgement accuracy were investigated. Results of study 1 provided support for the theoretical assumption that people apply the category-based strategy when confronted with consistent information under low accountability conditions, while inconsistent information and high accountability conditions led to the use of information-integration strategy. Results of study 2 showed that teachers’ judgement accuracy generally increased in relation to high accountability conditions and to lesser extent profile consistency, whereby inaccuracy reflected both under- and overestimation of student ability. The combined results suggest that the use of differential information processing strategies not only leads to differences in the attention to and processing of information, but also results in differences in the quality of judgements and decision making, especially under high accountability conditions.

AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the effects of social versus non-social stimuli on postural responses in 21 boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (mean age of 11.6 ± 1.5) compared with 30 typically developing (TD) boys (mean age of 11.7 ± 1.8). Postural control of children was examined while they were standing on a force plate and viewing images of an object, male face, or female face in sequence. Each image was shown in two trials and each trial lasted for 20 s. Results indicated a significant interaction between group and task (p < 0.05), meaning that children with ASD but not TD children showed an increased postural sway during face tasks than during object task. Furthermore children with higher autism severity compared to those with lower severity showed an increased change in response to social stimuli (p < 0.01). It seems that the postural control of children with ASD was more affected by the social stimuli than TD children.

Integrated care should be regarded as a complex ecosystem of organizations, caregivers, technologies, and care recipients who are all interdependent. But the most important aspect is that the focus is on the individual care recipient.

Initiatives focus on acceptance by users, the use of service platforms, electronic health records, cooperation between health and social care, supporting the role of the informal caregiver, and public procurement of innovations. Projects have in common that they are all focusing on the organizational changes needed to overcome barriers that currently prevent large-scale rollout and to build the critical mass needed to live up to the expectations raised by the results of small-scale pilots. This chapter presents the result of a literature review and several years of experience in carrying out the before-mentioned research projects.

JO  - European Surgery
SP  - 155

VL  - 44
IS  - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic communication between health organisations takes place within strong networks. The technical und procedural support of electronic health communication is of increasing importance for optimal treatment quality and patient safety. Due to the federal organisation of the healthcare system in Austria, the electronic health record – Elektronische Gesundheitsakte (ELGA) – is designed as a distributed system with central components for patient and healthcare provider identification and authorisation management. The network is displayed on several layers, a special legal basis is yet to be enacted and many technical components have already been tested and proved. Unambiguous identification of health service providers and patients, easier workflows and state-of-the-art document management will be among the main benefits of ELGA. METHODS: Description of the design and making of ELGA. RESULTS: The article provides information on the technical and constitutional set-up and on the IT-Architecture of ELGA. Special features as the portal, the e-medication and the nationwide harmonisation process of medical documents are discussed. The Masterplan, the cost and benefit analysis and the European health record project epSOS are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond and additionally to the upcoming ELGA law and the Data Protection Rules, ELGA has to comply with the relevant international standards. The principal challenge lies, however, in organisational and procedural questions as well as in raising confidence and acceptance for this new electronic health management tool.

SP  - 231

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Since the 1960s, grammatical formalisms and parsing methods developed originally for natural language strings have been extended to represent and process two-dimensional visual expressions such as mathematics notation and various kinds of diagrams. But despite all of the effort, there has been negligible impact on human-computer interfaces to support visual modes of communication. Why? As with all tech transfer issues, some of the reasons may be beyond a researcher's control. However, I believe that two of the contributing factors in the case of visual language (VL) parsing can and should be addressed by the research field. First, the field needs to consolidate and communicate its results. This is in fact not trivial for higher-dimensional visual language representation and parsing, and I will try to illustrate why. Second, researchers have to look harder for the right application domains. One of the obvious applications is the interpretation of visual language expressions constructed with GUIs. While grammatical representation and parsing may bring something to the table, the problem of interpretation may be solvable with simpler techniques. I will discuss some other application areas and my experience with them: design support, smart screen layout for electronic publishing, and visual focusing for attributed graphs.

AB  - With the development of new medical auxiliaries such as virtual reality and surgery robotics, recommender systems are emerged to interact with the medical auxiliaries and support doctor’s decisions and operations, especially in collaborative healthcare, recommender systems can interactively take into account the preferences and concerns from both patients and doctors. However, how to apply and integrate recommender systems is still not clear in collaborative healthcare. Therefore, from practical perspective this paper investigates the application of recommender systems in three typical collaborative healthcare domains, which are augmented/virtual reality, medicine and surgery robotics. The results not only provide the insights of how to integrate recommender systems with healthcare auxiliaries but also discuss the practical guidance of how to design recommender systems in collaborative healthcare.

AB  - In recent years, computer games have become an important part of children’s lives. Gaming is not only one of their favorite pastime activities, but games are also increasingly used by marketers in an attempt to influence children’s purchase behavior. Today, almost every food and beverage brand targeting children has an advergame on its website. Advergames are“computer games specifically created to function as advertisements to promote brands”, containing brand identifiers such as logos and brand characters (Kretchmer, 2005: 7). Games can also be powerful learning tools. Several authors (e.g., Gee, 2003; Prensky, 2001) argue that computer games can be more enjoyable, more interesting and thus more effective than traditional learning modes to increase children’s knowledge. Empirical studies that evaluated the impact of the use of games within disciplines such as mathematics, science, language, geography and computer science show positive outcomes in terms of learning effectiveness in relation to curricu- lar objectives (e.g., Papastergiou, 2009; Rosas et al., 2003). However, these authors mainly focus on the learning ability of games rather than their persuasive impact for social marketing purposes. In the area of health education, playing computer games has often been seen with skepticism (e.g., Bale, 1994; Funk and Buchman, 1995).

In cases where no normative solution was available, we found a clear preference for diversity-seeking in the gain domain and diversity-aversion in the loss domain, regardless of cognitive thinking style. However, in cases where one alternative normatively dominated the other, participants high in deliberative thinking style were more calibrated to normative behavior, regardless of whether their intuitive tendency preference and the normative solution were contradictory or pointed in the same direction. Our findings support a model in which deliberative but not intuitive thinking style is the crucial predictor of rational behavior, since it enables people to better adjust their intuitive preference anchor when normative considerations require doing so.

JO  - Marketing Letters
SP  - 261

VL  - 29
IS  - 2
AB  - Nine-ending pricing is a common marketing technique because of the traditional belief that consumers pay more attention to the dollar digits and less attention to the penny digits. This research challenges the universal effectiveness of nine-ending pricing and identifies thinking style as a moderator for the nine-ending price effect with analytic (holistic) thinkers more (less) prone to the effect of nine-ending prices. Further, we examine cognitive resource as a boundary condition for the moderating effect. Our results demonstrate that holistic thinkers are not responsive to nine-ending prices when they have unlimited cognitive resources. With limited cognitive resources (e.g., under time pressure or cognitive load), both holistic and analytic thinkers are subject to the nine-ending price effect. We identify the lack of holistic thinking as a mechanism underlying the nine-ending effect.

JO  - Biological Cybernetics

EP  - 669
VL  - 109
IS  - 6
AB  - The activity of certain parietal neurons has been interpreted as encoding affordances (directly perceivable opportunities) for grasping. Separate computational models have been developed for infant grasp learning and affordance learning, but no single model has yet combined these processes in a neurobiologically plausible way. We present the Integrated Learning of Grasps and Affordances (ILGA) model that simultaneously learns grasp affordances from visual object features and motor parameters for planning grasps using trial-and-error reinforcement learning. As in the Infant Learning to Grasp Model, we model a stage of infant development prior to the onset of sophisticated visual processing of hand–object relations, but we assume that certain premotor neurons activate neural populations in primary motor cortex that synergistically control different combinations of fingers. The ILGA model is able to extract affordance representations from visual object features, learn motor parameters for generating stable grasps, and generalize its learned representations to novel objects.

AB  - Focusing on deixis in human computer interaction this paper presents interdisciplinary work on the use of co-verbal gesture . Empirical investigations, theoretical modeling, and computational simulations with an anthropomorphic agent are based upon comparable settings and common representations. Findings pertain to the coordination of verbal and gestural constituents in deictic utterances. We discovered high variability in the temporal synchronization of such constituents in task-oriented dialogue, and a theoretical treatment thereof is presented. With respect to simulation we exemplarily show how the influence of situational characteristics on the choice of verbal and nonverbal constituents can be accounted for. In particular, this depends on spatio-temporal relations between speaker and the objects they refer to in dialogue.

AB  - The effect of contextual constraint on eye movements in reading was examined by asking subjects to read sentences that contained a target word that varied in contextual constraint; high-, medium-, or low-constraint target words were used. Subjects fixated low-constraint target words longer than they did either high- or medium-constraint target words. In addition, they skipped high-constraint words more than they did either medium- or low-constraint target words. The results further confirm that contextual constraint has a strong influence on eye movements during reading.

AB  - Alignment forms the basis of successful communication. It can be seen as the most efficient means for action coordination of cooperating agents, covering adaptation processes operating without an explicit exchange of information states. One critical condition of alignment consists of joint attention. We present work on equipping a virtual human with the capability of reaching joint attention with its human interlocutor. On the one hand, mechanisms to detect the human’s focus of attention are employed. On the other hand, basic cognitive as well as intentional processes underlying the phenomenon of joint attention are incorporated in our agent’s cognitive architecture. In this context, a dynamic working memory and a partner model accounting for theory of mind and intentionality are crucial constituents.

JO  - Psychological Research
SP  - 20
EP  - 35
VL  - 62
IS  - 1
AB  - It has often been reported that, in the presence of static reference stimuli, briefly presented visual targets are perceived as being closer to the fixation point than they actually are. The first purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the same phenomenon can be demonstrated in a situation without static reference stimuli. Experiment 1, with position naming as the task, showed that such a central shift is also observed under these conditions. This finding is of importance because it completes an explanation for central near-location errors in the partial-report bar-probe task. The second purpose of the present study was to provide an explanation for these central shifts. For this explanation information about the exact size of the central shift is required. In Exps. 2, 3, and 4, with cursor setting as the task, it was attempted to assess more precisely the size of the central shifts. These experiments revealed that two different factors determine the results in cursor setting tasks; a factor “target position” and a factor “cursor position.” Experiment 5 showed that it is the point of fixation, not the fixation point, that serves, at least in part, as the reference point in this type of task. All the findings together allow us to conclude that the target positions are underestimated by about 10%. From vision research it is known that saccadic eye movements, performed for bringing a target in the fovea, also show an undershoot of about 10%. It is therefore concluded that the system in charge of saccadic eye movements also provides the metric in visual space within a single eye fixation.

AB  - The difference between simple and choice manual reaction time (RT) has been taken to be a measure of the time necessary for various cognitive operations. In contrast, simple and choice saccadic latencies (SL – time elapsing from stimulus onset to saccade initiation) are quite similar, suggesting that such responses may be more automated. In the present investigation, SL and saccadic reaction times (SR – time elapsing from stimulus onset to saccade completion) were measured for targets appearing in the same and different locations, and to different ends of compound stimuli (big arrows) composed of small elements (little arrows) using either the global figure or the local elements as indicators of required saccade direction. In addition, measures of sequence learning were obtained behaviorally over iterative trials (decreases in response time) and with post-test interrogation. The results indicated that local response times were significantly slower than choice or global response times. Both global precedence and consistency effects were observed. Robust sequence learning was observed under the local condition, but only in the choice condition were all subjects able to recall the sequence correctly. These results are discussed in terms of proposed models of visual perception and saccade generation based on parallel processing.

AB  - In this chapter, we review the existing works regarding visual quality assessment in computer graphics. This broad area of research includes many sub-domains which make intensive use of quality assessment and/or artifact visibility evaluation: geometry processing, rendering, HDR imaging, tone-mapping, and stereo vision. For each of these sub-domains, we present the existing objective quality metrics, the subjective quality experiments as well as an evaluation and comparison of their performance. We broadly classify these existing works into image-based (i.e., evaluating artifacts introduced in 2D rendered images and videos) and model-based approaches (i.e., artifacts introduced on the 3D models themselves). Finally, the last part presents the emerging trends and main future directions.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is a common process carried out by groups in a wide variety of situations and contexts. From family activities to business tasks, people typically engage in collaborative search practices while working toward a common goal. In collaborative settings, various aspects of human behavior influence the way people interact with each other and make decisions. One of these aspects corresponds to emotions and related affective processes such as mood and feelings. Studies in social psychology have suggested that group dynamics and their performance may be affected by the interaction of affective processes, in particular positive and negative ones. Although such findings have been derived in different group situations, to the best of our knowledge none of them refer to the particular case of CIS. Based on previous studies, we investigate to what extent positive and negative affective states relate to group performance in CIS. To carry out this study, we designed an experiment with 45 dyads distributed in three configurations based on initial affective states: (1) positive-positive, (2) positive-negative, and (3) negative-negative. To achieve these initial conditions, members of each dyad were individually exposed to affective stimuli. Following, each dyad worked on a precision-oriented search task. Our results suggest that the three interactions of affective states have different implications on the performance of dyads. In particular, the negative-negative configuration performed significantly better than the other two configurations. Conversely, performance of the positive-negative condition was found to be significantly lower than the other two conditions. Findings from this work have practical implications for applications such as team design in tasks involving CIS.

AB  - A recent behavioral study demonstrated that the meaningful interaction of two agents enhances the detection sensitivity of biological motion (BM), however, it remains unclear when and how the 'interaction' information of two agents is represented in our neural system. To clarify this point, we used magnetoencephalography and introduced a novel experimental technique to extract a neuromagnetic response relating to two-agent BM perception. We then investigated how this response was modulated by the interaction of two agents. In the present experiment, we presented two kinds of visual stimuli (interacting and non-interacting BM) with two orientations (upright and inverted).

AB  - Spatial auditory interfaces use three-dimensional sound as an additional display dimension and consist of audio items at different spatial locations. They have evolved significantly in the last couple of years and can be found in a variety of environments where visual communication is obstructed or completely blocked by other activities, such as walking, driving, flying, operating multimodal virtual displays, etc. The precise spatial position of each source can offer an additional informational cue in the interface or can simply help resolving various ambiguities in the content of simultaneously-played sources. It can also be used to increase realism in virtual worlds by imitating real environments where the majority of sounds can be localized and associated with their sources.

JO  - Psychological Research
SP  - 106
EP  - 115
VL  - 77
IS  - 2
AB  - Attention plays a crucial role in the Stroop task, which requires attending to less automatically processed task-relevant attributes of stimuli and the suppression of involuntary processing of task-irrelevant attributes. The experiment assessed the allocation of attention by monitoring eye movements throughout congruent and incongruent trials. Participants viewed two stimulus arrays that differed regarding the amount of items and their numerical value and judged by manual response which of the arrays contained more items, while disregarding their value. Different viewing patterns were observed between congruent (e.g., larger array of numbers with higher value) and incongruent (e.g., larger array of numbers with lower value) trials. The direction of first saccades was guided by task-relevant information but in the incongruent condition directed more frequently towards task-irrelevant information. The data further suggest that the difference in the deployment of attention between conditions changes throughout a trial, likely reflecting the impact and resolution of the conflict. For instance, stimulus arrays in line with the correct response were attended for longer and fixations were longer for incongruent trials, with the second fixation and considering all fixations. By the time of the correct response, this latter difference between conditions was absent. Possible mechanisms underlying eye movement patterns are discussed.

AB  - Weiser’s vision that ubiquitous or pervasive computing will overcome the problem of information overload [1] is on the verge of becoming a reality. The volume of digital images has been increasing dramatically in recent years and as a result a crisis is now taking place within a broad range of disciplines that require and use visual content. While storage and image capture technologies are able to cope with huge numbers of images, poor image and video retrieval is in danger of rendering many repositories valueless because of the difficulty of access. Many disciplines and segments in industry, including telecommunications, entertainment, medicine, and surveillance, need high-performance retrieval systems to function efficiently — and this requirement will grow as we continue moving forward in a world connected by both fixed and wireless networks.

AB  - The experimental results on attentional bias in depression have been contradictory. Research on physiological correlates that validate attentional bias have been scarce. The aim of the present study was to evaluate physiological responses associated with attentional bias in dysphoria. Heart rate and the galvanic skin response were recorded in 30 dysphoric individuals and 30 nondysphoric individuals while they performed an emotional Stroop task. Dysphoric individuals exhibited attentional bias and heart rate deceleration in response to unpleasant words. Nondysphoric individuals exhibited attentional bias toward pleasant words, accompanied by a higher skin conductance response. These results suggest that heart rate deceleration in response to unpleasant words correlated with attentional bias in dysphoric individuals.

AB  - Practitioners in many fields of human-computer interaction are now using physiological data to measure different aspects of user experience. The dynamic nature of physiological data offers a continuous window to the users and allows a better understanding of their experience while interacting with a system. However, in order to be truly informative, physiological signals need to be closely linked to users’ behaviors and interaction states. This paper presents an analysis method that provides a direct visual interpretation of users’ physiological signals when interacting with an interface. The proposed physiological heatmap tool uses eyetracking data along with physiological signals to identify regions where users are experiencing different emotional and cognitive states with a higher frequency. The method was evaluated in an experiment with 44 participants. Results show that physiological heatmaps are able to identify emotionally significant regions within an interface better than standard gaze heatmaps. Applications of the method to different fields of HCI research are also discussed.

VL  - 26
IS  - 5
AB  - The main learning activity provided by intelligent tutoring systems is problem solving, although several recent projects investigated the effectiveness of combining problem solving with worked examples. Previous research has shown that learning from examples is an effective learning strategy, especially for novice learners. A worked example provides step-by-step explanations of how a problem is solved. Many studies have compared learning from examples to unsupported problem solving, and suggested presenting worked examples to students in the initial stages of learning, followed by problem solving once students have acquired enough knowledge. This paper presents a study in which we compare a fixed sequence of alternating worked examples and tutored problem solving with a strategy that adapts learning tasks to students’ needs. The adaptive strategy determines the type of the task (a worked example, a faded example or a problem to be solved) based on how much assistance the student received on the previous problem. The results show that students in the adaptive condition learnt significantly more than their peers who were presented with a fixed sequence of worked examples and problem solving. Novices from the adaptive condition learnt faster than novices from the control group, while the advanced students from the adaptive condition learnt more than their peers from the control group.

As valuable as these studies are for a better understanding of device design and for the fundamentals of human psychomotor performance, they may be of little practical value to the ergonomics analyst who, during design of an interactive system, wishes to predict human performance in a situation of real use. For example, given a task in a 3D CAD/CAM design system such as inputting the parameters for the surface of an object, how long will it take to perform with a mouse? With a joystick? Empirically-based approximations called performance models, which are the topic of this chapter, attempt to answer these questions.

AB  - With the proliferation of MOOCs and the large amount of data collected, a lot of questions have been asked about their value and effectiveness. One of the key issues emerging is the difficulty in the sense—making from the data available. The use of analytic dashboards has been suggested to provide quick insights and distil the large volume of learner interaction data generated. These dashboards hold the promise of providing a contextualized view of data and facilitating useful research exploration. However, little has been done in defining how these dashboards should be created, often resulting in a proliferation of systems for each new research agenda. We present our experience of building MOOC dashboards for two different platforms, namely Coursera and FutureLearn, motivated by a set of design goals with input from a diverse set of stakeholders. We demonstrate the features of the system and how it has served to make data accessible and useable. We report on problems faced, drawing on analyses of think-aloud sessions conducted with real educators, which have informed our dashboard process.

AB  - Five control systems loosely corresponding to primate saccadic, vergence, pursuit, vestibuloocular, and head control operate on a simulated two-eyed robot head maneuvered by a robot arm. The goal is to get some qualitative understanding of the interaction of such reflexes under various assumptions. The simulation is meant to be relevant to U. Rochester’s robot. Thus it incorporates kinematics of the robot head but assumes a ”tool-coordinate” system available to robot arm commands, so that arm kinematic calculations are unnecessary. Dynamics are not modeled, since they are handled by the commercial controllers currently used in the Rochester robot. Even small delays render the effect of delay-free controllers unstable, but multi-delay version of a Smith predictor can to cope with delays. If each controller acts on the predicted system and ignores other controllers, the situation is improved but still potentially unstable if controllers with different delays act on the same control output. The system’s performance is much improved if controllers consider the effect of other controllers, and the resulting system is stable in the presence of a certain amount of stochastic disturbance of control delays and inputs, and also in the presence of systematic error arising from inaccurate plant and world models.

AB  - Differences in social responses of individuals can often be related to differences in functioning of certain neurological mechanisms. Based on a Network-Oriented Modeling approach, a temporal-causal network model has been developed that is capable of showing different types of social response patterns according to such mechanisms, adopted from theories on mirror neuron systems, emotion integration, emotion regulation, and empathy. Within the model also adaptive capabilities have been incorporated, showing how learning of social response patterns can take place. The adaptive temporal-causal network model provides a basis for human-like social response patterns of virtual agents in the context of simulation-based training (e.g., for training of physicians or therapists), gaming, or for generation of virtual stories.

AB  - Learning analytics in formal learning contexts is often restricted to collect and analyze data from students following curricula through a learning management system. In informal learning, however, a deep understanding of learners and entities interacting with each other is needed. The practice of exploring these interactions is known as community learning analytics. Mobile devices, wearables and interconnected Industry 4.0 production machines equipped with a multitude of sensors collecting vast amounts of data are ideal candidates to capture the goals and activities of informal learning settings. What is missing is a methodological approach to collect, manage, analyze and exploit data coming from such an interconnected network of artifacts. In this paper, we present a concept and prototypical implementation of a framework that is able to gather, transform and visualize data coming from Industry 4.0 and wearable sensors and actuators. Our collaborative Web-based visual analytics platform is highly embeddable and extensible on various levels. Its open source availability fosters research on community learning analytics on a broad level.

AB  - Phishing, or the practice of sending deceptive electronic communications to acquire private information from victims, results in significant financial losses to individuals and businesses. The first goal of this study is to identify situational and personality factors that explain why certain individuals are susceptible to such attacks. The second goal is to test those empirically, along with previously identified factors, to explain the likelihood that an individual will fall victim to a phishing attack. We employed the Delphi method to identify seven personality factors that may influence this susceptibility (trust, distrust, curiosity, entertainment drive, boredom proneness, lack of focus, and risk propensity). Our regression model included these as well as variables examined in previous studies. We find that emails sent from a known source significantly increase user susceptibility to phishing, as does a user’s curiosity, risk propensity, general Internet usage, and Internet anxiety. In post hoc tests, we also find that trust and distrust can be significant predictors of susceptibility and that this significance is dependent on the characteristics of the message.

AB  - Two tribes of researchers with quite different cultures and traditions inhabit the upper and lower territories of the event-related potentials (ERP)1 in psychopathology. Shagass (1976) designated them as patho- and psychophysiologists. Their history, with the first settlements under Callaway and Shagass dating back to the early 1960s, has been recently expounded in a number of excellent state-of-the-art reports (e.g., Pritchard 1986; Roth 1987; Shagass 1987, Zahn 1986). Pathophysiologists are best known for their efforts to detect stable abnormalities in the restless squiggles of the early, psychologically still unpolluted ERP that might explain some later deviances in functioning. These early or “exogenous” ERP components depend exclusively or primarily on physical parameters of the stimuli. They are usually observed in the first 10–50 ms after a stimulus, although the border has sometimes been moved to more than 100 ms. The neurophysiological sources of these early components are much better understood than those of the larger “endogenous” or context-dependent components in the rich back-swamps further downstream before the ERP reaches the ocean of background EEG. These are the densely populated territories of the psychophysiologists. Five of the six sections of this review will be devoted to their work.

JO  - Experimental Brain Research

VL  - 208
IS  - 3
AB  - The mechanisms that control eye movements in the antisaccade task are not fully understood. One influential theory claims that the generation of antisaccades is dependent on the capacity of working memory. Previous research also suggests that antisaccades are influenced by the relative processing speeds of the exogenous and endogenous saccadic pathways. However, the relationship between these factors is unclear, in particular whether or not the effect of the relative speed of the pro and antisaccade pathways is mediated by working memory. The present study contrasted the performance of healthy individuals with high and low working memory in the antisaccade and prosaccade tasks. Path analyses revealed that antisaccade errors were strongly predicted by the mean reaction times of prosaccades and that this relationship was not mediated by differences in working memory. These data suggest that antisaccade errors are directly related to the speed of saccadic programming. These findings are discussed in terms of a race competition model of antisaccade control.

AB  - Understanding processes is very important since todays processes are getting more and more complex. Therefore, a visual representation is often helpful. In many cases, the processes are similar and rely on the same components in the same system structure. Current tools lack in particular with respect to the presentation of multiple processes that are based on the same involved structure but slightly differ in the sequence of events. In this paper we introduce a tool for visualizing script-based animated processes. The underlying structure can be reused by only modifying the script containing the process’ events. The highly adaptable visualizations allow a direct and clear view on a process and intuitive functionalities to traverse through its steps. Finally, we show its usage in two case studies from different domains.

EP  - 430
VL  - 46
IS  - 3
AB  - Individuals watch TV shows while simultaneously and/or immediately searching online. Thus, the content of offline TV ads can affect online brand search, a key predictor of sales. Yet there are few insights on the effect of offline ad content on online brand search. We develop hypotheses relating the informational and emotional content of TV ads on online brand search, independently, and in conjunction with two attentional content elements of the ad campaign, prior media publicity and brand website prominence in the TV ad. We test the hypotheses using a quasi-experimental study, the telecast of TV ads on the annual Super Bowl event between 2004 and 2012 (n = 293 observations). We measure online brand search by online brand search lift, i.e., the growth in online brand search following the telecast of the brand’s ad on Super Bowl. The findings indicate that the informational content of the TV ad increases online brand search, while both attentional content elements decrease this effect. We find no support for the effect of emotional content of the TV ad on online brand search. Our findings extend marketing theory on online search and generate managerial implications for designing TV ads to increase online brand search.

AB  - Virtual reality-based rehabilitation systems involving first-person object manipulation need to include representations of the patient’s hands and arms in the virtual environment. The virtual arms and hands should appear in the correct first-person spatial positions to allow natural interaction with the system. Head-mounted displays have cost and motion sickness problems even with healthy subjects, while other methods such as table-top projections have problems with image occlusion by the user’s own limbs. Here we present the first large-scale, age-matched study of a mirrored horizontal display which shows virtual arms in the correct position relative to the user on a table top. We compared it with a conventional display in a questionnaire and a simple arm motor task on 21 sub-acute stroke patients, 14 age-matched healthy subjects and 26 younger healthy subjects. Healthy subjects reported higher ownership of virtual arms using our display and enjoyed it more, while stroke patients preferred the normal display due to comfort reasons but showed no preference in terms of enjoyment. Patients and healthy subjects performed the motor task equally well in the display in either the mirrored or normal positions. We conclude that our display may achieve good acceptance with stroke patients after customization to accommodate patient-specific sitting postures. With these improvements it may become a valuable tool for virtual reality-based arm rehabilitation.

VL  - 77
IS  - 5
AB  - The amount of visual data available on the Web is growing explosively and it is becoming increasingly important to explore methods for automatically estimating the quality of this content in a manner that is consistent with the aesthetic perceptions of humans. The key to this challenging problem is to design an appropriate set of features to extract the aesthetic properties from content. Most previous studies designed a set of aesthetic features based on photographic criteria, which were unavoidably limited to specific examples and they lacked an interpretation based on the mechanism of human aesthetic perception. According to psychological theory, visual complexity is an important property of the stimuli, because it directly influences the viewer’s arousal level, which is believed to be closely related to aesthetic perception. In this study, we propose an alternative set of features for aesthetic estimation based on a visual complexity principle. We extracted the visual complexity properties from an input image in terms of their composition, shape, and distribution. In addition, we demonstrated that the proposed features are consistent with human perception on the complexity in our visual complexity dataset. Next, we employed these features for photo-aesthetic quality estimation using a large-scale dataset. Various experiments were conducted under different conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed visual complexity feature outperforms photography rule-based features and even better than deep features.
