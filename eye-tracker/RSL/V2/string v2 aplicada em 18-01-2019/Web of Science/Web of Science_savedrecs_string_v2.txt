J	Bera, P; Soffer, P; Parsons, J				Bera, Palash; Soffer, Pnina; Parsons, Jeffrey			USING EYE TRACKING TO EXPOSE COGNITIVE PROCESSES IN UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTUAL MODELS	MIS QUARTERLY												Conceptual models are used to communicate information about a domain during the development of information systems. In two experimental studies using business process models, we demonstrate how eye tracking can contribute to understanding the cognitive processes by which readers use conceptual modeling scripts to perform problem solving tasks. In the first study, we compare scripts generated using two process modeling grammars and demonstrate how attention paid to specific parts of scripts generated using grammar variations, and differences in visual association between parts of a diagram, account for task performance. In the second study, we use a combination of eye tracking and verbal protocol analysis to examine how visual association between parts of conceptual modeling scripts can indicate cognitive integration while performing problem solving tasks. The studies show that task performance can be explained with different mental processes, reflected in specific eye tracking behavior, where scripts developed following different rules invoke different cognitive processes. We show that attention can be measured by eye tracking and can explain task performance. In addition, we show that visual association (which is observable) between parts of a modeling script involves cognitive integration (which is not observable). This finding can be used to improve conceptual modeling grammars in several ways, including understanding the effects of alternative visual arrangements of models on how effectively they communicate domain knowledge for particular tasks, and guiding the design of visual modeling notations.																	0276-7783					DEC	2019	43	4					1105	+		10.25300/MISQ/2019/14163							WOS:000504333200003

Activities (tasks) are arranged together into a model (i.e., similar to flowcharts). This study aimed at understanding the underlying structure of PM comprehension. Though standards for describing PM have been defined, the cognitive work load they evoke, their structure, and the efficacy of information transmission are only partially understood. Two studies were conducted to better differentiate the concept of visual literacy (VL) and logical reasoning in interpreting PM. Study I: A total of 1047 students from 52 school classes were assessed. Three different process models of increasing complexity were presented on tablets. Additionally, written labels of the models' elements were randomly allocated to scholars in a 3-group between-subjects design. Comprehension of process models was assessed by a series of 3 x 4 (=12) dichotomous test items. Latent Class Analysis of solved items revealed 6 qualitatively differing solution patterns, suggesting that a single test score is insufficient to reflect participants' performance. Study II: Overall, 21 experts and 15 novices with respect to visual literacy were presented the same set of PMs as in Study I, while wearing eye tracking glasses. The fixation duration on relevant parts of the PM and on questions were recorded, as well as the total time needed to solve all 12 test items. The number of gaze transitions between process model and comprehension questions was measured as well. Being an expert in visual literacy did not alter the capability of correctly understanding graphical logical PMs. Presenting PMs that are labelled by single letters had a significant influence on reducing the time spent on irrelevant model parts but did not affect the fixation duration on relevant areas of interest. Both samples' participants required longer response times with increasing model complexity. The number of toggles (i.e., gaze transitions between model and statement area of interest) was predictive for membership in one of the latent classes. Contrary to expectations, denoting the PM events and decisions not with real-world descriptions, but with single letters, led to lower cognitive workload in responding to comprehension questions and to better results. Visual Literacy experts could neither outperform novices nor high-school students in comprehending PM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Burattin, A; Kaiser, M; Neurauter, M; Weber, B				Burattin, Andrea; Kaiser, Michael; Neurauter, Manuel; Weber, Barbara			Learning process modeling phases from modeling interactions and eye tracking data	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING												The creation of a process model is a process consisting of five distinct phases, i.e., problem understanding, method finding, modeling, reconciliation, and validation. To enable a fine-grained analysis of process model creation based on phases or the development of phase-specific modeling support, an automatic approach to detect phases is needed. While approaches exist to automatically detect modeling and reconciliation phases based on user interactions, the detection of phases without user interactions (i.e., problem understanding, method finding, and validation) is still a problem. Exploiting a combination of user interactions and eye tracking data, this paper presents a two-step approach that is able to automatically detect the sequence of phases a modeler is engaged in during model creation. The evaluation of our approach shows promising results both in terms of quality as well as computation time demonstrating its feasibility.

However, less experienced stakeholders (i.e., novices) face a wide range of issues when trying to read and comprehend these models. In particular, process model comprehension not only requires knowledge on process modeling notations, but also skills to visually and correctly interpret the models. In this context, many unresolved issues concerning the factors hindering process model comprehension exist and, hence, the identification of these factors becomes crucial. Using eye-tracking as an instrument, this paper presents the results obtained of a study, in which we analyzed eye-movements of novices and experts, while comprehending process models expressed in terms of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. Further, recorded eye-movements are visualized as scan paths to analyze the applied comprehension strategies. We learned that experts comprehend process models more effectively than novices. In addition, we observed particular patterns for eye-movements (e.g., back-and-forth saccade jumps) as well as different strategies of novices and experts in comprehending process models.

Especially for domain experts, the comprehension of process models constitutes a challenging task that needs to be mastered when creating or reading these models. This paper presents the results we obtained from an eye tracking experiment on process model comprehension. In detail, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling were confronted with models expressed in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), reflecting different levels of difficulty. The first results of this experiment confirm recent findings from one of our previous experiments on the reading and comprehension of process models. On one hand, independent from their level of expertise, all individuals face similar patterns, when being confronted with process models exceeding a certain level of difficulty. On the other, it appears that process models expressed in terms of EPCs are perceived differently compared to process models specified in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). In the end, their generalization needs to be confirmed by additional empirical experiments. The presented experiment continues a series of experiments that aim to unravel the factors fostering the comprehension of business process models by using methods and theories stemming from the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.

How visual cognition influences process model comprehension	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS												Process analysts and other professionals extensively use process models to analyze business processes and identify performance improvement opportunities. Therefore, it is important that such models can be easily and properly understood. Previous research has mainly focused on two types of factors that are important in this context: (i) properties of the model itself, and (ii) properties of the model reader. The work in this paper aims at determining how the performance of subjects varies across different types of comprehension tasks, which is a new angle. To reason about the complexity of comprehension tasks we take a theoretical perspective that is grounded in visual cognition. We test our hypotheses using a free-simulation experiment that incorporates eye-tracking technology. We find that model-related and person-related factors are fully mediated by variables of visual cognition. More-over, in comparison, visual cognition variables provide a significantly higher explanatory power for the duration and efficiency of comprehension tasks. These insights shed a new perspective on what influences sense-making of process models, shifting the attention from model and reader characteristics to the complexity of the problem solving task at hand. Our work opens the way to investigate and develop effective strategies to support readers of process models, for example through the context-sensitive use of visual cues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Task-specific visual cues for improving process model understanding	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY												Context: Business process models support various stakeholders in managing business processes and designing process-aware information systems. In order to make effective use of these models, they have to be readily understandable. Objective: Prior research has emphasized the potential of visual cues to highlight relevant matters in models such that stakeholders can use them more efficiently. What prior research does not explain is in how far visual cues can be customized to specific understanding tasks and how this influences cognition. Method: In this paper, we address these questions with an experimental research design, in which we use eye-tracking equipment to capture how process experts use models to answer comprehension questions. As a treatment, we designed two manipulations of the secondary notation, namely coloring and layout, to direct attention to the elements relevant for the specific tasks. Results: Our results indicate that both manipulations improve both eye-tracking-based measures and performance measures such as duration and efficiency, with color having the stronger effect. Conclusions: Our findings lay the foundation for novel features of process modeling tools that provide modifications of secondary notation in response to specific user queries. More generally, our research emphasizes the importance of the relevant region associated with a particular model understanding task. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose to combine a continuous, psycho-physiological measurement of cognitive load with a detailed analysis of the modeler's interactions of the modeling environment as well as eye movement analysis to obtain task-specific imposed cognitive load values. We present initial results in terms of a tool, lessons learnt from a pilot study and discuss upcoming challenges. This work provides the basis for investigating task imposed cognitive load during process model creation by enabling a dynamic, semi-automatic analysis of cognitive load.

It is a major concern for industry and research, having process models are at its core. The paper approaches controlled experiments that employ eye-tracking as the observation method, for researching process model understanding. Previous research in the field, was conducted using only indirect observation methods. Eye-tracking was employed in several related fields, from which we distill the major points of interest related to experimental design (e.g. metrics, tasks, participant selection, etc.). The main contribution of the paper is a set of guidelines based on the state-of-the-art review, and our own experience with eye-tracking based controlled experiments.																	2284-7472						2015							128	134									WOS:000362796900022

Successful assistive technology service delivery outcomes from applying a person-centered systematic assessment process: a case study	LIFE SPAN AND DISABILITY												Background. The assistive technology assessment (ATA) process developed by Federici and Scherer in 2012 provides professionals with guidelines for effective outcomes in assistive technology (AT) selection and assignment process with the aim to match a person with AT. Purpose. This paper has sought to verify the effectiveness of the ATA process model through its application in a centre for technical aids in severe motor disability cases. Method. The ATA process was applied to a case study of a 6.5-year-old female child with cerebral palsy during a period of three years. The process consisted of three 12-monthcycles of AT assessment, matching, and assignment. The first cycle focused on the evaluation of the user's requests and the assistive solution assessments, while the last two cycles focused on the post-assignation follow-up, and re-evaluation of the previous solutions by fine-tuning AT assignations. Results: After several multidisciplinary team meetings and an environmental evaluation, the child was provided with an E-Tran, a scanning system utilizing Clicker software, a new postural system, and eye-tracking system solution. The ATA process model guided the centre's professionals and the user's milieu to better analysis and comprehension of the user's needs. The effectiveness of the ATA process was highlighted by the user's improvement in autonomy, social integration and communication, and in oculi-motor and postural control. Conclusions: This case study highlights how a multidisciplinary and user-focused assessment process is effective over time. The roles of the psycho-technologist and the psychologist throughout the phases of the ATA process emerged as fundamentally important to reach an effective outcome in an ATA process.

This article focuses on the interdisciplinary combination of three methods - iconology, a qualitative method of visual analysis targeted at the meanings of visuals and based in the humanities, and eye-tracking and psychophysiological reaction measurement, both based in experimental psychology. The authors propose a Visual Communication Process Model as an integrative means for connecting different facets of the communication processes involved in visual mass communication. The goal of this new model is to widen and sharpen the focus on explaining (a) meaning-attribution processes, (b) visual perception and attention processes, and (c) psychophysiological reactions to mass-mediated visuals, illustrated in this article with examples of press photography.
