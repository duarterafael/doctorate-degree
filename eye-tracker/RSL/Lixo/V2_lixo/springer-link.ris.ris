AB  - Visual attention is, as mentioned in the introduction, the selective process that enables us to act effectively in our complex environment. The term attention is common in everyday language and familiar to everyone. Nevertheless - or even therefore - it is necessary to clarify and define the term properly. Since visual attention is a concept of human perception, it is important to understand the underlying visual processing in the brain and to know about the psychophysical and neuro-biological findings in this field.

AB  - Experiences of visual imagery, the ability to see in the mind’s eye, occur in various situations. The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) has been widely used to subjectively measure the vividness of visualizers based on its score. For objective measurements, studies show that functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can be used to measure individual variabilities of the vividness of visual imagery. However, questions are remained on how the visualizers see the images spatially. This study proposes a method to measure the spatial distribution of gaze in 3-dimensional space of an object seen by a visualizer using a glass-typed 3D eye tracker. The eye tracker estimated gaze in 3D based on vergence eye movements. Thus, if the visualizer reports good visual imagery of a given image, the eye tracker will be able to estimate the location of the object in 3-dimensional space. The eye tracker is equipped with polarizing lenses to enable the visualizer to see the given stimuli in both virtual and real worlds. Here, a 3D television (3DTV) is used to present the stimuli virtually. Ten introductory students completed the VVIQ and divided into two groups: high and low vividness visualizers, based on total scores of the VVIQ. Experiment results show that 3D gaze fixations of subjects who reported good visual imagery were relatively distributed around the location of the given stimuli.

AB  - Development and performance evaluation of efficient methods for coding, transmission, and quality assessment of 3D visual content require rich datasets of a suitable test material. The use of these databases allows a fair comparison of systems under test. Moreover, publicly available and widely used datasets are crucial for experimentation leading to reproducible research. This chapter presents an overview of 3D visual content datasets relevant to research in the field of coding, transmission, and quality assessment. Description of regular stereoscopic or multiview image and video datasets is presented. Databases created using emerging technologies, including light-field imaging, are also addressed. Moreover, there are databases of multimedia content annotated with ratings from the subjective experiment, which are a necessary resource for understanding the complex problem of quality of experience while consuming the 3D visual content.

TI  - 3D visual saliency detection model with generated disparity map
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 3087
EP  - 3103
VL  - 76
IS  - 2
AB  - Due to the remarkable distinction between human monocular vision and binocular vision, stereoscopic visual attention becomes an emerging question in the study of 3D applications. Some of existing 3D visual saliency detection models take advantage of ground-truth disparity map to compute center-surround differences of the depth features with high computational cost. In some 3D applications, the ground-truth disparity map may not be always available. In this paper, an efficient and simple 3D visual saliency detection model is proposed without using ground-truth disparity map. The proposed model is based on a band-pass filtering method which coincides with the visual perceptual process in human visual system. Firstly, the monocular luminance, color and texture features are extracted from the left view’s image; the binocular depth feature is extracted from the two views’ disparity map. Then, all the feature maps are filtered to generate three types of saliency maps, i.e., 2D saliency map, texture saliency map and depth saliency map. Subsequently, the three saliency maps are fused to one 3D saliency map by a linear pooling strategy. Finally, the final 3D visual saliency map is enhanced by the center-bias factor. Experimental results on a public eye tracking database show that the proposed model achieves better detection performance with low computational cost among the existing 3D visual saliency detection models.

SP  - 300
EP  - 318
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The ability of head-up displays (HUDs) to present information within the usual viewpoint of the user has led to a quick adoption in domains where attention is crucial, such as in the car. As HUDs employ 3D technology, further opportunities emerge: information can be structured and positioned in 3D space thus allowing important information to be perceived more easily and information can be registered with objects in the visual scene to communicate a relationship. This allows novel user interfaces to be built. As of today, however, no prototyping tools exist, that allow 3D UIs for HUDs to be sketched and tested prior to development. To close this gap, we report on the design and development of the 3D Head-Up Display Designer (3D-HUDD). In addition, we present an evaluation of the tool with 24 participants, comparing different input modalities and depth management modes.

TI  - A Bag of Strings Representation for Image Categorization
JO  - Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision
SP  - 51
EP  - 67
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper presents an architecture well suited for natural images classification or visual object recognition applications. The method proposes to integrate a spatial representation into the well known “bag of local signatures” approach. For this purpose, it combines the power of a string representation which provides an ordered view of local features with the vectorial histogram representation allowing to recognize efficiently and quickly an image by using a machine learning classifier. To reach this goal, we propose to represent an image by a set of strings of local signatures obtained by tracking the detected salient points along image edges. We propose here to conjointly use the Hölder exponents and the direction of minimal regularity of the bidimensional signal singularities to compute a signature describing precisely a region of interest centered on an interest point. As we will see, an alphabet of strings is easily obtained by using a typical self organizing map architecture. As a consequence, a “bag of strings” representation is used, providing a compact representation encoding both local signatures and spatial information. This representation is particularly well suited to train a support vector machine classifier used for the last classification step. This architecture obtains good classification rates on different well known datasets.

AB  - Research and development of autonomous driving technology is accelerating in the automotive industry. Currently, drivers of such vehicles are considered to pay less attention to environmental conditions while being driven, due to potential overestimations of autonomous driving functionality and its reliability. In this paper, methods to quantitatively measure the driver’s gaze behavior are proposed, followed by investigation methodology and results on how auditory warning signals influence the behavior, where the difference between novice and experienced drivers is also compared.

AB  - Robots often incorporate computational models of visual attention to streamline processing. Even though the number of visual attention systems employed on robots has increased dramatically in recent years, the evaluation of these systems has remained primarily qualitative and subjective. We introduce quantitative methods for evaluating computational models of visual attention by direct comparison with gaze trajectories acquired from humans. In particular, we focus on the need for metrics based not on distances within the image plane, but that instead operate at the level of underlying features. We present a framework, based on dimensionality-reduction over the features of human gaze trajectories, that can simultaneously be used for both optimizing a particular computational model of visual attention and for evaluating its performance in terms of similarity to human behavior. We use this framework to evaluate the Itti et al. (1998) model of visual attention, a computational model that serves as the basis for many robotic visual attention systems.

AB  - A longitudinal study of two non-speech continuous cursor control systems is presented in this paper: Whistling User Interface (U3I) and Vocal Joystick (VJ). This study combines the quantitative and qualitative methods to get a better understanding of novice users’ experience over time. Three hypotheses were tested in this study. The quantitative data show that U3I performed better in error rate and in simulating a mouse click; VJ was better on other measures. The qualitative data indicate that the participants’ opinions regarding both tools improved day-by-day. U3I was perceived as less fatiguing than VJ. U3I approached the performance of VJ at the end of the study period, indicating that these two systems can achieve similar performances as users get more experienced in using them. This study supports two hypotheses but does not provide enough evidence to support one hypothesis.

SP  - 111
EP  - 134
PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - Inference about high-level cognitive states during interaction is a fundamental task in building proactive intelligent systems that would allow effective offloading of mental operations to a computational architecture. We introduce an improved machine-learning pipeline able to predict user interactive behavior and performance using real-time eye-tracking. The inference is carried out using a support-vector machine (SVM) on a large set of features computed from eye movement data that are linked to concurrent high-level behavioral codes based on think aloud protocols. The differences between cognitive states can be inferred from overt visual attention patterns with accuracy over chance levels, although the overall accuracy is still low. The system can also classify and predict performance of the problem-solving users with up to 79 % accuracy. We suggest this prediction model as a universal approach for understanding of gaze in complex strategic behavior. The findings confirm that eye movement data carry important information about problem solving processes and that proactive systems can benefit from real-time monitoring of visual attention.

AB  - Data-driven knowledge discovery is becoming a new trend in various scientific fields. In light of this, the goal of the present paper is to introduce a novel framework to study one interesting topic in cognitive and behavioral studies – multimodal communication between human-human and human-robot interaction. We present an overall solution from data capture, through data coding and validation, to data analysis and visualization. In data collection, we have developed a multimodal sensing system to gather fine-grained video, audio and human body movement data. In data analysis, we propose a hybrid solution based on visual data mining and information-theoretic measures. We suggest that this data-driven paradigm will lead not only to breakthroughs in understanding multimodal communication, but will also serve as a successful case study to demonstrate the promise of data-intensive discovery which can be applied in various research topics in cognitive and behavioral studies.

AB  - Visual deficits have been discovered in sufferers of Parkinson’ disease [1] and the cause of this is not clearly understood. This paper reports on a digital neuromodel that investigates a hypothesis that the deficit may be due to a projection from the Basal Ganglia to the Superior Colliculus where a shortage of Dopamine introduces noise in the oculo-motor loop. New experiments were done with Parkinson’s patients to track the deficit and the neuromodel predicts performance against oculo-motor noise. It is seen that a group Parkinson’s sufferers in whom the deficit is pronounced follow the predicted law, while controls with poor performance do not follow the law. This helps to uphold the noise hypothesis.

EP  - 183
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Nowadays, designers of Virtual Reality (VR) applications are faced with the choice of a large number of different input and output devices leading to a growing number of interaction techniques. Usually VR interaction techniques are described informally, based on the actions users can perform within the VR environment. At implementation time, such informal descriptions (made at design time) yield to ambiguous interpretations by the developers. In addition, informal descriptions make it difficult to foresee the impact throughout the application of a modification of the interaction techniques. This paper discusses the advantages of using a formal description technique (called ICO) to model interaction techniques and dialogues for VR applications. This notation is presented via a case study featuring an immersive VR application. The case study is then used to show, through analysis of models, how the formal notation can help to ensure the usability, reliability and efficiency of virtual reality systems.

Existing model transformation languages, however, lack appropriate abstraction mechanisms for resolving recurring kinds of structural heterogeneities one has to primarily cope with when creating such mappings.

SP  - 295
EP  - 312
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Informal interactions are a key element of workgroup communication, but have proven difficult to support in distributed groups. One reason for this is that existing systems have focused either on novel means for gathering information about the availability or activity of others, or on allowing people to display their activities to others. There has not been sufficient focus on the interplay between these activities. This interplay is important, however, because mutual awareness and attention are the mechanisms by which people negotiate the start of conversations. In this paper, we present the OpenMessenger Framework, a system and design framework rooted in the assumption that individual behaviors occur in anticipation of and/or in response to the behavior of others. We describe both the system architecture, and specific examples of the novel implementations it enables. These include techniques for coupling gathering behaviors with display behaviors, and for integrating these into user workspaces via peripheral displays and gaze tracking.

Experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the method was achieved on challenging databases containing facial images acquired under different lighting conditions and with different scales and poses.

AB  - In a video surveillance system the object tracking is one of the most challenging problem. In fact objects in the world exhibit complex interactions. When captured in a video sequence, some interactions manifest themselves as occlusions. A visual tracking system must be able to track objects which are partially or even fully occluded. In this paper we present a novel method of tracking objects through occlusions using a multi-resolution representation of the moving regions. The matching between objects in two consecutive frames to recognize the trajectories is preformed in a graph theoretic approach. The experimental results on the standard database PEST2001 show that the approach looks promising.

CY  - Cham
AB  - A virtual avatar or autonomous agent is a digital representation of a human being that can be controlled by either a human or an artificially intelligent computer system. Increasingly avatars are becoming realistic virtual human characters that exhibit human behavioral traits, body language and eye and head movements. As the interpretation of eye and head movements represents an important part of nonverbal human communication it is extremely important to accurately reproduce these movements in virtual avatars to avoid falling into the well-known “uncanny valley”. In this paper we present a cheap hybrid real-time head and eye tracking system based on existing open source software and commonly available hardware. Our evaluation indicates that the system of head and eye tracking is stable and accurate and can allow a human user to robustly puppet a virtual avatar, potentially allowing us to train an A.I. system to learn realistic human head and eye movements.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye movement is an important characteristic in the field of image processing and psychology, which reflects people’s attention bias. How to design a paradigm with the function of psychological discrimination to extract significant eye movement characteristic is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel psychology evaluation system with eye tracking. Negative and positive background images from IAPS and Google are chosen based on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Meanwhile, negative and positive face images are used as emotional foreground. The location of the face images is shown on the left or right randomly. In this paradigm, people with different psychological status have different characteristics of eye movement length, fixation points and response time. The experimental results show that these characteristics have significant discriminability and can be used to distinguish depressed and normal people effectively.

AB  - In order to understand the emotional information of the color image, research focus has been shifted from designing sophisticated low-level feature extraction algorithms to reducing the ‘semantic gap’ between the visual features and the richness of human perception. In this paper, we firstly get the ROI using the Eye tracker and divide every image into two regions including Regions of Interest (ROI) and Non- Regions of Interest (Non-ROI). Secondly, we use the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to provide a systematical way to evaluate the fit weights of ROI and Non-ROI. Finally, using the improved GLCM, we extract the texture feature of the two regions including ROI and Non-ROI, and get the whole texture feature. The algorithm is tested that the average detection rate of the proposed method is up to the same method using GLCM.

AB  - The creation of a model for the interpretation and transformation of data from the computer of automobiles (ECU) will serve on a large scale to the automotive sector. The main objective of this work is to facilitate the understanding of the data provided by the ECU of automobiles, through a model composed of five phases (Connection, loading, interpretation, loading and visualization). The model has usability criteria. Each phase is comprised of the most convenient processes for the context, seeking to reduce complexity and inefficiency. Finally, with the application of the proposed model in mobile applications or desktop software, a person can perform an automotive “Diagnostic” with or without mechanical knowledge, will be able to understand and interpret the information provided and will have certainty about the mechanical state of the revised automobile.

AB  - This paper presents a model of perceptual task effort for use in hypothesizing the message that a bar chart is intended to convey. It presents our rules, based on research by cognitive psychologists, for estimating perceptual task effort, and discusses the results of an eye tracking experiment that demonstrates the validity of our model. These rules comprise a model that captures the relative difficulty that a viewer would have performing one perceptual task versus another on a specific bar chart. The paper outlines the role of our model of relative perceptual task effort in recognizing the intended message of an information graphic. Potential applications of this work include using this message to provide (1) a more complete representation of the content of the document to be used for searching and indexing in digital libraries, and (2) alternative access to the information graphic for visually impaired users or users of low-bandwidth environments.

AB  - One of the most important tasks on the Web is foraging information. In this study, we present a computational model which simulates human eye movements during information seeking in Web pages. Human visual scanpaths are guided by their information needs, by the visual features of the stimuli and by what they previously processed. Our model takes into account both semantic (top-down) and visual (bottom-up) information, as well as a memory model in order to predict the focus of attention. Our model operates at the block level, but also at the word level. To validate this model, both participants and model were asked to seek information in a pseudo online newspaper. We find good correspondence between simulated and empirically observed scanpaths. Knowing where the user is looking at while searching for information is crucial for evaluating the usability of Web sites and contribute to the design of Web pages.

For each site, page content and colour of presentation (colour versus black & white) were manipulated. Results support the utility and diversity of these measures. Each provided information about users’ responses to web page designs, with a good deal of variation in sensitivity to experimental manipulations. In combination the data from these measures allowed further inferences to be drawn, supporting a multi-dimensional view of user experience and the need for multi-method approaches to evaluation.

SP  - 55

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Dispatcher’s error is an important factor affecting the safe operation of power system. One of the main causes of human error is inappropriate workload. Due to the particularity of the power dispatching work process, existing workload measures are not ideal for power dispatcher. According to the human information processing model, combined with the actual work of dispatchers, this article proposed a novel method for dispatcher workload assessment. It considered dispatcher’s workload from four dimensions: information perception, speech output, action output and attention. Video, audio and physiological monitor were deployed to acquire descriptive features. The frequency of incoming calls was extracted to describe information perception. Short-term energy and spectral entropy of the speech signal were extracted to describe speech output. Body movement speed was extracted to describe action output and heart rate was used to describe attention. The method was applied to an experiment in the dispatcher training simulator involving qualified power dispatchers. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was applicable and it can effectively reflect changes of dispatcher’s workload during troubleshooting tasks.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Recognizing subtle emotional expression of human is a challenging and interesting problem in the field of human computer interaction. Multimodality is a prospective way to help solve this problem. Therefore, in this paper, we first take advantage of a novel “sparse representation” approach to compute the matching degree of current facial expression to each basic emotion class. Concurrently, we also use an eye tracker to obtain the instant pupillary response, which gives us clues to the subtle emotion. We combine the results of facial expression and pupillary information, take into account the previous emotional state to classify the current subtle emotional expression. Finally, a Markov Model is used to compute a directed graph to model the changes of human’s emotion. The experimental results show that: First, the sparse representation has a good classification rate on facial expression; Second, the fusion of facial expression, pupillary size and previous emotional state is a promising strategy for analyzing subtle expression.

AB  - Explicit relevance feedback requires the user to explicitly refine the search queries for content-based image retrieval. This may become laborious or even impossible due to the ever-increasing volume of digital databases. We present a multimodal information collector that can unobtrusively record and asynchronously transmit the user’s implicit relevance feedback on a displayed image to the remote CBIR server for assisting in retrieving relevant images. The modalities of user interaction include eye movements, pointer tracks and clicks, keyboard strokes, and audio including speech. The client-side information collector has been implemented as a browser extension using the JavaScript programming language and has been integrated with an existing CBIR server. We verify its functionality by evaluating the performance of the gaze-enhanced CBIR system in on-line image tagging tasks.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - A better understanding of the human user’s expectations and sensitivities to the real-time behavior generated by virtual agents can provide insightful empirical data and infer useful principles to guide the design of intelligent virtual agents. In light of this, we propose and implement a research framework to systematically study and evaluate different important aspects of multimodal real-time interactions between humans and virtual agents. Our platform allows the virtual agent to keep track of the user’s gaze and hand movements in real time, and adjust his own behaviors accordingly. Multimodal data streams are collected in human-avatar interactions including speech, eye gaze, hand and head movements from both the human user and the virtual agent, which are then used to discover fine-grained behavioral patterns in human-agent interactions. We present a pilot study based on the proposed framework as an example of the kinds of research questions that can be rigorously addressed and answered. This first study investigating human-agent joint attention reveals promising results about the role and functioning of joint attention in human-avatar interactions.

AB  - Although there has been a tremendous progress in recent years in 3-D, immersive display and virtual reality (VR) technologies, the corresponding interface technologies have lagged behind. To fully exploit the potential that VR offers as a means of visualizing and interacting with complex information, it is important to develop “natural” means for interacting with the virtual display. Such natural interaction can be achieved by using an integrated approach where multiple, possibly redundant modes of input such as speech, hand gesture, gaze, and graphical feedback are used simultaneously. This paper presents a conceptual framework for multimodal human-computer interaction for manipulating a virtual object. Specific techniques are presented for using a combination of speech and gesture for manipulating virtual objects. Free hand gestures are analyzed and recognized using computer vision. The gesture analysis is done cooperatively with the speech recognition system and the graphic system. This is demonstrated with the help of an experimental VR setup used by molecular biologists for simulating and visualizing complex molecular structures.

AB  - User attention recognition in front of a monitor or a specific task is a crucial issue in many applications, ranging from e-learning to driving. Visual input is very important when extracting information regarding a user’s attention when recorded with a camera. However, intrusive equipment (special helmets, glasses equipped with cameras recording the eye movements, etc.) impose constraints on users spontaneity, especially when the target group consists of under aged users. In this paper, we propose a system for inferring user attention (state) in front of a computer monitor, only with the usage of a simple camera. The system can be used for real time applications and does not need calibration in terms of camera parameters. It can function under normal lighting conditions and needs no adaptation for each user.

AW index was estimated for two groups of ten paintings of Titian: one group was related to religious matter while the second was related to portraits. In addition, it was compared the population AW indexes estimated in the first 10 seconds of the observation across all the selected paintings with the AW index estimated in the last 40 seconds of the observation. The number and the total duration (in seconds) spent on the eye fixations performed by the subjects during the observation of the paintings was also analyzed.

AB  - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems capable of decoding neural activity in real time, thereby allowing a computer application to be directly controlled by the brain. Since the characteristics of such direct brain-to-computer interaction are limited in several aspects, one major challenge in BCI research is intelligent front-end design. Here we present the mental text entry application ‘Hex-o-Spell’ which incorporates principles of Human-Computer Interaction research into BCI feedback design. The system utilises the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the extremely limited control bandwidth which operates with only two mental states, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. The display is visually appealing, and control is robust. The effectiveness and robustness of the interface was demonstrated at the CeBIT 2006 (world’s largest IT fair) where two subjects operated the mental text entry system at a speed of up to 7.6 char/min.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often have difficulty functioning independently and display impairments related to important tasks related to adaptive independence such as driving. Ability to drive is believed to be an important factor of quality of life for individuals with ASD. The presented work describes a novel driving simulator based on a virtual city environment that will be used in the future to impart driving skills to teenagers with ASD as a part of intervention. A physiological data acquisition system, which was used to acquire and process participant’s physiological signals, and an eye tracker, which was utilized to detect eye gaze signals, were each integrated into the driving simulator. These physiological and eye gaze indices were recorded and computed to infer the affective states of the participant in real-time when he/she was driving. Based on the affective states of the participant together with his/her performance, the driving simulator adaptively changes the difficulty level of the task. This VR-based driving simulator will be capable of manipulating the driving task difficulty in response to the physiological and eye gaze indices recorded during the task. The design of this novel driving simulator system and testing data to validate its functionalities are presented in this paper.

AB  - Results from prior experiments suggested that measuring immersion objectively (using eye trackers) can be a very important supplement to subjective tests (with questionnaires). But, traditional eye trackers are not usable together with VR HMDs (Head Mounted Displays) because they cannot “see” an audience’s eyes occluded by helmets. The eye trackers compatible with HMDs are not easily accessible to students, researchers and developers in small studios because of the high prices. This paper explores a novel way of estimating a user’s focus of attention in a virtual environment. An experiment measuring the relationship between subject’s head movement and eyesight was conducted to investigate whether eye movement can be closely approximated by head rotation. The findings suggested that people’s eyesight tended to remain in the central area of the HMD when playing a VR game and the HMD orientation data was very close to the eyesight direction. And therefore, this novel way that employs no other equipment than HMDs themselves can hopefully be used to estimate a user’s focus of attention in a much more economic and convenient manner.

AB  - Tracking eye movements to control technical systems is becoming increasingly popular; the use of eye movements to direct a cursor in human-computer interaction (HCI) is particularly convenient and caters for both healthy and disabled users alike. However, it is often difficult to find an appropriate substitute for the click operation, especially within the context of hands-free interaction. The most common approach is the use of dwell-times, but this can lead to the so-called “Midas-Touch” problem. This problem is defined by the fact that the system incorrectly interprets fixations due to long processing times or spontaneous dwellings as a user command. The current study explores the event-related potentials (ERPs) that might indicate a user’s intention to select. Therefore, Electroencephalography (EEG) data was recorded from 10 participants during an interaction with a dwell-time system within a selection process. The aim was to identify EEG potentials related to the intention to interact (i.e. the selection of targets on a screen) and to classify these against EEG potentials unrelated to interaction during random fixations on the screen. As a result, we found a clear negativity over parietal electrodes for the intention of item selection. This negativity did not occur when participant fixated an object without intention to select (no specific intention). We robustly could classify the underlying brain activity in most of our participants with an average accuracy of 81%. The presented study provides evidence that the intention to interact evokes EEG activity that can clearly be detected by passive BCI technology. This leads to a new type of implicit interaction that holds the potential to improve human-machine interaction by increasing efficiency and making it more intuitive.

AB  - Robotic ecologies are networks of heterogeneous devices (sensors, actuators, automated appliances and mobile robots) pervasively embedded in everyday environments, where they cooperate to the achievement of complex tasks. Their successful application opens important research questions for both their engineering and their interaction with human users. In this paper we illustrate a testbed built to support interaction studies between human users and robotic ecologies. The testbed consists of an interactive and autonomous robotic ecology that is able to engage with human users, react to their activities, and even introduce them to the main concepts behind robotic ecologies. We describe how such a testbed is built using a middleware purposefully designed for robotic ecologies, and we report our experiences in its application to a number of project demonstrations and human-robot interaction studies.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye tracking has been shown to be an effective method for evaluating usability and User eXperience (UX) in various environments. With the advent of affordable high performance Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), Virtual Reality (VR) has rapidly expanded and opened new channels for fun and “serious” game experiences. However, there is a lack of effective quality indicators that measure satisfaction, frustration, boredom, or attention of users immersed in VR environments. Traditional approaches such as questionnaires, surveys, and interviews can easily interfere with the user’s sense of presence if the assessment is performed while the experience is in progress. If performed after completing the experience, users are forced to recall memories that may be incomplete or inaccurate. In this context, the integration of eye tracking technology into HMDs provides a reliable and non-intrusive mechanism to assess UX and feed real-time data which can be used to design and develop adaptive VR experiences. In this paper, we discuss the assessment capabilities of eye tracking technologies in immersive VR environments and describe strategies to apply this information to the creation of VR games that can adapt to the player’s performance, mood and behavior.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Personnel Selection has been a long standing focus in the fields of Organizational Psychology, Human Factors Psychology, Business Management, Human Resources, and Industrial Engineering. Assessment methods in personnel selection can be categorized into subjective and objective methods. Selection assessments are often broad in attempting to capture the essence of person for success in a role or organization. However, this type of approach often yields inconclusive and biased subjective results. Therefore, focusing on key skills seems to be more beneficial. The skill of focus for this effort is decision making. Since those who make more good decisions are often influential and rise to leadership positions, it is imperative that better ways to uncover, assess, predict, or enhance DM skills, be developed. To do so, a review and firm understanding of personnel selection and decision making is necessary.

AB  - Innovative educational technologies have started to open new ways of interacting with students with special educational needs (SEN). Amongst the most effective approaches during the last decade (2001-2010) are those based on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) techniques. The effective application of A.I. methods is seen as a means of improving the quality of life of SEN learners. Hence, a need for introducing A.I. techniques arises in order to develop both diagnosis and intervention processes. This paper presents a brief overview of the most representative studies of the past ten years, used for the above purposes.

BT  - Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality
SP  - 736
EP  - 745
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Many science education materials exhibit simplified models of nature. This simplification is beneficial to represent the essential characteristics of nature, but it forces the learners to cognitively assign the model to reality. This paper describes a traditional content exhibiting the lunar phase, which is taught in the elementary school. The use of multiple frames of observation and the necessity of dual concept required for perceiving the lunar orbital motion and Earth’s rotational motion around its axis creates an extraneous cognitive load. This study introduces a simple desktop model of the planets and a multi-view display of the model planets using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Eye-tracking experiments are performed to examine the role of AR to intermediate between the spatial arrangement of real objects and the VR display observed from a fixed position on an object that represents the Earth. The results indicate that participants who experimented with the desktop model took more time to check and move their eye gaze between AR, VR, and the real model, in the beginning phase of the trials. Therefore, it is suggested that AR intermediates cognition of a view outside of the orbit and a surface of the Earth.

AB  - Many eye-tracking systems either require the user to keep their head still or involve cameras or other equipment mounted on the user’s head. While acceptable for research applications, these limitations make the systems unsatisfactory for prolonged use in interactive applications. Since the goal of our work is to use eye trackers for improved visual communication through gaze guidance [1,2] and for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) [3], we are interested in less invasive eye tracking techniques.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Recent advances in computer and robotic technology are enabling the application of such technology in assisting traditional intervention in developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A number of research studies indicate that many children with ASD prefer technology and this preference can be explored to develop systems that may alleviate several challenges of traditional treatment and intervention. The current work proposes to develop an adaptive virtual reality-based social interaction platform for children with ASD. It is hypothesized that endowing a technological system that can detect the feeling and state of the child and adapt its interaction accordingly is of great importance in assisting and individualization of traditional intervention approaches. The proposed system employs sensors such as eye trackers and physiological signal monitors and models the context relevant psychological state of the user from combination of these sensors together with the performance of the participant.

AB  - This paper presents a new strategy for localization and recognition of graphical entities in handwritten chemical formulas. The first part of the paper describes the context of this study. Next, the tools and methods needed for the automatic interpretation are defined. Our system includes a first phase of global perception of the document followed by a phase of incremental extraction of the sentation of the drawing and provides a precise description of all the shapes present in the initial image. Thereafter, this representation constitutes the main resource that will be used by different processes (specialists) achieving the interpretation of the drawing. The knowledge extracted from the intermediary representation (a structural graph) is used instead of the bitmap image material to drive the interpretation process.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper discusses the SitAdapt 2.0 development approach for constructing adaptive interactive systems. Resulting applications provide situation-awareness and respond to changing contexts, environments, user emotions, and biometric signals. An observer component is watching the user during interaction with the system. The adaptation process is triggered by situation changes or the recognition of new situations. The necessary software modifications are established in real-time by activating situation rules and exploiting the pattern- and model-based resources of the PaMGIS development framework for model based user interface development. It is shown in detail, how the adaptation process exploits the different PaMGIS models before and during runtime. The SitAdapt approach may also serve for finding user personas, optimizing user experience, and allowing for individualized digital marketing activities. The approach is currently being evaluated for applications from the e-business domain.

AB  - Makepeace in his 1998 article describes how enjoyment and pleasure also factor into the function of an object [1]. Since visual impression is the first occurrence of visual perception, and all human visual experiences are determined by design, the quality of product design is closely associated with the effect an object has on a viewer and may determine their understanding and experience of it. Since China will have the most aged population in the world by 2050, this study takes into consideration the rapidly growing elderly population globally and how currently design practice ignores the changing perceptual habits caused by physical aging. It explores the necessity of evaluating these changes, and the relationship between the visual experience and emotional reflection. A data collection methodology, comprised of two analytical assessment tools, was utilized to determine results. The first approach, Tasting Board System (TBS), was created by the author to gauge subjective preferences. The second, Eye Tracking (ET) Device, evaluates objective reflection. The results of the study identify the common cognitive features of the elderly so that it may positively affect design practice and enhance pleasurable visual experience.

AB  - The diversity of information interaction is constantly expanding, a variety of information interaction and cultural exchanges have changed people’s behavior patterns. This paper based on the pressure sensitivity of the 3D touch technology, we made a real-time measurement of the pressure, time interval and other physical quantities of users when they press the screen to enter the information, and obtained the users’real-time emotion information combined with semantic recognition, then added it to the text by way of color, font and so on, which can solve the problem of semantic misunderstanding caused by the single expression of the information in text sequence communication, so that communication is more smooth and diversified. Therefore, This paper explores how to overcome the difference of cultural exchange by using the multiple ways of emotional interaction, aiming to build a more effective and effective way of information interaction mode.

AB  - Upon entry into the digital age, the number and importance of images in media has increased considerably. This paper discusses the similarities and differences between implicit and explicit memory produced by the subjective perception of time when viewing images and text in advertisements. The durations involved in implicit memory were measured using scientific instrumentation (eye-tracking devices), while explicit memory was gauged via a self-administered questionnaire. Three out of ten subjects retrospectively perceived browsing times that differed from the actual times measured through eye tracking, indicating a difference between implicit observation and explicit memory. We also investigated the layout preferences of subjects with various backgrounds in terms of images, text, and logos. These results could assist advertisers to enhance the effectiveness of communication regarding content as well as brand recognition through the use of strong narrative methods.

Inspired by psychological findings that human visual behavior is tightly dependent on the executed tasks, we carefully design specific tasks in accordance with the contents of 111 images covering various semantic categories, such as text, facial expression, texture, pose, and gaze. It results in a dataset of 111 fixation density maps and over 5,000 scanpaths. Moreover, we provide baseline results of thirteen state-of-the-art saliency models. Furthermore, we hold discussions on important clues on how tasks and image contents influence human visual behavior. This task-driven eye tracking dataset with the fixation density maps and scanpaths will be made publicly available.

In the context of website evaluation tools, providing a structured way for researchers and practitioners to compare and analyze existing solutions is valuable for identifying gaps/trends or to support well-informed decisions during development cycles (from planning to deployment). This paper proposes a taxonomy for classifying website evaluation tools grounded on Semiotic Framework, an artifact from Organizational Semiotics. The taxonomy is structured into 4 main dimensions (i.e., Participant-evaluator interaction; Effort; Automation type; Data source) and considers interaction and efforts involving UI evaluation stakeholders. From the proposed taxonomy, we expect to support consistent characterization of website evaluation tools.

SP  - 151

PB  - Springer US
CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - In this chapter we introduce a theory for the optimal bit allocation between displacement vector field (DVF) and displaced frame difference (DFD) for region-based motion compensated video coders [184, 185]. The proposed scheme is based on the optimal region matching algorithm presented in section 5.1. The optimal region matching algorithm finds the DVF which results in the smallest DFD energy for a given maximum rate for encoding the DVF. In this chapter we extend this scheme to include the quantizer selection so that the resulting distortion of the reconstructed frame is minimized for a given total bit rate. As before, the DVF is encoded which results in the DVF bit rate, but now the quantized DFD is also encoded and hence the total bit rate is the sum of the DVF rate and the DFD rate.

AB  - It has been well established that adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) present social and behavioral characteristics that differ significantly from those of their peers without ASD. A growing number of recent studies have begun to look closely at automobile operation characteristics in individuals diagnosed with ASD. Some of this work has suggested that certain driving behaviors demonstrated by those with ASD may pose significant safety concerns to both themselves and other drivers. Expanding on previous work, we designed and tested a gaze-contingent driving intervention system in which drivers were required to not only perform well, but also to look at key regions of interest in the environment such as traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians and side-view mirrors. We present preliminary results from a study comparing performance outcomes and eye gaze patterns in a group using the gaze-contingent system and a group using a gaze-insensitive, performance-based system.

AB  - Understanding where humans look in a scene is significant for many applications. Researches on neuroscience and cognitive psychology show that human brain always pays attention on special areas when they observe an image. In this paper, we recorded and analyzed human eye-tracking data, we found that these areas mainly were focus on semantic objects. Inspired by neuroscience, deep learning concept is proposed. Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) as one of methods of deep learning can solve image objects segmentation at semantic level efficiently. So we bring forth a new visual attention model which uses FCN to stimulate the cognitive processing of human free observing a natural scene and fuses attractive low-level features to predict fixation locations. Experimental results demonstrated our model has apparently advantages in biology.

TI  - A blueprint for integrated eye-controlled environments
JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 311
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Eye-based environmental control requires innovative solutions for supporting effective user interaction, for allowing home automation and control, and for making homes more “attentive” to user needs. Several approaches have already been proposed, which can be seen as isolated attempts to address partial issues and specific sub-sets of the general problem. This paper aims at tackling gaze-based home automation as a whole, exploiting state-of-the-art technologies and trying to integrate interaction modalities that are currently supported and that may be supported in the near future. User–home interaction is sought through two, complementary, interaction patterns: direct interaction and mediated interaction. Integration between home appliances and devices and user interfaces is granted by a central point of abstraction and harmonization called House Manager. Innovative points can be identified in the wide flexibility of the approach which allows on one side to integrate virtually all home devices having a communication interface, and, on the other side, combines direct and mediated user interaction exploiting the advantages of both. A discussion of interaction and accessibility issues is also provided, justifying the presented approach from the point of view of human–environment interaction.

AB  - In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of finding a good and homogeneous representation to encode line drawing documents (which may be handwritten). We propose a method in which the problems induced by a first step skeletisation have been avoided. We first achieve a hierarchical representation that enables a fine description of the drawing using only pixels, vectors and quadrilateral primitives. This representation gives a global vision of the drawings. Then, its capacity to evolve and to carry high semantical local entities is highlighted. Finally we show how an architecture of perceptive cycles allows a better quality interpretation of the document.

TI  - A cognition-centered personalization framework for cultural-heritage content
JO  - User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction
SP  - 9
EP  - 65
VL  - 29
IS  - 1
AB  - The heterogeneity of the audience of cultural heritage institutions introduces numerous challenges to the delivery of the content. Considering that people differ in the way they perceive, process, and recall information and that their individual cognitive differences influence their experience, performance, and knowledge acquisition when performing cultural-heritage activities, the human-cognition factor should be considered as an important personalization factor within cultural-heritage contexts. To this end, we propose a cognition-centered personalization framework for delivering cultural-heritage activities, tailored to the users’ cognitive characteristics. The framework implements rule-based personalization algorithms that are based on cognition-centered user models that are created implicitly, transparently, and in run-time based on classifiers that correlate end-user cognitive characteristics with interaction and visual behavior patterns. For evaluating the proposed framework and improving the external validity of the experimental results, we conducted two eye-tracking between-subjects user-studies ($$N=226$$N=226) covering two different cognitive styles (field dependence–independence and visualizer–verbalizer) and two different types of cultural activity (visual goal-oriented and visual exploratory). The results provide evidence about the applicability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed framework and underpin the added value of adopting cognition-centered personalization frameworks within digitized cultural-heritage interaction contexts.

TI  - A comprehensive survey of AR/MR-based co-design in manufacturing
JO  - Engineering with Computers
AB  - For more than 2 decades, Augmented Reality (AR)/Mixed Reality (MR) has received an increasing amount of attention by researchers and practitioners in the manufacturing community, because it has applications in many fields, such as product design, training, maintenance, assembly, and other manufacturing operations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive review of AR-based co-design in manufacturing. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research, projects, and technical characteristics between 1990 and 2017 in the domain of co-design based on AR technology. Among these papers, more than 90% of them were published between 2000 and 2017, and these recent relevant works are discussed at length. The paper provides a comprehensive academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR-based co-design systems and developments in manufacturing for future researchers all over the world. This work will be useful to researchers who plan to utilize AR as a tool for design research.

AB  - This survey presents a comprehensive study on non-photorealistic rendering (NPR). NPR technique renders 2D input image into abstracted and artistic stylized images. NPR mainly dwells on image processing, computer vision, and visualizing the graphics processing techniques. The survey highlights the evolution of IA–AR system and the subsequent classification of NPR techniques. The survey also has cognized the various works done on stroke-based rendering, color image analogy, region-based rendering, image filtering abstraction, and stylization. The inference drawn from the survey is the computer system using a stylus to fully automatic structure-preserving image abstraction and stylization got evolved from a traditional method of human interaction. From the survey carried out on the most significant papers from 1963 to 2017, we felt the need for setting up of benchmark guidelines, the data set with varies subjective matters, and quality assessment techniques with various statistical essences. From the survey information pertaining to benchmark image characteristics, properties and their constraints with the contextual feature in an image have been identified. Finally, survey work listed out the NPR application in various fields of image processing and highlighted empirical challenges and hampers in NPR domain. This survey work has empowered us to proceed in the right direction and enthusiasm to bring forth the problem statement and carry out research work.

JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 145
EP  - 159
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - Advances related to the popularization of the Ambient Intelligence approach imply that new styles of computer–human interaction are being adopted, and, at the same time, the need of supporting activities of collaborative nature appears. In these contexts, the concept of implicit interaction appears. This concept refers to those actions that a computer considers as inputs although the user has not intended to explicitly generate an input. When dealing with implicit interaction, classic concepts about computer–human interaction are not enough, for example, when giving support to awareness. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework for helping software engineers to collect requirements and describe awareness support in systems in which collaborative activities should be supported and in which both implicit and explicit interactions may occur. As these systems may deal with both implicit and explicit interactions, their user interfaces may be of a multimodal nature. The framework includes a categorization of awareness dimensions that extends previous relevant works in the literature, a catalogue of widgets and devices for awareness support, and a technique for carrying out the specifications, which we call awareness cards. We have carried out some validations of our framework, including its application to some cases and some modeling activities with users.

JO  - Applied Intelligence
SP  - 3995
EP  - 4022
VL  - 48
IS  - 11
AB  - This paper intends to develop a multi-objective solid transportation problem considering carbon emission, where the parameters are of gamma type-2 fuzzy in nature. This paper proposed the defuzzification process for gamma type-2 fuzzy variable using critical value (CV ) and nearest interval approximation method. A chance constraint programming problem is generated using the CV based reduction method to convert the fuzzy problem to its equivalent crisp form. Applying the α$\alpha $-cut based interval approximation method, a deterministic problem is developed. Some real life data are used to minimize the cost and carbon emission. LINGO standard optimization solver has been used to solve the multi-objective problem using weighted sum method and intuitionistic fuzzy programming technique. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are implemented to generate efficient optimal solution by converting the multi-objective problem to a single objective problem using penalty cost for carbon emission. After solving the problem, analysis on some particular cases has been presented. The sensitivity analysis has been shown to different credibility levels of cost, emission, source, demand, conveyance to find total cost, emission and transported amount in each level. A comparison study on the performance of three algorithms (LINGO, GA and PSO) is presented. At the end, some graphs have been plotted which shows the effect of emission with different emission parameters.

Experimental results with our GP approach are very promising and compare favourably with those produced by support vector machines.

AB  - This paper presents a principled analysis of various combinations of image features to determine their suitability for remote eye tracking. It begins by reviewing the basic theory underlying the connection between eye image and gaze direction. Then a set of approaches is proposed based on different combinations of well-known features and their behaviour is evaluated, taking into account various additional criteria such as free head movement, and minimum hardware and calibration requirements. The paper proposes a final method based on multiple glints and the pupil centre; the method is evaluated experimentally. Future trends in eye tracking technology are also discussed.

VL  - 27
IS  - 3
AB  - Moving between devices is omnipresent, but not for people with disabilities or those who require specific accessibility options. Setting up assistive technologies or finding settings to overcome a certain barrier can be a demanding task for people without technical skills. Context-sensitive adaptive user interfaces are advancing, although migrating access features from one device to another is very rarely addressed. In this paper, we describe the knowledge-based component of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure that infers how a device shall be best configured at the operating system layer, the application layer and the web layer to meet the requirements of a user including possible special needs or disabilities. In this regard, a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicting accessibility policies as well as recommending preference substitutes is a main requirement, as elaborated in this paper. As the proposed system emulates decision-making of accessibility experts, we validated the automatic deduced configurations against manual configurations of ten accessibility experts. The assessment result shows that the average matching score of the developed system is high. Thus, the proposed system can be considered capable of making precise decisions towards personalizing user interfaces based on user needs and preferences.

TI  - A learning-based visual saliency prediction model for stereoscopic 3D video (LBVS-3D)
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 23859
EP  - 23890
VL  - 76
IS  - 22
AB  - Saliency prediction models provide a probabilistic map of relative likelihood of an image or video region to attract the attention of the human visual system. Over the past decade, many computational saliency prediction models have been proposed for 2D images and videos. Considering that the human visual system has evolved in a natural 3D environment, it is only natural to want to design visual attention models for 3D content. Existing monocular saliency models are not able to accurately predict the attentive regions when applied to 3D image/video content, as they do not incorporate depth information. This paper explores stereoscopic video saliency prediction by exploiting both low-level attributes such as brightness, color, texture, orientation, motion, and depth, as well as high-level cues such as face, person, vehicle, animal, text, and horizon. Our model starts with a rough segmentation and quantifies several intuitive observations such as the effects of visual discomfort level, depth abruptness, motion acceleration, elements of surprise, size and compactness of the salient regions, and emphasizing only a few salient objects in a scene. A new fovea-based model of spatial distance between the image regions is adopted for considering local and global feature calculations. To efficiently fuse the conspicuity maps generated by our method to one single saliency map that is highly correlated with the eye-fixation data, a random forest based algorithm is utilized. The performance of the proposed saliency model is evaluated against the results of an eye-tracking experiment, which involved 24 subjects and an in-house database of 61 captured stereoscopic videos. Our stereo video database as well as the eye-tracking data are publicly available along with this paper. Experiment results show that the proposed saliency prediction method achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

JO  - Machine Translation
SP  - 61
EP  - 90
VL  - 33
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper presents a comparison of post-editing (PE) changes performed on English-to-Finnish neural (NMT), rule-based (RBMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT) output, combining a product-based and a process-based approach. A total of 33 translation students acted as participants in a PE experiment providing both post-edited texts and edit process data. Our product-based analysis of the post-edited texts shows statistically significant differences in the distribution of edit types between machine translation systems. Deletions were the most common edit type for the RBMT, insertions for the SMT, and word form changes as well as word substitutions for the NMT system. The results also show significant differences in the correctness and necessity of the edits, particularly in the form of a large number of unnecessary edits in the RBMT output. Problems related to certain verb forms and ambiguity were observed for NMT and SMT, while RBMT was more likely to handle them correctly. Process-based comparison of effort indicators shows a slight increase of keystrokes per word for NMT output, and a slight decrease in average pause length for NMT compared to RBMT and SMT in specific text blocks. A statistically significant difference was observed in the number of visits per sub-segment, which is lower for NMT than for RBMT and SMT. The results suggest that although different types of edits were needed to outputs from NMT, RBMT and SMT systems, the difference is not necessarily reflected in process-based effort indicators.

AB  - Epidemiological studies indicate that automobile drivers from varying demographics are confronted by difficult driving contexts such as negotiating intersections, yielding, merging and overtaking. We aim to detect and track the face and eyes of the driver during several driving scenarios, allowing for further understanding of a driver’s visual search pattern behavior. Traditionally, detection and tracking of objects in visual media has been performed using specific techniques. These techniques vary in terms of their robustness and computational cost. This research proposes a real-time framework that is built upon a foundation synonymous to boosting, which we extend from learners to trackers and demonstrate that the idea of an integrated framework employing multiple trackers is advantageous in forming a globally strong tracking methodology. In order to model the effectiveness of trackers, a confidence parameter is introduced to help minimize the errors produced by incorrect matches and allow more effective trackers with a higher confidence value to correct the perceived position of the target.

AB  - With over thirty million individuals with disabilities being reported in the United States, and with information systems permeating nearly every aspect of society, there is a growing urgency to ensure that everyone has equal access to technology. To render information technologies universally accessible, researchers must have at their disposal an accurate and reliable user model. Through the use of the conceptual framework presented here, accurate assumptions can be generated from knowledge of an individual’s impairments, and functional abilities to influence the creation of a user profile. Ultimately, user profiles serve as a vital attribute of user models applied to the design of technology in an effort to achieve universal access.

AB  - Substantial literature exists regarding how eye-tracking systems can be used to measure cognitive load and how these measurements can be useful for adapting training in real time. Much of the published literature discusses the applications and limitations of the research and typically provides recommendations for improvement. This review assesses these articles collectively to provide a clearer solution for implementing eye-tracking systems into a training environment. Although limitations exist for using eye tracking as an interface tool, gaze and pupillary response have been successfully used to reflect changes in cognitive load and are starting to be incorporated into adaptive training systems, although issues are still present with differentiating pupil responses from simultaneous psychological effects. Additionally, current eye-tracking systems and data analysis software have proven accurate enough for general use, but issues including system cost and software integration prevent this technology from becoming commercialized for use in common instructional settings.

VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper aims to propose and evaluate a markerless solution for capturing hand movements in real time to allow 3D interactions in virtual environments (VEs). Tools such as keyboard and mice are not enough for interacting in 3D VE; current motion capture systems are expensive and require wearing equipment. We developed a solution to allow more natural interactions with objects and VE for navigation and manipulation tasks. We conducted an experimental study involving 20 participants. The goal was to realize object manipulation (moving, orientation, scaling) and navigation tasks in VE. We compared our solution (Microsoft Kinect-based) with data gloves and magnetic sensors (3DGloves) regarding two criteria: performance and acceptability. Results demonstrate similar performance (precision, execution time) but a better overall acceptability for our solution. Preferences of participants are mostly in favor of the 3DCam, mainly for the criteria of comfort, freedom of movement, and handiness. Our solution can be considered as a real alternative to conventional systems for object manipulation in virtual reality.

TI  - A solid transportation problem in uncertain environment involving type-2 fuzzy variable
JO  - Neural Computing and Applications
SP  - 4903
EP  - 4927
VL  - 31
IS  - 9
AB  - The main focus of this paper is to develop a new safety-based restricted fixed charge solid transportation problem with type-2 fuzzy parameter that minimizes both cost and time. Here we develop mainly two models, the first one has cost and time as type-2 fuzzy variables and the second one has cost, time and all the other parameters of the solid transportation problem as type-2 fuzzy variables. We also consider restrictions on the amount of transport goods. Both of these models are solved by two different techniques. First is using the usual credibility measure, and second is the generalized credibility measure. For the first technique, we use critical value (CV)-based reduction method to reduce a type-2 fuzzy set into a type-1 fuzzy set and then apply the centroid method to this reduced fuzzy set to find the corresponding crisp value. In the second case, a chance constrained programming model based on generalized credibility has been developed with the help of CV-based reduction method. The equivalent parametric programming problem in deterministic form is then solved under the weighted mean programming technique framework, the global criteria method and with the help of LINGO 13.0 software. Lastly, we have provided two real-life-based numerical examples to illustrate the models and also validate the results with the existing work. Some sensitivity analyses for the models are also presented with some logical comments. Finally the effects of total cost and time due to the changes of credibility levels of cost, time, demand, source, conveyance and safety are discussed.

JO  - International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition
SP  - 58
EP  - 66
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of finding a good and homogeneous representation to encode line-drawing documents (which may be handwritten). We propose a method in which the problems induced by a first-step skeletonization have been avoided. First, we vectorize the image, to get a fine description of the drawing, using only vectors and quadrilateral primitives. A structural graph is built with the primitives extracted from the initial line-drawing image. The objective is to manage attributes relative to elementary objects so as to provide a description of the spatial relationships (inclusion, junction, intersection, etc.) that exist between the graphics in the images. This is done with a representation that provides a global vision of the drawings. The capacity of the representation to evolve and to carry highly semantic information is also highlighted. Finally, we show how an architecture using this structural representation and a mechanism of perceptive cycles can lead to a high-quality interpretation of line drawings.

TI  - A study of build inflation in 30 million CPAN builds on 13 Perl versions and 10 operating systems
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
AB  - Continuous Integration (CI) is a cornerstone of modern quality assurance, providing on-demand builds (compilation and tests) of code changes or software releases. Yet the many existing CI systems do not help developers in interpreting build results, in particular when facing build inflation. Build inflation arises when each code change has to be built on dozens of combinations (configurations) of runtime environments (REs), operating systems (OSes), and hardware architectures (HAs). A code change C1 sent to the CI system may introduce programming faults that result in all these builds to fail, while a change C2 introducing a new library dependency might only lead one particular build configuration to fail. Consequently, the one build failure due to C2 will be “hidden” among the dozens of build failures due to C1 when the CI system reports the results of the builds. We have named this phenomenon build inflation, because it may bias the interpretation of build results by developers by “hiding” certain types of faults.

AB  - Information visualization (InfoVis), the study of transforming data, information, and knowledge into interactive visual representations, is very important to users because it provides mental models of information. The boom in big data analytics has triggered broad use of InfoVis in a variety of domains, ranging from finance to sports to politics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and key insights into this fast-rising area. The research on InfoVis is organized into a taxonomy that contains four main categories, namely empirical methodologies, user interactions, visualization frameworks, and applications, which are each described in terms of their major goals, fundamental principles, recent trends, and state-of-the-art approaches. At the conclusion of this survey, we identify existing technical challenges and propose directions for future research.

AB  - A new body of research, concerning the divergence of information systems away from today's ubiquitous notion of ‘computer’, is emerging. Though the various threads of inquiry diverge significantly in their approach, each generally seeks some intimate integration of computational resources with its user's immediate or extended environment. We introduce here a new project called theLuminous Room, which uses dynamically controlled video projection to permit information access and manipulation throughout an architectural space. A description of the working components of the system is followed by an explication of the philosophies that provide both motivation and a conceptual scaffolding for the work. Finally, we offer speculations about the way in which formal architecture and ‘environmental’ information systems like theLuminous Room might co-develop.

AB  - A wearable device for capturing 3D gaze information in indoor and outdoor environments is proposed. The hardware and software architecture of the device provides an estimate in quasi-real-time of 2.5D points of regard (POR) and then lift their estimations to 3D, by projecting them into the 3D reconstructed scene. The estimation procedure does not need any external device, and can be used both indoor and outdoor and with the subject wearing it moving, though some smooth constraint in the motion are required. To ensure a great flexibility with respect to depth a novel calibration method is proposed, which provides eye-scene calibration that explicitly takes into account depth information, in so ensuring a quite accurate estimation of the PORs. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that both 2.5D and 3D POR are accurately estimated.

VL  - 10

AB  - We present a computational cognitive model of novice and expert aviation pilot action planning called ADAPT that models performance in a dynamically changing simulated flight environment. We perform rigorous tests of ADAPT's predictive validity by comparing the performance of individual human pilots to that of their respective models. Individual pilots were asked to execute a series of flight maneuvers using a flight simulator, and their eye fixations and control movements were recorded in a time-synched database. Computational models of each of the 25 individual pilots were constructed, and the individual models simulated execution of the same flight maneuvers performed by the human pilots. The time-synched eye fixations and control movements of individual pilots and their respective models were compared, and rigorous tests of ADAPT's predictive validity were performed. The model explains and predicts a significant portion of pilot visual attention and control movements during flight as a function of piloting expertise. Implications for adaptive training systems are discussed.

EP  - 707
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - When intelligent agents learn visuomotor behaviors from human demonstrations, they may benefit from knowing where the human is allocating visual attention, which can be inferred from their gaze. A wealth of information regarding intelligent decision making is conveyed by human gaze allocation; hence, exploiting such information has the potential to improve the agents’ performance. With this motivation, we propose the AGIL (Attention Guided Imitation Learning) framework. We collect high-quality human action and gaze data while playing Atari games in a carefully controlled experimental setting. Using these data, we first train a deep neural network that can predict human gaze positions and visual attention with high accuracy (the gaze network) and then train another network to predict human actions (the policy network). Incorporating the learned attention model from the gaze network into the policy network significantly improves the action prediction accuracy and task performance.

AB  - The wide variety of technological devices is a barrier to satisfactory usage and learning over all. Different types of interface element distribution and dissimilarities of their functionalities, even in the same category of products under the same brand, can steepen the learning curve to effective device operation. Interface design can be understood as a mechanism for the adequacy of the technological environment to substantially improve performance, satisfaction and life of the user with special requirements. Based on an inclusive paradigm, we aim to improve the usability, accessibility and satisfiability of the interface for a specific group of users, such as novice elderly, to benefit all types of users in their daily lives. The requirements derived from a holistic analysis of user, goals and context lead to the introduction of the AGILE Interface (Assisted Guided Interaction with no Learning nor Experience required). This interface is the pillar of a new interaction style designed to assist and guide users with specific needs owing to age and non-Information and Technology experience. In the context of present-day technology interactions, the ultimate goal of this work is to move beyond out of date user stereotypes to tailor appropriate interface design adapted to realistic and specific user demands.

AB  - Eye typing, which utilizes eye gaze input to interact with computers, provides an indispensable means for people with severe disabilities to write, to talk, and to communicate. Despite more than two decades’ of research into eye typing (which, for the most part, focused on the hardware/technical aspects associated with implementing a system), there lacks a well designed solution that has incorporated the key research findings and integrated them into a unified system. Hence, we designed and developed a novel user interface AVIN (Assisted Visual Interactive Notepad) for eye writing that expedites the writing workflow to enhance the overall user experience. Our preliminary user testing results showed that a novice user can achieve 7 wpm with an hour’s typing practice, and a more experienced user can achieve 15 wpm with ten hours’ practice; whereas an expert user can only reach 6-8 wpm using the standard QWERTY design.

AB  - Platform owners develop boundary resources to transfer design capabilities to third-party developers and boost innovation within platform ecosystems. The literature on boundary resources suggests the concept of tuning to depict the process where such resources are shaped through an interactive process involving platform owners, third-party developers and other actors within the platform ecology. While the literature on the tuning of boundary resources is promising and emerging, there is to our knowledge no current studies on platform owners’ measures to speed up this often prolonged process. In this research, we studied how a platform owner sought to accelerate the tuning process of its boundary resource through a case study at Volvo Group Truck Technology. In doing so, Volvo used an innovation contest where third-party developers used several boundary resources and engaged in an accelerated tuning process with Volvo Group Technology.

TI  - Accessing Tele-Services Using a Hybrid BCI Approach
BT  - Advances in Computational Intelligence
SP  - 110

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology has achieved limited success outside of laboratory conditions. This technology is hindered by practical considerations of set up, lack of robustness and low Information Transfer Rate (ITR). There are two interfaces in a BCI system: the brain’s interface with the computer and the computer-environment interface, which provides access to applications for the user. Three user services were implemented: control of the smart home, entertainment and communication. These may be accessed through a graphical user interface controlled by a BCI. The paper contrasts the performance of an SSVEP based system with a hybrid BCI comprising eye gaze and muscle response (measured at the scalp). The hybrid developed utilizes the EPOC for recording electrical potential and an EyeTribe gaze tracker; these can be combined to provide more robust interaction with applications. Average ITR for the eye tracker and hybrid approaches (190-200 bpm) are higher than for our SSVEP approach (approx. 15 bpm), for the same applications. The poor performance of our SSVEP system was due to the temporal duration of the stimulation (7s) and partly because not all participants could achieve an accuracy of greater than 50%. The current challenge is the replacement of the scalp recorded muscle component with a reliable user modifiable EEG measure.

AB  - Depth of field (DOF) rendering is important in computer graphics, especially in image synthesis and virtual reality applications. Traditionally, a filter with size varying kernels is applied to facilitate DOF rendering, however, the kernel size is approximated by rounding, ignoring the fractional parts, thus causing inconsistencies around the edges. In this paper, we proposed to adapt exact kernel size for depth of field rendering, not only the integral part, but also the fractional part of the kernel size are considered. In addition, we proposed a method to speed up the calculation based on integral images. Experiment results indicate that our proposed method is a practical way for depth of field rendering.

SP  - 221

VL  - 75
IS  - 1
AB  - Most of the existing gaze tracking schemes with high accuracy and high speed depend on infra-red (IR) lights and multi-cameras, which leads to high complexity of apparatus and high cost. Besides, many proposed approaches hardly offer a full discussion and solution of eye blink issue. In this paper, we propose a novel gaze tracking scheme which is capable of tracking eye movements in high accuracy. Our scheme incorporates the eye corner information extracted using a novel eye corner detector. This detector is developed based on the Gabor Wavelet Transform and the Structure Tensor. Gabor Wavelet Transform decomposes an image in multi-scales and multi-orientations, thus is robust against lighting variation and tiny shift. We abstract the distribution statistics of the feature points in the eye region and re-express it as a connectivity graph. Based on such abstraction we propose a novel solution to the eye blink issue which obtains a high successful detection rate. After implementation, our scheme is proven to be accurate compared with the state of the art. Notably, only one web camera is employed in our scheme without any auxiliary light source or cameras.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper introduces AcouMotion as a new hard-/software system for combining human body motion, tangible interfaces and sonification to a closed-loop human computer interface that allows non-visual motor control by using sonification (non-speech auditory displays) as major feedback channel. AcouMotion’s main components are (i) a sensor device for measuring motion parameters (ii) a computer simulation to represent the dynamical evolution of a model world, and (iii) a sonification engine which generates an auditory representation of objects and any interactions in the model world. The intended applications of AcouMotion range from new kinds of sport games that can be played without visual displays and therefore may be particularly interesting for people with visual impairment to further applications in data mining, physiotherapy and cognitive research. The first application of AcouMotion presented in this paper is Blindminton, a sport game similar to Badminton which is particularly adapted to the abilities of people with visual impairment. We describe our current system and its state of development, and we present first sound examples for interactive sonification using an early prototype. Finally, we discuss some interesting research directions based on the fact that AcouMotion binds auditory stimuli and body motion, and thus can represent a counterpart to the Eye-tracker device that exploits the binding of visual stimuli and eye-movement in cognitive research.

Two control modes have been implemented—an orthogonal mode (where the pointer moves with variable speed either horizontally or vertically at any one time) and a melodic mode (where the pointer moves with fixed speed in any direction). A preliminary user study with four users indicates that the orthogonal control was easier to operate and that the humming was less tiring for the users than whistling. The developed system may contribute as an inexpensive, alternative pointing device for people with motor disabilities.

AB  - Cognitive neuroscience experiments show how people intensify the exchange of non-verbal cues when they work on a joint task towards a common goal. When individuals share their intentions, it creates a social interaction that drives the mutual alignment of their actions and behavior. To understand the intentions of others, we strongly rely on the gaze cues. According to the role each person plays in the interaction, the resulting alignment of the body and gaze movements will be different. This mechanism is key to understand and model dyadic social interactions.

TI  - Adapting Human-Computer-Interaction of Attentive Smart Glasses to the Trade-Off Conflict in Purchase Decisions: An Experiment in a Virtual Supermarket
BT  - Augmented Cognition. Neurocognition and Machine Learning
SP  - 219
EP  - 235
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In many everyday purchase decisions, consumers have to trade-off their decisions between alternatives. For example, consumers often have to decide whether to buy the more expensive high quality product or the less expensive product of lower quality. Marketing researchers are especially interested in finding out how consumers make decisions when facing such trade-off conflicts and eye-tracking has been used as a tool to investigate the allocation of attention in such situations. Conflicting decision situations are also particularly interesting for human-computer interaction research because designers may use knowledge about the information acquisition behavior to build assistance systems which can help the user to solve the trade-off conflict. In this paper, we build and test such an assistance system that monitors the user’s information acquisition processes using mobile eye-tracking in the virtual reality. In particular, we test whether and how strongly the trade-off conflict influences how consumers direct their attention to products and features. We find that trade-off conflict, task experience and task involvement significantly influence how much attention products receive. We discuss how this knowledge might be used in the future to build assistance systems in the form of attentive smart glasses.

AB  - Research in virtual camera control has focused primarily on finding methods to allow designers to place cameras effectively and efficiently in dynamic and unpredictable environments, and to generate complex and dynamic plans for cinematography in virtual environments. In this article, we propose a novel approach to virtual camera control, which builds upon camera control and player modelling to provide the user with an adaptive point-of-view. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to model the player’s preferences on virtual camera movements and we employ the resulting models to tailor the viewpoint movements to the player type and her game-play style. Ultimately, the methodology is applied to a 3D platform game and is evaluated through a controlled experiment; the results suggest that the resulting adaptive cinematographic experience is favoured by some player types and it can generate a positive impact on the game performance.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to present a new adaptive automation concept which offers an innovative ‘team’ centred approach to solving human factors/workload management problems. The A-PiMod concept/approach is defined by the concept of partnership – specifically, the “Third Pilot” and the crew and automation are in charge together. We are proposing partnership as opposed to dynamic changes in control function where changes can be controlled autonomously by the system. In support of this, a new multimodal concept is proposed which supports improved assessment of crew state/workload (i.e. information inputs re crew activity/interactions provides a means to communicate with the crew in relation to crew state and decision support, and allows for flexible crew/cockpit interaction).

EP  - 43
VL  - 52
IS  - 1
AB  - In this paper, an eye tracking method and an automatic focusing technique, which combine the regulation of the aperture with the adjustment of the focus of the camera lens, are proposed to acquire clear eye images in the eye-gaze tracking system. Firstly, the aperture of the CCD lens is controlled to adapt the system to external lighting circumstances with the average brightness value of the processed images as the basic value. Secondly, a sum-modulus-difference (SMD) operator is used for rough and quick focusing in a large scale to obtain the eye glints, and for the control of a pan-tilt unit to track and aim at the eye, and for regulation of the lens focus. Finally, a frequency selective weighted median (FSWM) operator is applied in the determined window to focus automatically and acquire clear eye images. If the pupil contour can be extracted from the eye image, then the average gradient value of the pupil’s edge points can be used for real-time focusing. Experimental results show that this system can adapt to external lighting changes and to the user’s head movements. It can track the eye and acquire clear eye images in real-time.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 5
EP  - 22
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - The graphical user interfaces of popular software are often inaccessible to people with severe motion impairments, who cannot use the traditional keyboard and mouse, and require an alternative input device. Reaching for buttons and selecting menu items, in particular, can be difficult for nonverbal individuals with quadriplegia, who control the mousepointer with head motion via a mouse-replacement system. This paper proposes interaction techniques that can be used with mouse-replacement systems and enable the creation of accessible graphical user interfaces. To illustrate these techniques, the paper presents an image editing application, named Camera Canvas, that uses a sliding toolbar as its universal menu controller. The parameters of the toolbar automatically adapt to the movement abilities of the specific user. Individuals with and without disabilities and of a variety of ages were observed using Camera Canvas. It was found that the developed techniques worked across many different movement abilities and experience levels. Then, it was investigated how such techniques could be used to “retrofit” existing Windows applications with new graphical user interfaces. A tool called Menu Controller was created that can automatically re-render the menus of some existing applications into adaptive sliding toolbars. Menu Controller enables users of mouse-replacement systems to select menu entries that were otherwise inaccessible to them.

JO  - User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction
SP  - 267
EP  - 311
VL  - 27
IS  - 2
AB  - Personalised content adaptation has great potential to increase user engagement in video games. Procedural generation of user-tailored content increases the self-motivation of players as they immerse themselves in the virtual world. An adaptive user model is needed to capture the skills of the player and enable automatic game content altering algorithms to fit the individual user. We propose an adaptive user modelling approach using a combination of unobtrusive physiological data to identify strengths and weaknesses in user performance in car racing games. Our system creates user-tailored tracks to improve driving habits and user experience, and to keep engagement at high levels. The user modelling approach adopts concepts from the Trace Theory framework; it uses machine learning to extract features from the user’s physiological data and game-related actions, and cluster them into low level primitives. These primitives are transformed and evaluated into higher level abstractions such as experience, exploration and attention. These abstractions are subsequently used to provide track alteration decisions for the player. Collection of data and feedback from 52 users allowed us to associate key model variables and outcomes to user responses, and to verify that the model provides statistically significant decisions personalised to the individual player. Tailored game content variations between users in our experiments, as well as the correlations with user satisfaction demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically incorporate user feedback in subsequent procedural content generation.

SP  - 110
EP  - 121
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper investigates the value of eye tracking in evaluating the usability of a Learning Management System, at an open distance learning university where the users’ computer and Web skills vary significantly. Eye tracking utilize the users’ eye movements, while doing a task, to provide information about the nature, sequence and timing of the cognitive operations that took place. This information supplements, but does not replace standard usability testing with observations. This forces the questions of when the added value of eye tracking justifies the added cost and resources. Existing research has indicated significant differences in the usability experienced by experts and non-experts on the same system. The aim of this paper is to go one step further and shed light on the type and severity of the usability problems experienced by non-expert users. Usability testing with eye tracking is a resource intensive method but our findings indicate that eye tracking adds concise, summarised evidence of usability problems that justifies the cost when testing special groups such as users deficient in Web and computer skills. The contribution of this paper is to highlight the added value of eye tracking as a usability evaluation method in working with Web non-expert users. Furthermore, the findings improve our understanding of the knowledge differences between expert and non-expert Web users and the practical challenges involved in working with non-expert users.

AB  - User interfaces are recognized as the major part of work for real programs, approximately 50 %. They have a very important impact on the way products are used, make the reputation of the organization that produces them, and may cause safety issues. Usability engineering (Nielsen, Usability engineering, 1993) has become a mandatory discipline in the production of systems. According to the International Standard Organization (ISO), usability is “the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments” (ISO 9241-11). This being said, we need to be careful about the interpretation of this definition. Indeed, “users” can be novice, occasional or expert in a given domain.

AB  - This paper describes an advanced human-computer interface that combines real-time, reactive and high fidelity virtual humans with artificial vision and communicative intelligence to create a closed-loop interaction model and achieve an affective interface. The system, called the Virtual Human Interface (VHI), utilizes a photo-real facial and body model as a virtual agent to convey information beyond speech and actions. Specifically, the VHI uses a dictionary of nonverbal signals including body language, hand gestures and subtle emotional display to support verbal content in a reactive manner. Furthermore, its built in facial tracking and artificial vision system allows the virtual human to maintain eye contact, follow the motion of the user and even recognizing when somebody joins him or her in front of the terminal and act accordingly. Additional sensors allow the virtual agent to react to touch, voice and other modalities of interaction. The system has been tested in a real-world scenario whereas a virtual child reacted to visitors in an exhibition space.

Focusing on capture and re-enactment of human expertise, this work looks at the unique affordances of suitable hard- and software technologies. The practical challenges of interpreting expertise, using suitable sensors for its capture and specifying the means to describe and display to the novice are of central significance here. We link affordances with hardware devices, discussing their alternatives, including Microsoft Hololens, Thalmic Labs MYO, Alex Posture sensor, MyndPlay EEG headband, and a heart rate sensor. Following the selection of sensors, we describe integration and communication requirements for the prototype. We close with thoughts on the wider possibilities for implementation and next steps.

AB  - Age-related differences were investigated in a usability study of an application developed for U.S. Census Bureau enumerators to collect survey data and automate their time and expenses. Accuracy, efficiency and satisfaction measures were collected as participants used a smartphone to answer typical tasks. Usability flaws were also identified with the application. Results indicate that in general there were no differences with task accuracy and efficiency when comparing all tasks, however when looking at individual tasks, the task that had the most usability flaws also revealed age-related differences for accuracy and efficiency – that is older adults were less accurate and took longer to complete. Surprisingly, there were age-related differences with the user satisfaction of the application such that older adults were less satisfied with the application than younger adults. Tying age-related differences to usability flaws highlights the importance of designing optimal applications for all users.

AB  - In a simulated task of airport security inspection for threat items of knives, guns and IEDs, the difference between screeners and naïve people was analysed in terms of detection performance, attention allocation and workload. The detection performance of screeners was significantly better than that of naïve people. Compared to naïve observers, screeners concentrated on one or two potential threat items and ignored some irrelevant contents in the X-ray images which are showed by fixation maps. In order to understand how observers missed targets the workload between hit and miss decisions was compared. Unfortunately, there was no difference on workload when they hit or missed the targets where the dwell time on the targets of the hit decisions was longer than that of miss decisions. The findings may highlight how the search expertise is developed and provide information for improving training program.

AB  - Present aircraft are highly automated systems. In general, automation improved aviation safety significantly. However, automation exhibits itself in many forms of adverse behaviors related to human factors problems. A major finding is that insufficient support of partnership between the pilot crew and the aircraft automation can result in conflicting intentions. The European project A-PiMod (Applying Pilot Models for Safer Aircraft) addresses issues of conventional automation in the aviation domain. The overall objective of the project is to foster pilot crew-automation partnership on the basis of a novel architecture for cooperative automation. An essential part of the architecture is an intention recognition module. The intention recognition module employs a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to infer the most probable current intention of the human pilots. The HMM is trained and evaluated with data containing interactions of human pilots with the aircraft cockpit systems. The data was obtained during experiments with human pilots in a flight simulator.

AB  - A novel method for distinguishing classes of viewers from their aggregated eye movements is described. The probabilistic framework accumulates uniformly sampled gaze as Gaussian point spread functions (heatmaps), and measures the distance of unclassified scanpaths to a previously classified set (or sets). A similarity measure is then computed over the scanpath durations. The approach is used to compare human observers’s gaze over video to regions of interest (ROIs) automatically predicted by a computational saliency model. Results show consistent discrimination between human and artificial ROIs, regardless of either of two differing instructions given to human observers (free or tasked viewing).

AB  - In this study, we established an advanced learning environment that aims to promote learning of social communication skills for children especially those with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The learning environment estimates in real time the affective & cognitive state of a child via recognition of multi-modal social signals, and generates interactive narratives with embodied virtual characters. One of the key components of the environment is the Visual Inputs Processor, which is the first that has the capabilities of detecting a child’s attention and expression simultaneously in a natural environment. Furthermore, those have been enabled in a nonintrusive manner which avoids potential bias to the user’s behaviours introduced by intrusive counterparts. The environment also employs multiple inexpensive cameras and a large multi-touch screen, and these settings (1) maximize of space and angles in which observation may be performed and (2) provide users with a much more realistic experience than counterpart approaches do.

SP  - 281

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In this paper, we created a conceptual model UML (unified modelling language) showing interactions between animals, mosquitoes, environment, and climate factors. The UML static model was used to build an agent-based model that helps to study the impact of rainfall variability on the number of infected hosts after the outbreak of Rift valley fever. Several simulations were done on the multi-agent CORMAS platform. The different results showed continued growth in infections during the rainy season. A sensitivity analysis taking into account the delayed rains and dry spells have allowed us to know a clear vision about the rate of infected animals due to the rainfall variability. This work defines a framework for studying the impact of climatic changes on vector-borne diseases.

AB  - A reusable agent-based generic model is presented for a specific class of Ambient Intelligence applications: those cases addressing human wellbeing and functioning from a human-like understanding. The model incorporates ontologies, knowledge and dynamic models from human-directed sciences such as psychology, social science, neuroscience and biomedical sciences. The model has been formally specified, and it is shown how for specific applications it can be instantiated by application-specific elements, thus providing an executable specification that can be used for prototyping. Moreover, it is shown how dynamic properties can be formally specified and verified against generated traces.

We use eye-tracking data to capture user attention patterns on the game adaptive-hints, and present results on how these patterns are impacted by factors related to existing user knowledge, hint timing, and attitude toward getting help in general. We plan to leverage these results in the future for making hint delivery adaptive to these factors.

AB  - Human factors has been playing more and more predominant role in aviation. Pilot workload evaluation is one of the most important fields in human factors to make thorough research. Among the various workload measure techniques, it is generally recognized that workload evaluation measurement is hard to elaborate. In this paper, the definition of workload is based on time pressure and effort. The relationship between time pressure and effort is the main focus to help the selection of workload evaluation approach. The models of workload evaluation are respectively set up in time pressure and effort. Heart rate, respiration rate, respiration depth, eye tracker data and control data were obtained in the flight experiment called double hydraulic failure. By comparison with the result of workload evaluation in time pressure and effort, it can indicate that the workload evaluation should take time pressure and effort altogether into account under double hydraulic failure condition. Eventually, the analysis on the relationship between time pressure and effort enables to proceed the research of workload evaluation.

AB  - There is agreement in the literature that affect influences learning. In turn, addressing affective issues in the recommendation process has shown their ability to increase the performance of recommender systems in non-educational scenarios. In our work, we combine both research lines and describe the SAERS approach to model affective educational recommendations. This affective recommendation model has been initially validated with the application of the TORMES methodology to specific educational settings. We report 29 recommendations elicited in 12 scenarios by applying this methodology. Moreover, a UML formalized version of the recommendations model which can describe the recommendations elicited is presented in the paper.

AB  - Weiser’s vision that ubiquitous or pervasive computing will overcome the problem of information overload [1] is on the verge of becoming a reality. The volume of digital images has been increasing dramatically in recent years and as a result a crisis is now taking place within a broad range of disciplines that require and use visual content. While storage and image capture technologies are able to cope with huge numbers of images, poor image and video retrieval is in danger of rendering many repositories valueless because of the difficulty of access. Many disciplines and segments in industry, including telecommunications, entertainment, medicine, and surveillance, need high-performance retrieval systems to function efficiently — and this requirement will grow as we continue moving forward in a world connected by both fixed and wireless networks.

AB  - In this work, we investigate gaze selection in the context of mid-air hand gestural manipulation of 3D rigid bodies on monoscopic displays. We present the results of a user study with 12 participants in which we compared the performance of Gaze, a Raycasting technique (2D Cursor) and a Virtual Hand technique (3D Cursor) to select objects in two 3D mid-air interaction tasks. Also, we compared selection confirmation times for Gaze selection when selection is followed by manipulation to when it is not. Our results show that gaze selection is faster and more preferred than 2D and 3D mid-air-controlled cursors, and is particularly well suited for tasks in which users constantly switch between several objects during the manipulation. Further, selection confirmation times are longer when selection is followed by manipulation than when it is not.

TI  - An Experiment Study on the Cognitive Schema of Trajectory in Dynamic Visualization
BT  - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics
SP  - 533

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In theory, when the novel has a high-matching degree with the cognitive structure, the cognitive process maintains an equilibrium status, the assimilation process of cognitive schema generates at this time. And the new information may expand the existing cognitive structure in amount and strengthen the schema. However, if the novel has a low-matching degree with the existing cognitive structure, the cognitive process appears unbalance accompanied by the accommodation process. In big data era, the visual features of the movement of objects (trajectory) has become an important element in dynamic visualization. In the display space, the movement pattern corresponds to the movement schema in cognitive schema. Based on this, we designed an experiment to verify the theoretical reasoning of cognitive schemas of trajectory in dynamic visualization. The results showed that the cognitive schemas of trajectory in dynamic visualization could build up by iterative learning in a short time. And the cognitive schema had a certain degree of inclusiveness. The difference degree between the novel and the inherent information was the main factor of the effect of the cognitive schemas. But we didn’t found the obvious distinction between the assimilation process and the accommodation process of cognitive schemas in the experiment. We also found the different dynamic trajectories associated with the effect of cognitive schemas to a certain degree. This research opened up a new perspective of cognitive schemas for the study of dynamic visualization.

SP  - 356
EP  - 366
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Human gaze and blinking behaviours have been recently considered, to empower humanlike robots to convey a realistic behaviour in a social human-robot interaction. This paper reports the findings of our investigation on human eye-blinking behaviour in relation to human gaze behaviour, in a human-human interaction. These findings then can be used to design a humanlike eye-blinking model for a social humanlike robot. In an experimental eye-tracking study, we showed to 11 participants, a 7-minute video of social interactions of two people, and collected their eye-blinking and gaze behaviours with an eye-tracker. Analysing the collected data, we measured information such as participants’ blinking rate, maximum and minimum blinking duration, number of frequent (multiple) blinking, as well as the participants’ gaze directions on environment. The results revealed that participants’ blinking rate in a social interaction are qualitatively correlated to the gaze behaviour, as higher number of gaze shift increased the blinking rate. Based on the findings of this study, we can propose a context-dependent blinking model as an important component of the robot’s gaze control system that can empower our robot to mimic human blinking behaviour in a multiparty social interaction.

AB  - To learn the preferential visual attention given by humans to specific image content, we present NUSEF- an eye fixation database compiled from a pool of 758 images and 75 subjects. Eye fixations are an excellent modality to learn semantics-driven human understanding of images, which is vastly different from feature-driven approaches employed by saliency computation algorithms. The database comprises fixation patterns acquired using an eye-tracker, as subjects free-viewed images corresponding to many semantic categories such as faces (human and mammal), nudes and actions (look, read and shoot). The consistent presence of fixation clusters around specific image regions confirms that visual attention is not subjective, but is directed towards salient objects and object-interactions.

AB  - An experiment is reported that investigated the application of eye movement analysis in the evaluation of Web page usability. Participants completed two tasks on each of four Web site homepages. Eye movements and performance data (Response Scores and Task Completion Times) were recorded. Analyses of performance data provided reliable evidence for a variety of Page and Task effects, including a Page by Task interaction. Four eye movement measures (Average Fixation Duration, Number of Fixations, Spatial Density of Fixations, and Total Fixation Duration) were also analysed statistically, and were found to be sensitive to similar patterns of difference between Pages and Tasks that were evident in the performance data, including the Page by Task interaction. However, this interaction failed to emerge as a significant effect (although the main effects of Page and Task did). We discuss possible reasons for the nonsignificance of the interaction, and propose that for eye movement analysis to be maximally useful in interface-evaluation studies, the method needs to be refined to accommodate the temporal and dynamic aspects of interface use, such as the stage of task processing that is being engaged in.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine spatial contiguity effect on multimedia learning with an instructional animation using eye-tracking. The research method was experimental method and the study was conducted with a user group consisting of 12 participants (6 female and 6 male). The data collection tools were a demographic survey, a prior knowledge test, a retention test and an eye-tracker. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistics including Mann-Whitney U Test. According to the results there were no statistically significant difference in terms of learning outcomes, total fixation time on relevant texts and images, fixation count on relevant texts and images, and mean fixation duration on relevant images between spatial and non-spatial group according to the research results. However, mean fixation duration on relevant texts was significantly higher for spatial group than non-spatial group. According to mean ranks on all measures of eye tracking data, there may be tendency that participants in spatial group spent more time and attention on relevant text as non-spatial group spent more time and attention on narration and relevant images.

AB  - This study is concerned with using rational and emotional stimuli and analyzing changes of our visual attention responses with the aid of eye-tracking method. Those rational and emotional stimuli were designed in a form of advertising copies and images. To add rigor to our study, we organized heterogeneous stimuli and homogeneous stimuli to make appropriate stimuli, where heterogeneous stimuli consist of either emotional copies and rational images, or rational copies and emotional images. Homogeneous stimuli are designed to consist of either emotional copies and emotional images, or rational copies and rational images. By using those stimuli, we measured respondent’s cognitive load and need-for-cognition by taking advantage of the eye-tracking technique. 80 respondents were invited to our experiments, and their physiological responses were measured in a form of cognitive load and need-for-cognition. We analyzed fixation length data from the participants’ eye-movement with the stimuli. Participant’s cognitive load increased more when they were exposed to heterogeneous stimuli, while participant’s fixation length changed significantly only when there exists interaction effect between cognitive load and need-for-cognition in response to the stimuli.

EP  - 278
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - Spatial representations, such as maps, charts, and graphs, convey different levels of information, depending on how their elements are grouped into different units of objects. Therefore, how people set boundaries to graphical objects to be interpreted and how they maintain the object boundaries during the given task are two important problems in understanding the way people utilize spatial representations for problem-solving. Table comprehension process was experimentally investigated in terms of eye gaze control behaviors when people were required to read off information distributed over large-scale objects, e.g., a row or a column, of the given table. Evidence was found that a large-scale object can be bounded by a single attentional shift to it, and that they can be retained as coherent objects for subsequent reference. These findings suggest the existence of a higher-order information processing in the comprehension of a spatial representation, based on rather intricate processes of attention management.

AB  - Studies of Web search have mostly examined user behavior in text search. Recent studies begin to explore user’s Web image search behavior through survey, questionnaire, interview, etc. This study investigates user behavior on a Web image search engine using eye-tracking. The goal is to get insight into how users view search results and whether search task type and results presentation order influence their behavior. We found that search results at certain locations, e.g., the top-center area in a grid layout, were more attractive than others. The search task type significantly influenced user behavior while the results presentation order didn’t. In addition, we looked at the question of why a particular search result was selected, which showed variety of reasons. User behavior researchers and search engine developers can take advantage of these findings in order to create better search experiences to the users.

Standard cross-validation as implemented in many AI tools gives artificially high results as the common human subject is not considered. This is handled by some papers in the literature, by using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. We argue that this is not sufficient, and introduce our independent approach, which is leave-one-subject-and-one-stimulus-out cross-validation. We demonstrate our approach using KNN, SVM and NN classifiers and their ensemble, using an extended example of physiological recordings from subjects observing genuine versus posed smiles, which are the two kinds of the nicest smiles and hard for people to differentiate reliably. We use three physiological signals, 20 video stimuli and 24 observers/participants, achieving 96.1% correct results, in a truly robust fashion.

SP  - 181
EP  - 214

CY  - London
AB  - In this chapter, we present a framework to learn and predict regions of interest in videos, based on human eye movements. In our approach, the eye gaze information of several users are recorded as they watch videos that are similar, and belong to a particular application domain. This information is used to train a classifier to learn low-level video features from regions that attracted the visual attention of users. Such a classifier is combined with vision-based approaches to provide an integrated framework to detect salient regions in videos. Till date, saliency prediction has been viewed from two different perspectives, namely visual attention modeling and spatiotemporal interest point detection. These approaches have largely been vision-based. They detect regions having a predefined set of characteristics such as complex motion or high contrast, for all kinds of videos. However, what is ‘interesting’ varies from one application to another. By learning features of regions that capture the attention of viewers while watching a video, we aim to distinguish those that are actually salient in the given context, from the rest. The integrated approach ensures that both regions with anticipated content (top–down attention) and unanticipated content (bottom–up attention) are predicted by the proposed framework as salient. In our experiments with news videos of popular channels, the results show a significant improvement in the identification of relevant salient regions in such videos, when compared with existing approaches.

TI  - An Intelligent Tutoring System and Teacher Dashboard to Support Mathematizing During Science Inquiry

SP  - 332

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Using mathematics is critical to science inquiry at the high school level and is predictive of students’ later success in STEM college majors and careers. Inq-ITS (Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System) has recently added mathematizing functionalities in order to support students in the mathematical practices needed for scientific inquiry, and our teacher alerting dashboard, Inq-Blotter, is being extended to alert teachers in real-time to students’ difficulties with this practice. Mathematizing in science can be challenging as students must attend to multiple sources of information (i.e., graphs, data tables), as well as do graphing and modeling. In the present paper, I describe three studies on the use of Inq-Blotter to support students on mathematizing in which I: (1) explore students’ eye-movements and think-aloud protocols while mathematizing in Inq-ITS to identify the proportion of mathematizing difficulties that are related to knowledge acquisition processes versus other mathematical competencies (e.g., graph building and modeling), (2) examine if alerts within Inq-Blotter permit teachers to identify students who need help most (relative to teachers without access to alerts), and (3) identify whether teacher support based on alerts leads to improvements on students’ next opportunity to engage in mathematizing and examine the corresponding teacher discourse associated with students’ gains. These studies will indicate how to support students on mathematizing with intelligent technologies.

AB  - A mammographic screening workstation has been developed in which CAD results for mass detection are presented fundamentally different than in current practice. Instead of displaying all CAD findings as prompts the reader can probe image regions for the presence of CAD information. The aim of the system is to help radiologists with decision making rather than avoiding oversight errors. In a preliminary observer study we studied the effect of using the interactive CAD system. Four non-radiologists and two radiologists participated. Each observer read 60 cases two times, once with and once without CAD. The set included 20 cases with subtle cancers that were missed at screening. It was found that performance of the readers increased significantly with interactive use of CAD.

AB  - Evaluating affective user experience in games is an important component of the growing field of game user research, because compelling gameplay experiences incorporate meaningful and, therefore, emotional player decisions. This makes evaluating player emotions and player visceral physiological reactions a fascinating field of study for game researchers. With their recent success in the human factors domain, physiological metrics, which complement game metrics, have been successfully used to study player engagement and emotion in research and industry. This chapter provides a brief introduction to and primer of physiological measures currently used in game research and discusses the benefits and challenges of this quantitative method of game user research.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a human-machine system (HMS) experiment, which was conducted to explore how to combine textual and graphical information in an interface. Specifically, this paper explored how the location of textual and graphical information would influence response time, accuracy and eye movement. We also explored the effectiveness of three different configurations (9, 16, and 25 points). Our findings suggest that if the accuracy was the highest priority, the textual information should be placed at the left side of the screen and the graphical information should not be placed at the center of the screen. If a quicker response time was the highest priority, the graphical information should not be placed at the corners and bottom right margins. Finally, if an interface includes both textual and graphical elements, graphical information could be placed at corner and margin areas and textual information could be placed at corner areas to facilitate the efficiency of information processing. From the perspective of response accuracy and response time, the 9-point configuration was most appropriate for the calibration process.

AB  - Eye tracking gives communication scholars the opportunity to move beyond self-reported measures by examining more precisely how much visual attention is paid to information. However, we lack insight into how eye-tracking data is used in communication research. This literature review provides an overview of how eye tracking is used in communication research by examining published articles from the top-25 ranked communication journals between 2005 and 2015. Our results showed that most eye-tracking research was employed in the field of advertising. Furthermore, most studies used eye tracking to measure (visual) attention and used this as the study’s dependent variable. A wide variety of eye-tracking measures were reported, including fixation time, fixation count, and visual shifts, and a wide variety of eye-tracking devices were used. Our results highlight opportunities for using eye tracking as well as identify other ways of using eye tracking to maximize its potential in communication research.

AB  - Brain-Neural Machine/Computer Interface (BNCI) has been used successfully as an assistive technology to restore communication, improve control and thus potentially enhance social inclusion. Recently BNCI technology and interfaces have evolved to become more usable, thereby allowing the recording of brain activity to become part of the wider self-quantification movement. A hybrid BNCI can provide a viable but alternative interface for Human Computer Interaction, which combines the inputs from BNCI and eye tracking. This hybrid approach has maintained information transfer rate but increased robustness and overall usability. The combination of two complementary technologies provides the possibility for investigating new ways of human enhancement and has the potential to open up new medical applications.

AB  - Affect is prevalent in learning and it influences students’ learning achievement. This paper details the design and evaluation of an Affective Tutoring System (ATS) that tutors student in computer programming. Although most ATSs are purpose built for a specific domain, making adaptation to another domain difficult, this ATS is architected for adaptability and extensibility. This study also addresses a lack of research exploring the theories and methods of integrating affect and learning within the learning process by proposing methods of regulating the negative affect of students. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used for evaluation of the effectiveness of the ATS and its usability and acceptance by student participants. The results revealed that the full affective version of the ATS results in more effective tutoring as compared to the version with the affective function disabled and the students are positive on their learning experience with the ATS with the fill in the gap exercises and hints being most highly rated.

VL  - 15
IS  - 2
AB  - In this paper, we report on a prototype augmented reality (AR) platform for accessing abstract information in real-world pervasive computing environments. Using this platform, objects, people, and the environment serve as contextual channels to more information. The user’s interest with respect to the environment is inferred from eye movement patterns, speech, and other implicit feedback signals, and these data are used for information filtering. The results of proactive context-sensitive information retrieval are augmented onto the view of a handheld or head-mounted display or uttered as synthetic speech. The augmented information becomes part of the user’s context, and if the user shows interest in the AR content, the system detects this and provides progressively more information. In this paper, we describe the first use of the platform to develop a pilot application, Virtual Laboratory Guide, and early evaluation results of this application.

SP  - 493

VL  - 15
IS  - 5
AB  - Design patterns are recognized in the software engineering community as useful solutions to recurring design problems that improve the quality of programs. They are more and more used by developers in the design and implementation of their programs. Therefore, the visualization of the design patterns used in a program could be useful to efficiently understand how it works. Currently, a common representation to visualize design patterns is the UML collaboration notation. Previous work noticed some limitations in the UML representation and proposed new representations to tackle these limitations. However, none of these pieces of work conducted empirical studies to compare their new representations with the UML representation. We designed and conducted an empirical study to collect data on the performance of developers on basic tasks related to design pattern comprehension (i.e., identifying composition, role, participation) to evaluate the impact of three visual representations and to compare them with the UML one. We used eye-trackers to measure the developers’ effort during the execution of the study. Collected data and their analyses show that stereotype-enhanced UML diagrams are more efficient for identifying composition and role than the UML collaboration notation. The UML representation and the pattern-enhanced class diagrams are more efficient for locating the classes participating in a design pattern (i.e., identifying participation).

TI  - An empirical study on the importance of source code entities for requirements traceability
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 442
EP  - 478
VL  - 20
IS  - 2
AB  - Requirements Traceability (RT) links help developers during program comprehension and maintenance tasks. However, creating RT links is a laborious and resource-consuming task. Information Retrieval (IR) techniques are useful to automatically create traceability links. However, IR-based techniques typically have low accuracy (precision, recall, or both) and thus, creating RT links remains a human intensive process. We conjecture that understanding how developers verify RT links could help improve the accuracy of IR-based RT techniques to create RT links. Consequently, we perform an empirical study consisting of four case studies. First, we use an eye-tracking system to capture developers’ eye movements while they verify RT links. We analyse the obtained data to identify and rank developers’ preferred types of Source Code Entities (SCEs), e.g., domain vs. implementation-level source code terms and class names vs. method names. Second, we perform another eye-tracking case study to confirm that it is the semantic content of the developers’ preferred types of SCEs and not their locations that attract developers’ attention and help them in their task to verify RT links. Third, we propose an improved term weighting scheme, i.e., Developers Preferred Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (D P T F / I D F), that uses the knowledge of the developers’ preferred types of SCEs to give more importance to these SCEs into the term weighting scheme. We integrate thisweighting scheme with an IR technique, i.e., Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), to create a new technique to RT link recovery. Using three systems (iTrust, Lucene, and Pooka), we show that the proposed technique statistically improves the accuracy of the recovered RT links over a technique based on LSI and the usual Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (T F / I D F) weighting scheme. Finally, we compare the newly proposed D P T F / I D F with our original Domain Or Implementation/Inverse Document Frequency (D O I / I D F) weighting scheme.

TI  - An experimental investigation on the effects of context on source code identifiers splitting and expansion
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1706
EP  - 1753
VL  - 19
IS  - 6
AB  - Recent and past studies indicate that source code lexicon plays an important role in program comprehension. Developers often compose source code identifiers with abbreviated words and acronyms, and do not always use consistent mechanisms and explicit separators when creating identifiers. Such choices and inconsistencies impede the work of developers that must understand identifiers by decomposing them into their component terms, and mapping them onto dictionary, application or domain words. When software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available, developers must therefore use the available contextual information to understand the source code. This paper aims at investigating how developers split and expand source code identifiers, and, specifically, the extent to which different kinds of contextual information could support such a task. In particular, we consider (i) an internal context consisting of the content of functions and source code files in which the identifiers are located, and (ii) an external context involving external documentation. We conducted a family of two experiments with 63 participants, including bachelor, master, Ph.D. students, and post-docs. We randomly sampled a set of 50 identifiers from a corpus of open source C programs and we asked participants to split and expand them with the availability (or not) of internal and external contexts. We report evidence on the usefulness of contextual information for identifier splitting and acronym/abbreviation expansion. We observe that the source code files are more helpful than just looking at function source code, and that the application-level contextual information does not help any further. The availability of external sources of information only helps in some circumstances. Also, in some cases, we observe that participants better expanded acronyms than abbreviations, although in most cases both exhibit the same level of accuracy. Finally, results indicated that the knowledge of English plays a significant effect in identifier splitting/expansion. The obtained results confirm the conjecture that contextual information is useful in program comprehension, including when developers split and expand identifiers to understand them. We hypothesize that the integration of identifier splitting and expansion tools with IDE could help to improve developers’ productivity.

EP  - 2412
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
AB  - Frameworks are widely used in modern software development to reduce development costs. They are accessed through their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which specify the contracts with client programs. When frameworks evolve, API backward-compatibility cannot always be guaranteed and client programs must upgrade to use the new releases. Because framework upgrades are not cost-free, observing API changes and usages together at fine-grained levels is necessary to help developers understand, assess, and forecast the cost of each framework upgrade. Whereas previous work studied API changes in frameworks and API usages in client programs separately, we analyse and classify API changes and usages together in 22 framework releases from the Apache and Eclipse ecosystems and their client programs. We find that (1) missing classes and methods happen more often in frameworks and affect client programs more often than the other API change types do, (2) missing interfaces occur rarely in frameworks but affect client programs often, (3) framework APIs are used on average in 35 % of client classes and interfaces, (4) most of such usages could be encapsulated locally and reduced in number, and (5) about 11 % of APIs usages could cause ripple effects in client programs when these APIs change. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for developers and researchers to reduce the impact of API evolution through language mechanisms and design strategies.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 243
EP  - 275
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
AB  - Antipatterns are poor design choices that are conjectured to make object-oriented systems harder to maintain. We investigate the impact of antipatterns on classes in object-oriented systems by studying the relation between the presence of antipatterns and the change- and fault-proneness of the classes. We detect 13 antipatterns in 54 releases of ArgoUML, Eclipse, Mylyn, and Rhino, and analyse (1) to what extent classes participating in antipatterns have higher odds to change or to be subject to fault-fixing than other classes, (2) to what extent these odds (if higher) are due to the sizes of the classes or to the presence of antipatterns, and (3) what kinds of changes affect classes participating in antipatterns. We show that, in almost all releases of the four systems, classes participating in antipatterns are more change-and fault-prone than others. We also show that size alone cannot explain the higher odds of classes with antipatterns to underwent a (fault-fixing) change than other classes. Finally, we show that structural changes affect more classes with antipatterns than others. We provide qualitative explanations of the increase of change- and fault-proneness in classes participating in antipatterns using release notes and bug reports. The obtained results justify a posteriori previous work on the specification and detection of antipatterns and could help to better focus quality assurance and testing activities.

AB  - Relevance feedback is an efficient approach to improve the performance of content-based image retrieval systems, and implicit relevance feedback approaches, which gather users’ feedback by biometric devices (e.g. eye tracker), have extensively investigated in recent years. This paper proposes a novel image retrieval system with implicit relevance feedback, named eye tracking based relevance feedback system (ETRFs). ETRFs is composed of three main modules: image retrieval subsystem based on bag-of-word architecture; user relevance assessment that implicitly acquires relevant images with the help of a modern eye tracker; and relevance feedback module that applies a weighted query expansion method to fuse users’ relevance feedback. ETRFs is implemented online and real-time, which makes it remarkably distinguish from other offline systems. Ten subjects participate our experiments on the dataset of Oxford buildings and UKBench. The experimental results demonstrate that ETRFs achieves notable improvement for image retrieval performance.

AB  - Eye gaze tracking is very useful for quantitatively measuring visual attention in virtual environments. However, most eye trackers have a limited tracking range, e.g., ±35° in the horizontal direction. This paper proposed a method to combine head pose tracking and eye gaze tracking together to achieve a large range of tracking in virtual driving simulation environments. Multiple parallel multilayer perceptrons were used to reconstruct the relationship between head images and head poses. Head images were represented with the coefficients extracted from Principal Component Analysis. Eye gaze tracking provides precise results on the front view, while head pose tracking is more suitable for tracking areas of interest than for tracking points of interest on the side view.

SP  - 15

VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Train driving is primarily a visual task; train drivers are required to monitor the dynamic scene visually both outside and inside the train cab. Poor performance on this visual task may lead to errors, such as signals passed at danger. It is therefore important to understand the visual strategies that train drivers employ when monitoring and searching the visual scene for key items, such as signals. Prior to this investigation, a pilot study had already been carried out using an eye tracking technique to investigate train drivers’ visual behaviour and to collect data on driver monitoring of the visual environment, Groeger et al. (2003) Pilot study of train drivers’ eye movements, University of Surrey. However, a larger set of data was needed in order to understand more fully train driver visual behaviour and strategies. In light of this need, the Transport Research Laboratory produced a methodology for the assessment of UK train driver visual strategies, on behalf of the Rail Safety and Standards Board and applied this methodology to conduct a large-scale trial. The study collected a wealth of data on train drivers’ visual behaviour with the aim of providing a greater understanding of the strategies adopted. The corneal dark-eye tracking system chosen for these trials tracks human visual search and scanning patterns, and was fitted to 86 drivers whilst driving in-service trains. Data collected include the duration and frequency of glances made towards different elements of the visual scene. In addition, the train drivers were interviewed after driving the routes, to try and understand the thought processes behind the behaviour observed. Statistical analysis of over 600 signal approaches was conducted. This analysis revealed that signal aspect, preceding signal aspect, signal type and signal complexity are important factors, which affect the visual behaviour of train drivers. Train driver interview data revealed that driver expectation also plays a significant role in train driving. The findings of this study have implications for the rail industry in terms of infrastructure design, design of the driving task and driver training. However, train driving is extremely complex and the data from this study only begin to describe and explain train driver visual strategies in the specific context of signal approaches. This study has provided a wealth of data and further analysis of it is needed to investigate the role of other factors and the complex relationships between factors during signal approaches and other driving situations systematically. Finally, there are important aspects of visual behaviour that cannot be examined using these data or this method. Investigation of other aspects of visual behaviour, such as peripheral vision, will require other methods such as simulation.

AB  - In this paper, we report on user behaviors by analyzing visual clues while users are watching various TV broadcast in pilot settings. We detail the first results of the empathic analysis of viewers watching four distinct videos in dedicated recording sessions. Viewers are sitting in front of a TV set in unconstrained position (free postures, free head poses and free body movements) on a chair and recorded by a regular webcam at both low and high resolutions. We have extracted metrics related to: head and global movement, changes in head orientation and facial expressions (happy, angry, surprise). We have conducted preliminary studies about how the extracted metrics can be employed in order to detect the interest, the amusement or the distraction of a viewer.

AB  - In this paper we propose a complete methodology of printed text characterization for document labeling using texture features that have been inspired by a psychovisual approach. This approach considers visual human-based predicates to describe and identify text units according to their visual saliency and their perceptual attraction power on the reader’s eye. It supports a quick and robust process of functional labeling used to characterize text regions of document pages. The test databases are the Finland MTDB Oulu base J. Sauvola and H. Kauniskangas (1999) MediaTeam Document Database II, a CD-ROM document image collection, Oulu University, Finland that provides a great panel of document layouts and contents and our laboratory corpus that contains a large variety of composite documents (about 200 pages). The performance of the method gives very promising results.

AB  - Marketing and promotions of various consumer products through advertisement campaign is a well known practice to increase the sales and awareness amongst the consumers. This essentially leads to increase in profit to a manufacturing unit. Re-production of products usually depends on the various facts including consumption in the market, reviewer’s comments, ratings, etc. However, knowing consumer preference for decision making and behavior prediction for effective utilization of a product using unconscious processes is called “Neuromarketing”. This field is emerging fast due to its inherent potential. Therefore, research work in this direction is highly demanded, yet not reached a satisfactory level. In this paper, we propose a predictive modeling framework to understand consumer choice towards E-commerce products in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG signals. The EEG signals of volunteers with varying age and gender were recorded while they browsed through various consumer products. The experiments were performed on the dataset comprised of various consumer products. The accuracy of choice prediction was recorded using a user-independent testing approach with the help of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier. We have observed that the prediction results are promising and the framework can be used for better business model.

AB  - In the time of affordable and comfortable video-based eye tracking, the need for analysis software becomes more and more important. We introduce Eyetrace, a new software developed for the analysis of eye-tracking data during static image viewing. The aim of the software is to provide a platform for eye-tracking data analysis which works with different eye trackers, offering thus the possibility to compare results beyond the specific characteristics of the hardware devices. Furthermore, by integrating various state-of-the-art and new developed algorithms for analysis and visualization of eye-tracking data, the influence of different analysis steps and parameter choices on typical eye-tracking measures is totally transparent to the user. Eyetrace integrates several algorithms to identify fixations and saccades, and to cluster them. Well-established algorithms can be used side-by-side with bleeding-edge approaches with a continuous visualization. Eyetrace can be downloaded at http://www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/Eyetrace.1751.0.htmland we encourage its use for exploratory data analysis and education.

AB  - Understanding of human perception of textured materials is one of the most difficult tasks of computer vision. In this paper we designed a strictly controlled psychophysical experiment with stimuli featuring different combinations of shape, illumination directions and surface texture. Appearance of five tested materials was represented by measured view and illumination dependent Bidirectional Texture Functions. Twelve subjects participated in visual search task - to find which of four identical three dimensional objects had its texture modified. We investigated the effect of shape and texture on subjects’ attention. We are not looking at low level salience, as the task is to make a high level quality judgment. Our results revealed several interesting aspects of human perception of different textured materials and, surface shapes.

AB  - Studies related to measuring user satisfaction with soft drinks PET packaging are still scarce, especially when related to users’ actual performance in the act of opening screw caps. Although there are usability techniques that evaluate a user’s experience by using the process for conceptualizing and evaluating consumer products, the researcher does not always have factual knowledge about whether or not the experience reported by the user at the time of the research fully matches what the user actually experienced. This study conducted a usability evaluation of how a sample of users manually handled PET bottles for soft drinks by making a comparison between the experience as reported by the user and the real experience that the user underwent by using three techniques to measure them, namely usability analysis, eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG).

TI  - Analysis of conversational listening skills toward agent-based social skills training
JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
AB  - Listening skills are critical for human communication. Social skills training (SST), performed by human trainers, is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches speaking skills through interaction with a computer agent. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training considered speaking skills, the SST framework incorporates other skills, such as listening, asking questions, and expressing discomfort. In this paper, we extend our automated social skills training by considering user listening skills during conversations with computer agents. We prepared two scenarios: Listening 1 and Listening 2, which respectively assume small talk and job training. A female agent spoke to the participants about a recent story and how to make a telephone call, and the participants listened. We recorded the data of 27 Japanese graduate students who interacted with the agent. Two expert external raters assessed the participants’ listening skills. We manually extracted features that might be related to the eye fixation and behavioral cues of the participants and confirmed that a simple linear regression with selected features correctly predicted listening skills with a correlation coefficient above 0.50 in both scenarios. The number of noddings and backchannels within the utterances contributes to the predictions because we found that just using these two features predicted listening skills with a correlation coefficient above 0.43. Since these two features are easier to understand for users, we plan to integrate them into the framework of automated social skills training.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to model manual submarine steering and its effects on helmsmen in terms of performance and mental workload. This activity is first formalized according to (a) cognitive requirements, by identifying different levels of control, and (b) perceptual–motor requirements, by analysing the directional compatibility of control–display design. An experiment is then carried out on a simulator designed by a world leader in military naval shipbuilding. This experiment follows a unique scenario including two driving situations with different levels of cognitive requirements (approach and stabilization phases). It is achieved by two groups, each carrying out a perceptual–motor task on a specific steering control–display configuration proposed by the naval shipbuilder (one with a standard numeric display and one with a new visual–spatial representation, both tasks controlled by the same joystick). The findings of this study show that the cognitive requirements during the stabilization phase with high propulsion speed produce increased mental workload, and the perceptual–motor requirements also produce increased mental workload when a direction-of-motion stereotype is violated (upward–forward relationship).

AB  - Assistive technologies have been used to improve the quality of life of people who have been diagnosed with health issues. In this case, we aim to use an assistive technology in the shape of an affective avatar to help people who have been diagnosed with different forms of Social Communications Disorders (SCD). The designed avatar presents a humanoid face that displays emotions with a subtlety akin to that of real life human emotions, with those emotions changing according to the interactions that the user chooses to perform on the avatar. We have used Blender for the design of the emotions, which are happiness, sadness, surprise, fear and anger, plus a neutral emotion, while Unity was used to dictate the behavior of the avatar when the interactions were performed, which could be positive (caress), negative (poke) or neutral (wait). The avatar has been evaluated by 48 people from different backgrounds and the results show the overall positive reception by the users, as well as the difference between neurotypical and non-neurotypical users in terms of emotion recognition and chosen interactions. A ground truth has been established in terms of prototypic empathic interactions by the users.

AB  - Some programming learners in the lowest achievement group do not have even a minimum skill to read a simple program correctly. Reading programs would be an essential programming learning. To efficiently support learners in the lowest group, firstly we should conduct a fundamental analysis of reading programs to unveil their features. Therefore, the authors focused on eye tracking as a method to carry out the idea. The authors have thought that utilizing eye movement helps to clarify the reasons for making programming learning difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of learner’s program comprehension process based on the pattern of eye movement, not the eye distribution during reading source code. In this paper, we first measure the data of eye movement during reading some source codes and propose a modeling method to represent the feature of eye movement. Then we design an experimental protocol for analyzing eye movement based on program structure. The experiment of this paper focuses on source codes based on four types of data dependency relationship that can be generated by three lines of assignment statement only. As the analysis result, we confirmed that the data dependence of each pattern appeared as the unique eye behavior of program reading.

AB  - In a study of the American Community Survey online instrument, we assessed how people answered questions about themselves and other individuals living in their household using eye-tracking data and other qualitative measures. This paper focuses on the number of fixations (whether participants looked at specific areas of the screen), fixation duration (how long participants looked at the questions and answers), and number of unique visits (whether participants rechecked the question and answer options). Results showed that for age, date of birth and employment duty questions participants had more fixations and unique visit counts, and spent more time on the screen when answering about unrelated members of their household than when answering about themselves. Differing eye movements for proxy reporting suggest that answering some survey questions for other unrelated people poses more burden on respondents than answering about oneself. However, not all questions showed this tendency, so eye tracking alone is not enough to detect burden.

AB  - Four decades of sporadic invention and experimentation of and with non-traditional human-computer interface schemes have congealed (somewhat abruptly though not without a few clear-sighted antecedents) into a new field of information system design, here calledAntisedentary Beigeless Computing, that consciously rejects the traditional conception of isolated tete-a-tete between the human and the box-CRT-keyboardmouse. ABC systems instead favour the complementary directions away from this notion of an immobile info-shrine: more personal, intimate, and portable information access; and more diffuse, environmentally-integrated information access. Consideration of ABC projects to date seems to suggest that no single instance can alone express the full generality required of a ‘working’ information system, so that (on the one hand) system design must acknowledge that a complex set of trade-offs involving capabilities, universality, specificity, personalization, and generality is inescapable; while (on the other hand) an ideal, eventual ‘information environment’ will inevitably comprise the careful interweaving of some number of individual ABC systems.

AB  - With interactive evolutionary computation it is possible to introduce the subjective preferences of the decision maker within the general algorithm evolution criteria. The problem that generates this is user fatigue, since it has to evaluate a considerable number of plants designs in each generation. To avoid user fatigue it is proposed to substitute the direct evaluation through the mouse by means of a numerical scale by an eye tracking system in which the system “captures” the evaluation that the user assigns to the plants through the gaze behavior. This article presents a first approximation to this solution. The results obtained in the experiments are promising and a clear relationship between the parameters that define the gaze behavior of the user with the score assigned to the designs can be seen.

AB  - This chapter presents an overview on applications of eye-tracking technology in natural language processing (NLP) and other areas. While traditional NLP techniques mostly rely on the textual properties, recent research has shown that human behavioral data collected through technologies like eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) along with textual representations help improve performances of NLP systems. Our survey focuses particularly on eye-tracking technology and summarizes various methods proposed to include eye-movement data in different components of NLP pipeline viz. annotation, classification, and evaluation. A significant portion of this chapter is also devoted to more than three decades of eye-movement research and development in the fields of psychology, psycholinguistics, neuroscience, industrial engineering, marketing, user experience design, to build a perspective on why eye-movement information can be effective toward solving important problems in different research areas.

AB  - In both research and practice, translation quality assessment is a complex task involving a range of linguistic and extra-linguistic factors. This chapter provides a critical overview of the established and developing approaches to the definition and measurement of translation quality in human and machine translation workflows across a range of research, educational, and industry scenarios. We intertwine literature from several interrelated disciplines dealing with contemporary translation quality assessment and, while we acknowledge the need for diversity in these approaches, we argue that there are fundamental and widespread issues that remain to be addressed, if we are to consolidate our knowledge and practice of translation quality assessment in increasingly technologised environments across research, teaching, and professional practice.

AB  - Grasping and manual interaction for robots so far has largely been approached with an emphasis on physics and control aspects. Given the richness of human manual interaction, we argue for the consideration of the wider field of “manual intelligence” as a perspective for manual action research that brings the cognitive nature of human manual skills to the foreground. We briefly sketch part of a research agenda along these lines, argue for the creation of a manual interaction database as an important cornerstone of such an agenda, and describe the manual interaction lab recently set up at CITEC to realize this goal and to connect the efforts of robotics and cognitive science researchers towards making progress for a more integrated understanding of manual intelligence.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper investigates whether immediate impression about websites influences only perceptions of attractiveness. The evaluative constructs of perceived usability, credibility and novelty were investigated alongside visual appeal in an experimental setting in which users evaluated 20 website screenshots in two phases. The websites were rated by the participants after viewing time of 500 ms in the first phase and with no time limit in the second. Within-website and within-rater consistency were examined in order to determine whether extremely short time period are enough to quickly form stable opinions about high level evaluative constructs besides visual appeal. We confirmed that quick and stable visual appeal judgments were made without the need of elaborate investigations and found evidence that this is also true for novelty. Usability and credibility judgments were found less consistent but nonetheless noteworthy.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this study we tested whether external regulation provided by artificial pedagogical agents (PAs) was effective in facilitating learners’ self-regulated learning (SRL) and can therefore foster complex learning with a hypermedia-based intelligent tutoring system. One hundred twenty (N = 120) college students learned about the human circulatory system with MetaTutor during a 2-hour session under one of two conditions: adaptive scaffolding (AS) or a control (C) condition. The AS condition received timely prompts from four PAs to deploy various cognitive and metacognitive SRL processes, and received immediate directive feedback concerning the deployment of the processes. By contrast, the C condition learned without assistance from the PAs. Results indicated that those in the AS condition gained significantly more knowledge about the science topic than those in the C condition. In addition, log-file data provided evidence of the effectiveness of the PAs’ scaffolding and feedback in facilitating learners’ (in the AS condition) metacognitive monitoring and regulation during learning. We discuss implications for the design of external regulation by PAs necessary to accurately detect, track, model, and foster learners’ SRL by providing more accurate and intelligent prompting, scaffolding, and feedback regarding SRL processes.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Information scent of hyperlinks, that is the user’s assessment of semantic relevance of navigation options in a webpage, has been identified as a critical factor in Web navigation. An important question in this context is to identify the minimum number of participants required to measure reliably information scent. A two phase study was conducted in an attempt to provide an answer to this question. In the first phase, involving 101 participants, ratings produced by different size subsets of participants were compared to those of the whole set. In the second phase, the ratings of these different size subsets of participants where compared with measures of behavior of 54 participants, who performed the same information navigation tasks using a typical web browser. Results indicate that representative estimates of information scent can be obtained from 10 participants in both cases. This finding has important implications for future scent-related studies.

AB  - Human society is increasingly dependent on artifacts. The progress of artificial intelligence accelerates this tendency. In spite of strong concern about heavy dependence on artifacts, it appears an inevitable consequence of the knowledge society. In this chapter, I am seeking a better way of living with advanced artifacts to realize an artifact-mediated society where people are supported by human-centered socially-adequate artifacts. The proposed framework consists of surrogates that work on behalf of the user and mediators that moderate or negotiate interactions among surrogates. I survey recent work in social intelligence design, and discuss technological challenges and opportunities in this direction.

EP  - 160
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The artistic painting by reference images is to convert the source input images into the corresponding paintings with the desired artistic effects. From the point of view of research methodology, the existing work can be summarized into three categories:(1)The reference images are taken as source images, and then the artistic processing techniques (e.g., half-tone, heuristic image processing rules, empirical stroke-generation techniques, etc.) are employed to transform the reference images into the resulting painting in terms of the user specified rendering styles, and other parameters, to control the visual effect.(2)The reference images are used to directly specify the desired visual effects or artistic features, which are extracted from reference images and then matched to that in the input source images. A computational model of feature association between input and reference images is then built, which will accordingly synthesize the resulting painting via optimization techniques.(3)A set of reference images is used to implicitly specify the association relationship of visual effect between source and target images. Then the analogy-based learning techniques are employed to automatically convert the newly input images into the resulting painting with the desired visual effect consistent with the relationship among the reference images.

AB  - In this article we present a long-term, continuous human-robot co-habitation experiment, which involved two professional artists, whose artistic work explores the boundary between science and society. The artists lived in the University of Hertfordshire Robot House full-time with various robots with different characteristics in a smart home environment. The artists immersed themselves in the robot populated living environment in order to explore and develop novel ways to interact with robots. The main research aim was to explore in a qualitative way the impact of a continuous weeklong exposure to robot companions and sensor environments on humans. This work has developed an Integrative Holistic Feedback Approach (IHFA) involving knowledgeable users in the design process of appearances, functionality and interactive behaviour of robots.

VL  - 76
IS  - 8
AB  - Salient region detection has gradually become a popular topic in multimedia and computer vision research. However, existing techniques exhibit remarkable variations in methodology with inherent pros and cons. In this paper, we propose fusing the saliency hypotheses, namely the saliency maps produced by different methods, by accentuating their advantages and attenuating the disadvantages. To this end, our algorithm consists of three basic steps. First, given the test image, our method finds the similar images and their saliency hypotheses by comparing the similarity of the learned deep features. Second, the error-aware coefficients are computed from the saliency hypotheses. Third, our method produces a pixel-accurate saliency map which covers the objects of interest and exploits the advantages of the state-of-the-art methods. We then evaluate the proposed framework on three challenging datasets, namely MSRA-1000, ECSSD and iCoSeg. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we have applied our method to the SquareMe application, an autonomous image resizing system. The subjective user-study experiment demonstrates that human prefers the image retargeting results obtained by using the saliency maps from our proposed algorithm.

AB  - We present the architecture of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) based on common dual camera smartphones, emphasizing on the calibration procedure which is active during the initialization phase (prior to the actual driving). NAVIEYES project attempts to make use of the video information received from both the front and the rear cameras of the phone in order to infer and alert drivers upon potential dangerous situations. This study focuses on the information received from the front camera. 10 different mobile devices were tested, in order to choose the most powerful and ergonomic platform. A calibration experiment is carried by 22 subjects, and the first version of the application is tested using a driving simulator. The system is deployed on a real car, and several warning paradigms such as audio, video and mixed alerts are also analyzed. We present the HCI questionnaire, analyze the data and propose further developments.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - It could be advantageous in many situations for an adaptive hypermedia system to have information about the cognitive load that the user is currently experiencing. A literature review of the methods proposed to assess cognitive load reveals: (1) that pupil size seems to be one of the most promising indicators of cognitive load in applied contexts and (2) that its suitability for use as an on-line index in everyday situations has not yet been tested adequately. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of the pupil size index in such situations. To this end, pupil diameter and event-related brain potentials were measured while subjects read texts of different levels of difficulty. As had been hypothesized, more difficult texts led to lower reading speed, higher subjective load ratings, and a reduced P300 amplitude. But text difficulty, surprisingly, had no effect on pupil size. These results indicate that pupil size may not be suitable as an index of cognitive load for adaptive hypermedia systems. Instead, behavioral indicators such as reading speed may be more suitable.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between participants’ self-reported high verbal or high visual information preferences and their performance and eye movements during analytical reasoning problems. Twelve participants, six male and six female, were selected as being more visual than verbal or more verbal than visual in approach, based on the results of a questionnaire administered to 140 college students. Selected participants were tested for individual differences in spatial ability and working memory capacity. They completed a repeated measures experiment while their eye movements were tracked to examine any correlation with their stated preference for verbal or visual information presentation. Performance on analytical reasoning problems with and without an optional diagram is compared between groups and within-subjects. Due to the small number of participants, between-group differences, although indicated, were mostly statistically insignificant. Within-subject analysis is still being completed, but trends in diagram usage are examined.

Experimental data were gathered from 15 participants using an eye tracker. We present by using gaze data that the proposed approach can be reliably applied to eye movement sequence comparison. Our results have implications for improving novice clinicians’ reasoning abilities in particular and enhancing students’ learning outcomes in general.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) technologies, more efforts have been going into developing new input methods. While physical controllers are widely used, more novel techniques, such as eye tracking, are now commercially available. In our work, we investigate the use of physiological signals as input to enhance VR experiences. We present a system using gaze tracking and electromyography on a user’s forearm to make selection tasks in virtual spaces more efficient. In a study with 16 participants, we compared five different input techniques using a Fitts’ law task: Using gaze tracking for cursor movement in combination with forearm contractions for making selections was superior to using an HTC Vive controller, Xbox gamepad, dwelling time, and eye-gaze dwelling time. To explore application scenarios and collect qualitative feedback, we further developed and evaluated a game with our input technique. Our findings inform the design of applications that use eye-gaze tracking and forearm muscle movements for effective user input in VR.

SP  - 449
EP  - 465
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) enables approaches to altitudes closer to the runway that would otherwise be precluded due to low visibility ceilings. EFVS in flight cockpits has the potential to augment the safety in flight operations and enable improved crew performance during approach and landing phases of flight irrespective of the visibility conditions. EFVS utilizes imaging sensors capable of penetrating through obscuring weather conditions, thereby providing forward vision of the runway environment in real-time for display on a heads-up display (HUD). As EFVS potentially moves into use in general aviation operations, it is necessary to evaluate the associated human performance implications, especially during off-nominal conditions as most of the previous studies were primarily limited to nominal cases. The study of off-nominal cases was limited to only HUD failures. The objective of this paper is to present a detailed experimental plan, with preliminary results, to evaluate the human factors implications in using the EFVS under off-nominal conditions. A human-in-the-loop experiment will be conducted in a fixed-base simulator modeled with EFVS. Evaluation pilots will fly six different experimental trials with two visibility levels and three levels of information quality: No-EFVS, EFVS with correct information, and EFVS with degraded information. Measures of performance include approach and landing performance, visual performance, workload, and decision-making.

AB  - Event-related potentials (ERP) are usually studied by means of their grand averages, or, like in brain-machine interfaces (BMI), classified on a single-trial level. Both approaches do not offer a detailed insight into the individual, qualitative variations of the ERP occurring between single trials. These variations, however, convey valuable information on subtle but relevant differences in the neural processes that generate these potentials. Understanding these differences is even more important when ERP are studied in more complex, natural and real-life scenarios, which is essential to improve and extend current BMI. We propose an approach for assessing these variations, namely amplitude, latency and morphology, in a recently introduced ERP, fixation-related potentials (FRP). To this end, we conducted a study with a complex, real-world like choice task to acquire FRP data. Then, we present our method based on multiple-linear regression and outline, how this method may be used for a detailed, qualitative analysis of single-trial FRP data.

AB  - The impairment of basic cognitive functions such as attention and visual working memory can have a significant negative impact in our ability to adapt to the permanent changes in the environment. VR Serious Games are being used as a new tool for both assessment, stimulation and rehabilitation of such impaired functions. Even though the results of these novel applications seem to be promising, some of the assessments based in these solutions use indirect measures to evaluate attentional and mnesic performance (e.g. number of errors, task completion time). Gaze tracking (GT) can provide more accurate and direct indicators of these cognitive processes. On a sample of 46 non-clinical participants (33 Female; 71.7%), with an age average of 27.96 years old (SD = 11.92), ocular movements were recorded in two different comparative visual search tasks (CVSTs) that are an integrant part of the cognitive assessment protocol of the Systemic Lisbon Battery (SLB). Number of visits and total fixations differed based on the assessment with the Mini-mental state examination test (MMSE). These results highlight the possibility of combining both the data from the GT and the results of the “spot the differences” tasks in SLB, adding an unobtrusive and reliable solution for cognitive assessment in clinical and non-clinical settings.

AB  - ‘Big data’ is a phrase that has gained much traction recently. It has been defined as ‘a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate and there are challenges with analysis, searching and visualization’ [1]. Many domains struggle with providing experts accurate visualizations of massive data sets so that the experts can understand and make decisions about the data e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5].

AB  - Assessment of maritime training has been a growth in collaborations between nautical instructors and researchers in marine operations. Through a qualitative study and using eye tracking data, this paper presents a case study wherein the relations between communications and visual focus in dynamic positioning (DP) operations in maritime operations are examined. We investigated how communication and visual focus are related to DP operations in a team of marine operators. The results show that communications and visual focus do affect marine operations in the consistency, conciseness and maximum effect of communication skills through two rules—(1) the effectiveness of communications and visual information from eyes, (2) the goldfish memory skills for communications.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - When integrating numerous in-car information and assistance systems, a consistent way of spatial distance presentation for drivers is required. A common practice is to use discrete textual information (e.g. 500 meters) in combination with a graphical bar representing relative spatial information. Hitherto there exists no design consistency with respect to bars for distance illustration. Contemporary solutions differ in terms of movement direction (upward vs. downward), composition type (decreasing vs. increasing), or alignment (horizontal vs. vertical). We conducted a driving simulator experiment to investigate user preferences, perceived location, and eye gaze data for a meaningful subset of bars in a dynamic scenario. When approaching a traffic event (road works), one out of four vertical bar alternatives indicated the current distance. Subsequently, the associated horizontal bar type (decreasing or increasing) visualized the driver’s spatial progress within the road works section. Our results indicate, that drivers prefer upwards-moving approach bars and progress bars decreasing from left to right. Eye-tracking data supports usage of decreasing bars instead of increasing bars. Accordingly, we elaborated an initial version of design guidelines for bars representing relative spatial information for local events. On this basis we implemented approach and progress indicators, which were adopted for numerous use-cases in a large field operational test for Vehicle-2-X Communication.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Technological interventions for teaching children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are becoming popular due to their potentials for sustaining the attention of children with rich multimedia and repetitive functionalities. The degree of attentiveness to these technological interventions differs from one child to another due to variability in the spectrum. Therefore, an objective approach, as opposed to the subjective type of attention assessment, becomes essential for automatically monitoring attention in order to design and develop adaptive learning tools, as well as to support caregivers to evaluate learning tools. The analysis of facial expressions recently emerged as an objective method of measuring attention and participation levels of typical learners. However, few studies have examined facial expressions of children with ASD during an attention task. Thus, this study aims to evaluate existing facial expression parameters developed by “affectiva”, a commercial engagement level measuring tool. We conducted fifteen experimental scenarios of 5 min each with 4 children with ASD and 4 typically developing children with an average age of 8.8 years, A desktop virtual reality-continuous performance task (VR-CPT) as attention stimuli and a webcam were used to stream real-time facial expressions. All the participants scored above average in the VR-CPT and the performance of the TD group was better than that of ASD. While 3 out of 10 facial expressions were prominent in the two groups, ASD group showed addition facial expression. Our findings showed that facial expression could serve as a biomarker for measuring attention differentiating the groups.

AB  - The task of selecting one among several items in a visual display is extremely common in daily life and is executed billions of times every day on the Web. Attention is vital for selection, but the end-to-end process of what draws and sustains attention, and how that influences selection, remains poorly understood. We study this in a complex multi-item selection setting, where participants selected one among eight news articles presented in a grid layout on a screen. By varying the position, saliency, and topic of the news items, we identify the relative importance of these visual and semantic factors in attention and selection. We present a simple model of attention that predicts many key features such as attention shifts and dwell time per item. Potential applications of our findings include optimizing visual displays to drive user attention.

AB  - In this chapter we analyze the attention of users on the move towards pervasive advertising media. We report the findings of two multi-sensor eye tracking studies designed to provide a better understanding of the actual attentional behavior of users on the move in different public environments. In the first study 106 participants were equipped with eye tracking technology and asked to use public transportation vehicles equipped with information and advertising screens. In a second study 16 participants were asked to stroll through a shopping street for about 15 min, and during this time different indicators for their behavior and focus of attention (eye tracking, movement and pose tracking) were captured. Motion and pose data was correlated with eye tracking data to identify typical patterns of attention. We report the results of these studies, then discuss the implications of the main findings for pervasive advertising and finally reflect on the used research methodology.

AB  - The paper describes an infotainment application where life-like characters present two MP3 players in a virtual showroom. The key feature of the system is that the presenter agents analyze the user’s gaze-behavior in real-time and may thus adapt the presentation flow accordingly. In particular, a user’s (non-)interest in interface objects and also preference in decision situations is estimated automatically by just using eye gaze as input modality. A formal study was conducted that compared two versions of the application. Results indicate that attentive presentation agents support successful grounding of deictic agent gestures and natural gaze behavior.

It has attracted intensive research in different fields such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia. While many such computational models exist, the focused study of what and how applications can be beneficial is still lacking. In this article, our ultimate goal is thus to provide a comprehensive review of the applications using saliency cues, the so-called attentive systems. We would like to provide a broad vision about saliency applications and what visual saliency can do. We categorize the vast amount of applications into different areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia. Intensively covering 200+ publications we survey (1) key application trends, (2) the role of visual saliency, and (3) the usability of saliency into different tasks.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 339
EP  - 354
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Attentive user interfaces (AUIs) capitalize on the rich information that can be obtained from users’ gaze behavior in order to infer relevant aspects of their cognitive state. Not only is eye gaze an excellent clue to states of interest and intention, but also to preference and confidence in comprehension. AUIs are built with the aim of adapting the interface to the user’s current information need, and thus reduce workload of interaction. Given those characteristics, it is believed that AUIs can have particular benefits for users with severe disabilities, for whom operating a physical device (like a mouse pointer) might be very strenuous or infeasible. This paper presents three studies that attempt to gauge uncertainty and intention on the part of the user from gaze data, and compare the success of each approach. The paper discusses how the application of the approaches adopted in each study to user interfaces can support users with severe disabilities.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Despite well-developed cognitive control mechanisms in most adult healthy humans, attention can still be captured by irrelevant distracting stimuli occurring in the environment. However, when it comes to artificial agents, such as humanoid robots, one might assume that its attention is “programmed” to follow a task, thus, being distracted by attention-capturing stimuli would not be expected. We were interested in whether a behavior that reflects attentional capture in a humanoid robot would increase its perception as human-like. We implemented human behaviors in a virtual version of iCub robot. Twenty participants’ head movements were recorded, through an inertial sensor, during a solitaire card game, while a series of distracting videos were presented on a screen in their peripheral field of view. Eight participants were selected, and their behavioral reactions (i.e. inertial sensor coordinates, etc.) were extracted and implemented in the simulator. In Experiment 2, twenty-four new participants were asked to rate the human-likeness of the avatar movements. We examined whether movement parameters (i.e. angle amplitude, overall time spent on a distractor) influenced participants’ ratings of human-likeness, and if there was any correlation with sociodemographic factors (i.e. gender, age). Results showed a gender effect on human-likeness ratings. Thus, we computed a GLM analysis including gender as a covariate. A main effect of the time of movement was found. We conclude that humans rely more on temporal then on spatial information when evaluating properties (specifically, human-likeness) of biological motion of humanoid-shaped avatars.

AB  - The methods currently available for text entry on small mobile devices exhibit poor performance in terms of input speed, which presents a potential barrier to acceptance and growth. This paper presents an analysis of mobile text entry indicating that the likely solution is a combination of the use of language modelling and careful interaction design and verification. The paper argues that research in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is highly relevant to the mobile text entry problem and vice versa, and offers the opportunity to research solutions that will be feasible to implement on future generations of mobile devices. In the design of the system presented in this paper, fewer input buttons, natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal inputs are techniques that have been evaluated and applied. Contrary to initial expectations, analysis and evaluation showed that usability and human factors often are more significant factors in performance than the efficiency of the input method. In the conducted study, simplifications of a text-to-talk system increased productivity by 15%. This provides a strong indication that the best way to increase text production rates in realistic scenarios is to strive for simplicity and clarity in the interaction and user interface, rather than opting for including every possible time-saving feature in the system. Empirical validations of potential simplifications are therefore advocated as a general design methodology.

AB  - DoD investments into cyber threat defense are ongoing; however, little attention is paid to training personnel to detect and prevent threats to cyber networks that come from internal sources. Supervisors need to know what behavioral signs to watch for that might indicate an employee intends to commit an insider crime. Monitoring employee workstations is proving an ineffective means of determining insider threats. Training is needed to provide examples of the numerous ways cyber threats are achieved. An interactive role-play game environment may provide an appropriate instructional delivery system to train supervisors. Such a training system should employ instructional support features, aids, and feedback to the trainer and the trainee. The training system should also provide adaptive learning pathways to facilitate accelerated learning where individual assessments show mastery of specific content. Creating such a system not only requires appropriate training materials, but also a means to assess the systems efficacy. Augmented cognition methods and techniques for evaluating the cognitive state of a learner provide a real-time, objective means of evaluating training delivery and content. In this paper we discuss our efforts to assess learner engagement using psychophysiological measures.

AB  - This paper discusses the use of cognitive models as augmented metacognition on task allocation for tasks requiring visual attention. In the domain of naval warfare, the complex and dynamic nature of the environment makes that one has to deal with a large number of tasks in parallel. Therefore, humans are often supported by software agents that take over part of these tasks. However, a problem is how to determine an appropriate allocation of tasks. Due to the rapidly changing environment, such a work division cannot be fixed beforehand: dynamic task allocation at runtime is needed. Unfortunately, in alarming situations the human does not have the time for this coordination. Therefore system-triggered dynamic task allocation is desirable. The paper discusses the possibilities of such a system for tasks requiring visual attention.

AB  - Cognitive biometrics aims to user authentication (or identification) by direct measure of electrophysiological signals as response to specific stimuli. In the literature, authentication paradigms for network applications are intended for healthy and independent users with complete control of their muscles. This excludes people with severe motor impairment, such as Brain-computer interface (BCI) users. Conversely, BCIs permit communication with users even in extreme impairment conditions, such as those suffering from locked-in syndrome or in advanced stage of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The downside of BCIs is their very poor performance that, measured in terms of throughput and bit error rate, could lead to impracticable authentication. Specifically, current network applications require users to type long usernames and passwords formed with characters chosen from a large dataset. This forces long BCI sessions that users can not afford due to their heavy cognitive workload. In this paper we present some EEG-based authentication approaches and discuss some relevant aspects that a BCI-based authentication approach should consider for users with severe motor impairment.

AB  - While objects of our focus of attention (“where we are looking at”) and accompanying affective responses to those objects is part of our daily experience, little research exists on investigating the relation between attention and positive affective evaluation. The purpose of our research is to process users’ emotion and attention in real-time, with the goal of designing systems that may recognize a user’s affective response to a particular visually presented stimulus in the presence of other stimuli, and respond accordingly. In this paper, we introduce the AutoSelect system that automatically detects a user’s preference based on eye movement data and physiological signals in a two-alternative forced choice task. In an exploratory study involving the selection of neckties, the system could correctly classify subjects’ choice of in 81%. In this instance of AutoSelect, the gaze ‘cascade effect’ played a dominant role, whereas pupil size could not be shown as a reliable predictor of preference.

AB  - Unintentional lapses of attention, or mind wandering, are ubiquitous and detrimental during learning. Hence, automated methods that detect and combat mind wandering might be beneficial to learning. As an initial step in this direction, we propose to detect mind wandering by monitoring physiological measures of skin conductance and skin temperature. We conducted a study in which student’s physiology signals were measured while they learned topics in research methods from instructional texts. Momentary self-reports of mind wandering were collected with standard probe-based methods. We computed features from the physiological signals in windows leading up to the probes and trained supervised classification models to detect mind wandering. We obtained a kappa, a measurement of accuracy corrected for random guessing, of .22, signaling feasibility of detecting MW in a student-independent manner. Though modest, we consider this result to be an important step towards fully-automated unobtrusive detection of mind wandering during learning.

Study 1 (N = 135 high-school students) tested the feasibility of COTS eye tracking while students learn biology with an intelligent tutoring system called GuruTutor in their classroom. We could successfully track eye gaze in 75% (both eyes tracked) and 95% (one eye tracked) of the cases for 85% of the sessions where gaze was successfully recorded. In Study 2, we used this data to build automated student-independent detectors of mind wandering, obtaining accuracies (mind wandering F1 = 0.59) substantially better than chance (F1 = 0.24). Study 3 investigated context-generalizability of mind wandering detectors, finding that models trained on data collected in a controlled laboratory more successfully generalized to the classroom than the reverse. Study 4 investigated gaze- and video- based mind wandering detection, finding that gaze-based detection was superior and multimodal detection yielded an improvement in limited circumstances. We tested live mind wandering detection on a new sample of 39 students in Study 5 and found that detection accuracy (mind wandering F1 = 0.40) was considerably above chance (F1 = 0.24), albeit lower than offline detection accuracy from Study 1 (F1 = 0.59), a finding attributable to handling of missing data. We discuss our next steps towards developing gaze-based attention-aware learning technologies to increase engagement and learning by combating mind wandering in classroom contexts.

AB  - Mobile eye tracking is beneficial for the analysis of human–machine interactions of tangible products, as it tracks the eye movements reliably in natural environments, and it allows for insights into human behaviour and the associated cognitive processes. However, current methods require a manual screening of the video footage, which is time-consuming and subjective. This work aims to automatically detect cognitive demanding phases in mobile eye tracking recordings. The approach presented combines the user’s perception (gaze) and action (hand) to isolate demanding interactions based upon a multi-modal feature level fusion. It was validated in a usability study of a 3D printer with 40 participants by comparing the usability problems found to a thorough manual analysis. The new approach detected 17 out of 19 problems, while the time for manual analyses was reduced by 63%. More than eye tracking alone, adding the information of the hand enriches the insights into human behaviour. The field of AI could significantly advance our approach by improving the hand-tracking through region proposal CNNs, by detecting the parts of a product and mapping the demanding interactions to these parts, or even by a fully automated end-to-end detection of demanding interactions via deep learning. This could set the basis for machines providing real-time assistance to the machine’s users in cases where they are struggling.

AB  - Computing environment is moving from computer centered designs to human-centered designs. Human’s tend to communicate wealth of information through affective states or expressions. Thus automatic analysis of user affective states have become inevitable for computer vision community. In this paper first we focus on understanding human visual system (HVS) when it decodes or recognizes facial expressions. To understand HVS, we have conducted psycho-visual experimental study with an eye-tracker, to find which facial region is perceptually more attractive or salient for a particular expression. Secondly, based on results obtained from psycho-visual experimental study we have proposed a novel framework for automatic analysis of affective states. Framework creates discriminative feature space by processing only salient facial regions to extract Pyramid Histogram of Orientation Gradients (PHOG) features. The proposed framework achieved automatic expression recognition accuracy of 95.3 % on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression database for six universal facial expressions. We have also discussed generalization capabilites of proposed framework on unseen data. In the last paper discusses effectiveness of proposed framework against low resolution image sequences.

AB  - Eye-tracking technology is becoming easier and cheaper to use, resulting in its increasing application to numerous fields of research. Recent years have seen rapid developments in this area. In light of the foregoing, in the context of Cultural Heritage (CH), the definition of a modern approach to understand how individuals perceive art is challenging. Despite the art perception is highly subjective and variable according to knowledge and experience, more recently, several scientific study and enterprises started to quantify how subjects observe art by the application of the eye-tracking technology. The aim of this study was to understand the visual behaviour of subjects looking at paintings, using eye-tracking technology, in order to define a protocol for optimizing an existing Augmented Reality (AR) application that allows the visualization of digital contents through a display. The stimuli used are three famous paintings preserved at the National Gallery of Marche (Urbino, Marche Region, Italy). We applied eye-tracking to have a deeper understanding of people visual activities in front of these paintings and to analyse how digital contents eventually influence their behaviour. The description of the applied procedure and the preliminary results are presented.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder quite wide and its numerous variations render diagnosis hard. Some works have proven that children suffering from autism have trouble keeping their attention and tend to have a less focused sight. On top of that, eye-tracking systems enable the recording of precise eye focus on a screen. This paper deals with automatic detection of autism spectrum disorder thanks to eye-tracked data and an original Machine Learning approach. Focusing on data that describes the saccades of the patient’s sight, we distinguish, out of our six test patients, young autistic individuals from those with no problems in 83% (five) of tested patients, with a results confidence up to 95%.

AB  - Mind wandering (MW) is a ubiquitous phenomenon where attention involuntarily shifts from task-related processing to task-unrelated thoughts. There is a need for adaptive systems that can reorient attention when MW is detected due to its detrimental effects on performance and productivity. This paper proposes an automated gaze-based detector of self-caught MW (i.e., when users become consciously aware that they are MW). Eye gaze data and self-reports of MW were collected as 178 users read four instructional texts from a computer interface. Supervised machine learning models trained on features extracted from users’ gaze fixations were used to detect pages where users caught themselves MW. The best performing model achieved a user-independent kappa of .45 (accuracy of 74% compared to a chance accuracy of 52%); the first ever demonstration of a self-caught MW detector. An analysis of the features revealed that during MW, users made more regression fixations, had longer saccades that crossed lines more often, and had more uniform fixation durations, indicating a violation from normal reading patterns. Applications of the MW detector are discussed.

AB  - Joint attention is an early-developing social-communicative skill in which two people (usually a young child and an adult) share attention with regards to an interesting object or event, by means of gestures and gaze, and its presence is a key element in evaluating the therapy in the case of autism spectrum disorders. In this work, a novel automatic system able to detect joint attention by using completely non-intrusive depth camera installed on the room ceiling is presented. In particular, in a scenario where a humanoid-robot, a therapist (or a parent) and a child are interacting, the system can detect the social interaction between them. Specifically, a depth camera mounted on the top of a room is employed to detect, first of all, the arising event to be monitored (performed by an humanoid robot) and, subsequently, to detect the eventual joint attention mechanism analyzing the orientation of the head. The system operates in real-time, providing to the therapist a completely non-intrusive instrument to help him to evaluate the quality and the precise modalities of this predominant feature during the therapy session.

AB  - Mind wandering is a ubiquitous phenomenon where attention involuntarily shifts from task-related thoughts to internal task-unrelated thoughts. Mind wandering can have negative effects on performance; hence, intelligent interfaces that detect mind wandering can improve performance by intervening and restoring attention to the current task. We investigated the use of eye gaze and contextual cues to automatically detect mind wandering during reading with a computer interface. Participants were pseudorandomly probed to report mind wandering while an eye tracker recorded their gaze during the reading task. Supervised machine learning techniques detected positive responses to mind wandering probes from eye gaze and context features in a user-independent fashion. Mind wandering was detected with an accuracy of 72 % (expected accuracy by chance was 60 %) when probed at the end of a page and an accuracy of 67 % (chance was 59 %) when probed in the midst of reading a page. Global gaze features (gaze patterns independent of content, such as fixation durations) were more effective than content-specific local gaze features. An analysis of the features revealed diagnostic patterns of eye gaze behavior during mind wandering: (1) certain types of fixations were longer; (2) reading times were longer than expected; (3) more words were skipped; and (4) there was a larger variability in pupil diameter. Finally, the automatically detected mind wandering rate correlated negatively with measures of learning and transfer even after controlling for prior knowledge, thereby providing evidence of predictive validity. Possible improvements to the detector and applications that utilize the detector are discussed.

VL  - 28

AB  - An artist usually does not draw all the areas in a picture homogeneously but tries to make the work more expressive by emphasizing what is important while eliminating irrelevant details. Creating expressive painterly images with such accentuation effect remains to be a challenge because of the subjectivity of information selection. This paper presents a novel technique for automatically converting an input image into a pencil drawing with such emphasis and elimination effect. The proposed technique utilizes saliency map, a computational model for visual attention, to predict the focus of attention in the input image. A new level of detail controlling algorithm using multi-resolution pyramid is also developed for locally adapting the rendering parameters, such as the density, orientation and width of pencil strokes, to the degree of attention defined by saliency map. Experimental results show that the images generated with the proposed method present the visual effect similar to that of the real pencil drawing and can successfully direct the viewer’s attention toward the focus.

AB  - In addition to verbal behavior, nonverbal behavior is an important aspect for an embodied dialogue system to be able to conduct a smooth conversation with the user. Researchers have focused on automatically generating nonverbal behavior from speech and language information of dialogue systems. We propose a model to generate head nods accompanying an utterance from natural language. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies generated nods from the final words at the end of an utterance, i.e. bag of words. In this study, we focused on various text analyzed using linguistic information such as dialog act, part of speech, a large-scale Japanese thesaurus, and word position in a sentence. First, we compiled a Japanese corpus of 24 dialogues including utterance and nod information. Next, using the corpus, we created a model that generates nod during a phrase by using dialog act, part of speech, a large-scale Japanese thesaurus, word position in a sentence in addition to bag of words. The results indicate that our model outperformed a model using only bag of words and chance level. The results indicate that dialog act, part of speech, the large-scale Japanese thesaurus, and word position are useful to generate nods. Moreover, the model using all types of linguistic information had the highest performance. This result indicates that several types of linguistic information have the potential to be strong predictors with which to generate nods automatically.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Automated systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in our environment. This leads to a new tasks repartition between the human operator and automation. Understanding human-machine cooperation including potential failures has become a hot topic. In this study we focus on a possible negative consequence of automation: the complacency phenomenon. This phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in dynamic situations in which automation execute an action in order to relieve the human operator from his/her activity. In static task, automation often serves to simplify/pre-process the data and not to directly make a decision. The goal of automation in a static task (like planning) is to optimize an external representation and allow the human operator to make his choices more easily. The Eye Tracker is used to understand human behaviors and their strategies in these static situations. The purpose of this study is therefore to compare complacency to “action execution” from complacency to “data simplification”. We confronted 96 participants to these two automation types on the Multi Attribute Task Battery. We also manipulated four levels of automation reliability (0%; 56.25%; 87.5%, 100%). In all these conditions we assessed complacency through the detection rate of automation failure. In addition, we used an eye tracker to assess a potential low level of suspicion regarding automation failure.

AB  - Game-based learning environments (GBLEs) are being increasingly utilized in education and training to enhance and encourage engagement and learning. This study investigated how students, who were afforded varying levels of autonomy, interacted with two types of informational text presentations (e.g., non-player character (NPC) instances, traditional informational text) while problem solving with Crystal Island (CI), a GBLE, and their effect on overall learning by examining eye-tracking and performance data. Ninety undergraduate students were randomly assigned to two conditions, full and partial agency, which varied in the amount of autonomy students were granted to explore CI and interactive game elements (i.e., reading informational text, scanning food items). Within CI, informational text is presented in a traditional format, where there are large chunks of text presented at a single time represented as books and research articles, as well as in the form of participant conversation with NPCs throughout the environment. Results indicated significantly greater proportional learning gain (PLG) for participants in the partial agency condition than in the full agency condition. Additionally, longer participant fixations on traditionally presented informational text positively predicted participant PLG. Fixation durations were significantly longer in the partial agency condition than the full agency condition. However, the combination of visual and verbal text represented by NPCs were not significant predictors of PLGs and do not differ across conditions.

High risks for patient’s health come with operating errors [33] so that the presented research project, called Professional UX, identifies signals and irritations caused by the interaction with a certain device by analyzing mimic, voice and eye tracking data during user experience tests. Besides, this paper will provide information on typical errors of interactive applications which are based on an empirical lab-based survey and the evaluated results achieved. The pictured proceeding of user experience tests and the following analysis can also be applied to other fields and serves as a support for the optimization of products and systems.

AB  - The ability to feel, adapt, reason, remember and communicate makes human a social being. Disabilities limit opportunities and capabilities to socialize. With the recent advancement in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, researchers are exploring if BCI can be augmented with human computer interaction (HCI) to give a new hope of restoring independence to disabled individuals. This motivates us to lay down our research objective, which is as follows. In this study, we propose to work with a hands-free text entry application based on the brain signals, for the task of communication, where the user can select a letter or word based on the intentions of left or right hand movement. The two major challenges that have been addressed are (i) interacting with only two imagery signals (ii) how a low-quality, noisy EEG signal can be competently processed and classified using novel combination of feature set to make the interface work efficiently. The results of five able-bodied users show that the error rate per minute is significantly reduced and it also illustrates that it can be further used to develop better BCI augmented HCI systems.

AB  - Due to an extensive list of restraints, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has seen limited success outside of laboratory conditions. In order to address these limitations, which have prevented widespread deployment, an existing modular architecture has been adapted to support hybrid collaboration of commercially available BCI and eye tracking technologies. However, combining multiple input modalities, which have different temporal properties, presents a challenge in terms of data fusion and collaboration at the user interface. The use of cost-effective and readily available equipment will further promote hybrid BCI as a viable but alternative interface for human computer interaction. In this paper, we focus on navigation through a virtual smart home and control of devices within the rooms; the navigation being controlled by multimodal interaction. As such, it promises a better information transfer rate than BCI alone. Consequently, an extended architecture for a personalised hybrid BCI system has been proposed.

AB  - Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is an emerging research area which has been studied over thirty years extensively in the fields of clinical neurophysiology and neuroscience however it is now recognized as an interdisciplinary field involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics and computer science. HCI community has begun to deal with BCI and substantial publications have been made in HCI related journals and conferences in recent years. In the scope of this research we conducted a systematic mapping study with the articles published in proceedings of HCI International Conferences to reveal the trends, general aims of the articles, which signal recording modality were used, for what kind of practical applications were developed, which feature types and classification algorithms were used and what are the nationalities and institutes of contributing authors in the scope of HCI International conference. The aim was to give insight to the researchers who were studying or would like to study in the area of BCI. According to the results of the mapping, research type of BCI articles were mainly in the category of emerging applications not related to communication and control. General aim of the articles was determined as practical applications of BCI technologies first and then development or improvement of methodologies for signal processing issues. Visual P300 was the mostly applied BCI paradigms and SSVEP and motor imagery followed next. Most of the articles had reported EEG as a signal acquisition method, ICA or bandpass filter as a preprocessing or filtering method, ERP as a feature type and LDA and LR as a classification algorithm method.

Student modeling, i.e., the process of having an ITS build a model of relevant student’s traits/states during interaction, is a task permeated with uncertainty, which naturally calls for probabilistic approaches. In this chapter, I will describe techniques and issues involved in building probabilistic student models based on Bayesian networks and their extensions. I will describe pros and cons of this approach, and discuss examples from existing Intelligent Tutoring Systems that rely on Bayesian student models

It is, however, untrue in reality; a person usually walks differently according to their mood and physical/mental conditions, which we call “inertial states.” Motivated by this fact, we organized the research project “Behavior Understanding based on Intention-Gait Model”, which was supported by JST-CREST from 2010 to 2017. The goal of this project was to map “gait”, in the broad sense of the term, to inertial states such as attention, social factors, and cognitive ability. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the three kinds of estimation technologies considered in this project: attention, social factors, and cognitive ability.

AB  - This chapter examines what are described as user behavioral characteristics. These are characteristics that are related to perception in broad terms. The chapter starts by defining some behavioral terms and concepts that are used in this and subsequent chapters. We then describe in detail several aspects of the two main perceptual systems that are involved in interacting with computer-based systems: vision and hearing. For each of these aspects we consider some of the implications they have for system design. We finish by introducing the topic of motivation to help explain why individual users may behave in a particular way when carrying out a task.

AB  - One of the important characteristics of behavioral animation is its ability to reduce the workload on the animators. This is achieved by letting a behavioral model automatically take care of the low-level details of the animation, freeing the animator to concentrate on the big picture. Freeing the animator from low-level animation details is even more important when dealing with crowds. An animator manually creating a crowd animation is overwhelmed not only by the large number of animated entities, but also by the interactions between them.

AB  - By borrowing the wisdom of human in gaze following, we propose a two-stage solution for gaze point prediction of the target persons in a scene. Specifically, in the first stage, both head image and its position are fed into a gaze direction pathway to predict the gaze direction, and then multi-scale gaze direction fields are generated to characterize the distribution of gaze points without considering the scene contents. In the second stage, the multi-scale gaze direction fields are concatenated with the image contents and fed into a heatmap pathway for heatmap regression. There are two merits for our two-stage solution based gaze following: (i) our solution mimics the behavior of human in gaze following, therefore it is more psychological plausible; (ii) besides using heatmap to supervise the output of our network, we can also leverage gaze direction to facilitate the training of gaze direction pathway, therefore our network can be more robustly trained. Considering that existing gaze following dataset is annotated by the third-view persons, we build a video gaze following dataset, where the ground truth is annotated by the observers in the videos. Therefore it is more reliable. The evaluation with such a dataset reflects the capacity of different methods in real scenarios better. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, which validates the effectiveness of our solution for gaze following. Our dataset and codes are released in https://github.com/svip-lab/GazeFollowing.

AB  - Providing image annotations is a tedious task. This becomes even more cumbersome when objects shall be annotated in the images. Such region-based annotations can be used in various ways like similarity search or as training set in automatic object detection. We investigate the principle idea of finding objects in images by looking at gaze paths from users, viewing images with an interest in a specific object. We have analyzed 799 gaze paths from 30 subjects viewing image-tag-pairs with the task to decide whether a tag could be found in the image or not. We have compared 13 different fixation measures analyzing the gaze paths. The best performing fixation measure is able to correctly assign a tag to a region for 63 % of the image-tag-pairs and significantly outperforms three baselines. We look into details of the image region characteristics such as the position and size for incorrect and correct assignments. The influence of aggregating multiple gaze paths from several subjects with respect to improving the precision of identifying the correct regions is also investigated. In addition, we look into the possibilities of discriminating different regions in the same image. Here, we are able to correctly identify two regions in the same image from different primings with an accuracy of 38 %.

AB  - It is widely accepted that spatial representation is processed by an amodal system. Recent studies show that blind subjects have a better motion ability than sighted people in performing spatial exploration guided only by auditory cues. The sonification method offers an effective tool able to transmit graphic information, overcoming the digital divide risen by a visuocentric modality in which contents are conveyed. We present a usability evaluation aiming at investigate the interaction differences between both blind and sighted users while surfing WhatsOnWeb, a search engine that displays the information by using graph-drawing methods on semantically clustered data. We compare the visual presentation of three different layouts with the sonificated ones, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that blind and sighted users perform with no significant differences the interaction. These results remark that the digital divide could be decreased by going beyond the visuocentric way of the commonly adopted visual content representation.

AB  - The article shows where the argument of responsibility-gap regarding brain-computer interfaces acquires its plausibility from, and suggests why the argument is not plausible. As a way of an explanation, a distinction between the descriptive third-person perspective and the interpretative first-person perspective is introduced. Several examples and metaphors are used to show that ascription of agency and responsibility does not, even in simple cases, require that people be in causal control of every individual detail involved in an event. Taking up the current debate on liability in BCI use, the article provides and discusses some rules that should be followed when potentially harmful BCI-based devices are brought from the laboratory into everyday life.

JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
SP  - 377

VL  - 20
IS  - 3
AB  - Cyclists’ use of mobile phones in traffic has typically been studied in controlled experiments. How cyclists adapt their behaviour when they are not limited to a certain set of behaviours has not been investigated to any large extent. The aims of this study are to explore how cyclists adapt when texting and listening to music in a complex urban environment, and if they compensate sufficiently to maintain safe traffic behaviour. Forty-one cyclists participated in a semi-controlled study, using their own bike and smartphone in real traffic. They were equipped with eye tracking glasses and travelled two laps completing a total of 6 km divided into six segments. For one of the laps, the cyclists were requested to listen to music. On three occasions, they received a text message to their phone, which they were supposed to handle as they normally would when cycling. Static minimum required attention measures were used to examine the influence on attention. The results show that listening to music while cycling did not affect workload, speed, SMS interaction or attention. Seven different adaptation behaviours were identified when the cyclists dealt with received text messages. One-fourth of the text messages were replied to while cycling. In general, the cyclists manage to integrate SMS interactions with their cycling behaviour. Nevertheless, there were two occasions when basic attention criteria were violated while texting, which motivate further studies.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Simulation based training is one way to attain operational realism for training complex military tasks in a safe, task relevant manner. For successful transfer of knowledge, skills, and abilities to the dynamically changing military environment, the human-computer interface should minimally support learning during the training process and provide congruent action plans that facilitate understanding of the overall training goal. While there are emerging controller technologies, simulators still rely on such input devices as mouse and keyboard. These devices potentially cause information and training bottlenecks as they limit naturalistic interactivity within the more advanced serious gaming platforms. Given the shortcomings of current interface design, we suggest a human-computer interface framework that includes perceptual user interface components and an open source serious game testbed. We discuss a multimodal framework called bio-reckoning that integrates brain-computer interface techniques, eye tracking, and facial recognition within EDGE, the U.S. Army’s newest serious game based training tool.

As a result of the amazing success of genomics projects like the Human Genome Project and the recent interest in the field of proteomics, the biological sciences have been amassing tremendous amounts of data. The enormity of this data, being much too large to analyze by hand, has given rise to a union between biological sciences and computer-based data analysis, which in turn has led to the birth of the field of bioinformatics.

AB  - Business Intelligence & Analytics’ dashboards, data visualizations, and visual analysis systems are cognitive tools that heavily rely on our understanding of subconscious-level processing, human perception and cognitive processes overall. These cognitive tools are the focal point of data visualization subfield called Business Information Visualization (BIV). While the BIV field has seen calls for an increased need of deploying physiological sensing techniques and the use of biometric data, these calls have yet to translate to a more comprehensive evaluation of human response to visual displays and systems using business data. This research identifies and describes biometric sensors researchers should consider in BIV, provides a brief review of literature at the nexus of data visualization and biometrics, and identifies a biometric data-based research agenda and opportunities for BIV.

AB  - Intelligence analysts are bombarded with enormous volumes of imagery that they must visually filter to identify relevant areas of interest. Interpretation of such data is subject to error due to (1) large data volumes, implying the need for faster and more effective processing, and (2) misinterpretation, implying the need for enhanced analyst/system effectiveness. This paper outlines the Revolutionary Accelerated Processing Image Detection (RAPID) System, designed to significantly improve data throughput and interpretation by incorporating advancing neurophysiological technology to monitor processes associated with detection and identification of relevant target stimuli in a non-invasive and temporally precise manner. Specifically, this work includes the development of innovative electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye tracking technologies to detect and flag areas of interest, potentially without an analyst’s conscious intervention or motor responses, while detecting and mitigating problems with tacit knowledge, such as anchoring bias in real-time to reduce the possibility of human error.

IS  - 1
AB  - The brain–computer interface (BCI) has made remarkable progress in the bridging the divide between the brain and the external environment to assist persons with severe disabilities caused by brain impairments. There is also continuing philosophical interest in BCIs which emerges from thoughtful reflection on computers, machines, and artificial intelligence. This article seeks to apply BCI perspectives to examine, challenge, and work towards a possible resolution to a persistent problem in the mind–body relationship, namely dualism. The original humanitarian goals of BCIs and the technological inventiveness result in BCIs being surprisingly useful. We begin from the neurologically impaired person, the problems encountered, and some pioneering responses from computers and machines. Secondly, the interface of mind and brain is explored via two points of clarification: direct and indirect BCIs, and the nature of thoughts. Thirdly, dualism is beset by mind–body interaction difficulties and is further questioned by the phenomena of intentions, interactions, and technology. Fourthly, animal minds and robots are explored in BCI settings again with relevance for dualism. After a brief look at other BCIs, we conclude by outlining a future BCI philosophy of brain and mind, which might appear ominous and could be possible.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The black box nature of the recommendation systems limits the understanding and acceptance of the recommendation received by the user. In contrast, user interaction and information visualization play a key role in addressing these drawbacks. In the brokerage domain, insurance brokers offer, negotiate and sell insurance products for their customers. Support brokers into the recommendation process can improve the loyalty, profit, and marketing campaign in their client portfolio. This work presents Broker-Insights, an interactive and visualisation-based insurance products recommender system to support brokers into the decision-making (recommendation) at two levels: recommendations for a specific potential customer; and recommendations for a group of customers. Looking for offering personalized recommendations, Broker-Insights provides a tool to manage customers information in the recommendation task and a module to perform customers segmentation based on specific characteristics. With the help of an eye-tracker, we evaluated Broker-Insigths usability with ten naive users on the offline fashion and also performed an evaluation in the wild with three insurance brokers. Results achieved show that data mining methods, while combined with interactive data visualization improved the user experience and decision-making process into the recommendation task, and increased the products recommendation acceptance.

AB  - A multimodal system is a system equipped with a multimodal interface through which a user can interact with the system by using his/her natural communication modalities, such as speech, gesture, eye gaze, etc. To understand a user’s intension, multimodal input fusion, a critical component of a multimodal interface, integrates a user’s multimodal inputs and finds the combined semantic interpretation of them. As powerful, yet affordable input and output technologies becoming available, such as speech recognition and eye tracking, it becomes possible to attach recognition technologies to existing applications with a multimodal input fusion module; therefore, a practical multimodal system can be built. This paper documents our experience about building a practical multimodal system with our multimodal input fusion technology. The pilot study has been conducted over the multimodal system. By outlining observations from the pilot study, the implications on multimodal interface design are laid out.

AB  - This paper introduces the SHARE-IT project, which leverages serious games paradigm to motivate and engage children with autism diagnosis in interactive activities, based on the state-of-the-art autism intervention practices. The aim of SHARE-IT is to formulate, in partnership with schools, parents and industry, the requirements for a robust, intelligent and authorable environment for supporting children in exploring, practicing and acquiring social interaction skills. SHARE-IT focuses on two key challenges: (i) developing robust system architecture and implementation, able to support both continuing development of a serious game for children with autism and its real world use; and (ii) selecting appropriate technologies and techniques to allow for (a) multi-device and operating system deployment, (b) the development of an intelligent serious game for supporting social interaction while (c) allowing the flexibility for the environment to be authored by lay persons. SHARE-IT’s architecture is presented and several considerations of importance to enabling the engineering of an intelligent and authorable serious game are discussed. Examples of technologies developed to date are given throughout and a discussion of future challenges offered.

VL  - 22
IS  - 2
AB  - Many future decision support systems will be human-centric, i.e., require substantial human oversight and control. Because these systems often provide critical services, high assurance is needed that they satisfy their requirements. This paper, the product of an interdisciplinary research team of experts in formal methods, adaptive agents, and cognitive science, addresses this problem by proposing a new process for developing high assurance human-centric decision systems. This process uses AI (artificial intelligence) methods—i.e., a cognitive model to predict human behavior and an adaptive agent to assist the human—to improve system performance, and software engineering methods—i.e., formal modeling and analysis—to obtain high assurance that the system behaves as intended. The paper describes a new method for synthesizing a formal system model from Event Sequence Charts, a variant of Message Sequence Charts, and a Mode Diagram, a specification of system modes and mode transitions. It also presents results of a new pilot study investigating the optimal level of agent assistance for different users in which the agent design was evaluated using synthesized user models. Finally, it reviews a cognitive model for predicting human overload in complex human-centric systems. To illustrate the development process and our new techniques, we describe a human-centric decision system for controlling unmanned vehicles.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach for feature extraction based on symbolic hierarchical graphs. We will focus on the construction model, which uses simple rules considering both the graph’s structure and the symbols stored in each node. We will also consider some trends to dynamically modify those rules in order to implement a learning process or to be able to adapt the rules to one given problem or to the input image.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Successful self-regulated learning in a personalized learning environment (PLE) requires self-monitoring of the learner and reflection of learning behaviour. We introduce a tool called CAMera for monitoring and reporting on learning behaviour and thus for supporting learning reflection. The tool collects usage metadata from diverse application programs, stores these metadata as Contextualized Attention Metadata (CAM) and makes them accessible to the learner for recapitulating her learning activities. Usage metadata can be captured both locally on the user’s computer and remotely from a server. We introduce two ways of exploiting CAM, namely the analysis of email-messages stored locally on a user’s computer and the derivation of patterns and trends in the usage of the MACE system for architectural learning.

VL  - 19

AB  - This paper presents the COWORK2 method, designed to classify the collective tasks of a fighter jet patrol according to two classification criteria: mental workload (at individual level) and communication quality (at team level). The classification purpose is to detect the tasks for which collective work could be impaired. A three-stage method is developed. Stage 1 consists in carrying out a task analysis with a subject matter expert to identify the collective tasks and characterize them in terms of commonly occurring situations and functions (constraints). In Stage 2, data related to individual mental workload (physiological measures) and team communications (communication recordings) are collected from a low-intrusiveness device in a highly realistic simulation environment. Stage 3 finally produces the classification of patrol collective tasks according to the two levels of analysis: individual and team. This classification is corroborated by the risk-level categorization of collective tasks achieved by a subject matter expert. The results highlight the relevance of the COWORK2 method.

IS  - 3
AB  - As modern assistive technology advances, eye-based text entry systems have been developed to help a subset of physically challenged people to improve their communication ability. However, speed of text entry in early eye-typing system tends to be relatively slow due to dwell time. Recently, dwell-free methods have been proposed which outperform the dwell-based systems in terms of speed and resilience, but the extra eye-tracking device is still an indispensable equipment. In this article, we propose a prototype of eye-typing system using an off-the-shelf webcam without the extra eye tracker, in which the appearance-based method is proposed to estimate people’s gaze coordinates on the screen based on the frontal face images captured by the webcam. We also investigate some critical issues of the appearance-based method, which helps to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce computing complexity in practice. The performance evaluation shows that eye typing with webcam using the proposed method is comparable to the eye tracker under a small degree of head movement.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We developed Camera Canvas, photo editing and picture drawing software for individuals who cannot use their hands to operate a computer mouse. Camera Canvas is designed for use with camera-based mouse-replacement interfaces that allow a user with severe motion impairments to control the mouse pointer by moving his or her head in front of a web camera. To make Camera Canvas accessible to as wide of a range of movement abilities as possible, we designed its user interface so that it can be extensively tailored to meet individual user needs. We conducted studies with users without disabilities, who used Camera Canvas with the mouse-replacement input system Camera Mouse. The studies showed that Camera Canvas is easy to understand and use, even for participants without prior experience with the Camera Mouse. An experiment with a participant with severe cerebral palsy and quadriplegia showed that he was able to use some but not all of the functionality of Camera Canvas. Ongoing work includes conducting additional user studies and improving the software based on feedback.

AB  - We are motivated to make the interaction between a computer and people with disabilities better with more flexible interactions in their activities. Camera Canvas, the existing photo drawing and editing desktop software for motor-impaired individuals to operate a computer mouse, has been integrated well in the mouse-replacement interface, Camera Mouse. Therefore, our approach is to optimize Camera Canvas for the sake of helping gain a better experience in tailoring local photos/images. With more image filtering designed in computer vision techniques, Camera Canvas enhances better user experience. We conducted user studies with a few users without disabilities, who didn’t operate or operated Camera Canvas with Camera Mouse. We have initiated features of social media sharing in the software, and evaluation of social media integration is planned for future work. Our ongoing work includes conducting additional user studies and optimizing the software based on feedback or survey.

BT  - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics: Performance, Emotion and Situation Awareness
SP  - 76
EP  - 84
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Increased mental workload is often associated with increased risk of pilots’ operational errors. Mental workload is a multifactor problem. The paper aims at defining an appropriate indicator for pilot mental workload, under the assumption that vision is the single most important source of information for the pilot. We design a series of experiments about the task difficulty, which have different visibility, taxiing length and turns. The results showed that the fixation frequency did not increase with the task difficulty. Fixation frequency is not sensitive with the mental workload. This study concludes that the Fixation frequency cannot be used as the evaluation criteria of mental workload. But the results may be caused by small sample sizes (three pilots).

VL  - 29
IS  - 3
AB  - We explore the question of whether machines can infer information about our psychological traits or mental states by observing samples of our behaviour gathered from our online activities. Ongoing technical advances across a range of research communities indicate that machines are now able to access this information, but the extent to which this is possible and the consequent implications have not been well explored. We begin by highlighting the urgency of asking this question, and then explore its conceptual underpinnings, in order to help emphasise the relevant issues. To answer the question, we review a large number of empirical studies, in which samples of behaviour are used to automatically infer a range of psychological constructs, including affect and emotions, aptitudes and skills, attitudes and orientations (e.g. values and sexual orientation), personality, and disorders and conditions (e.g. depression and addiction). We also present a general perspective that can bring these disparate studies together and allow us to think clearly about their philosophical and ethical implications, such as issues related to consent, privacy, and the use of persuasive technologies for controlling human behaviour.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The salient regions of interest are supposed to contain the interesting keypoints for analysis and understanding. We studied in this paper the impact of image reduction to the region of interest on the emotion recognition. We chose a bottom-up visual attention model because we addressed emotions on a new low-semantic data set SENSE (Studies of Emotion on Natural image databaSE). We organized two experimentations. The first one has been conducted on the whole images called SENSE1 and the second on reduced images named SENSE2. These latter are obtained with a visual attention model and their size varies from 3% to 100% of the size of the original ones. The information collected during these evaluations are the nature and the power of emotions. For the nature observers have choice between ”Negative”, ”Neutral” and ”Positive” and the power varies from ”Weak” to ”Strong”. On the both experimentations some images have ambiguous categorization. In fact, the participants were not able to decide on their emotional class (Negative, Neutral ans Positive). The evaluations on reduced images showed that average 79% of the uncategorised images during SENSE1 are categorized during SENSE2 in one of the both major classes. Reducing the size of the area to be observed leads to a better evaluation maybe because some semantic content are attenuated.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Eye tracking information can be used to assign given tags to image regions in order to describe the depicted scene in more details. We introduce and compare two novel eye-tracking-based measures for conducting such assignments: The segmentation measure uses automatically computed image segments and selects the one segment the user fixates for the longest time. The heat map measure is based on traditional gaze heat maps and sums up the users’ fixation durations per pixel. Both measures are applied on gaze data obtained for a set of social media images, which have manually labeled objects as ground truth. We have determined a maximum average precision of 65% at which the segmentation measure points to the correct region in the image. The best coverage of the segments is obtained for the segmentation measure with a F-measure of 35%. Overall, both newly introduced gaze-based measures deliver better results than baseline measures that selects a segment based on the golden ratio of photography or the center position in the image. The eye-tracking-based segmentation measure significantly outperforms the baselines for precision and F-measure.

TI  - Can autism be catered with artificial intelligence-assisted intervention technology? A comprehensive survey
JO  - Artificial Intelligence Review
AB  - This article presents an extensive literature review of technology based intervention methodologies for individuals facing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reviewed methodologies include: contemporary computer aided systems, computer vision assisted technologies and virtual reality (VR) or artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interventions. The research over the past decade has provided enough demonstrations that individuals with ASD have a strong interest in technology based interventions, which are useful in both, clinical settings as well as at home and classrooms. Despite showing great promise, research in developing an advanced technology based intervention that is clinically quantitative for ASD is minimal. Moreover, the clinicians are generally not convinced about the potential of the technology based interventions due to non-empirical nature of published results. A major reason behind this lack of acceptability is that a vast majority of studies on distinct intervention methodologies do not follow any specific standard or research design. We conclude from our findings that there remains a gap between the research community of computer science, psychology and neuroscience to develop an AI assisted intervention technology for individuals suffering from ASD. Following the development of a standardized AI based intervention technology, a database needs to be developed, to devise effective AI algorithms.

SP  - 307

VL  - 19
IS  - 4
AB  - We study a new research problem, where an implicit information retrieval query is inferred from eye movements measured when the user is reading, and used to retrieve new documents. In the training phase, the user’s interest is known, and we learn a mapping from how the user looks at a term to the role of the term in the implicit query. Assuming the mapping is universal, that is, the same for all queries in a given domain, we can use it to construct queries even for new topics for which no learning data is available. We constructed a controlled experimental setting to show that when the system has no prior information as to what the user is searching, the eye movements help significantly in the search. This is the case in a proactive search, for instance, where the system monitors the reading behaviour of the user in a new topic. In contrast, during a search or reading session where the set of inspected documents is biased towards being relevant, a stronger strategy is to search for content-wise similar documents than to use the eye movements.

AB  - Many recently developed information visualization techniques are radial variants of originally Cartesian visualizations. Almost none of these radial variants have been evaluated with respect to their benefits over their original visualizations. In this work we compare a radial and a Cartesian variant of a visualization tool for sequences of transactions in information hierarchies. The Timeline Trees (TLT) approach uses a Cartesian coordinate system to represent both the hierarchy and the sequence of transactions whereas the TimeRadarTrees (TRT) technique is the radial counterpart which makes use of a radial tree, as well as circle slices and sectors to show the sequence of transactions. For the evaluation we use both quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation methods including eye tracking.

AB  - Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for U.S. teens, accounting for more than one in three deaths in this age group and claiming the lives of about eight teenagers a day, according to the 2010 report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In order to inform new training methods and new technology to accelerate learning and reduce teen crash risk, a more complete understanding of this complex driving behavior was needed. In this application paper we present our first step towards deploying case-based techniques to model teenage driver behavior and skill level. Specifically, we present our results in using case-based reasoning (CBR) to model both the vehicle control behavior and the skill proficiency of teen drivers by using data collected in a high-fidelity driving simulator. In particular, we present a new similarity measure to compare behavioral data based on feature selection methods, which achieved good results in predicting behavior and skill.

AB  - Although eye tracking has been used to analyze user interfaces, the technology poses numerous challenges when applied to environments in which people move, work, and interact. Aren’t eye trackers limited to studying two-dimensional planes? How might the device help to understand activities that are not exclusively visual? These questions are integral to ethnography, the observational study of peoples’ interactions with products, processes, and places. We offer answers by way of two bodies of research. The first was conducted to optimize Instructions for Use (IFUs) for medical devices. The second was an exploratory study conducted to adapt eye trackers to manual tasks. The objective was to cultivate interpretive methods for evaluating visual and non-visual perception in eye-tracking data (i.e., fixation duration, gaze plots, heat maps). We suggest that the latter body of research illuminates new opportunities for ethnographic fieldwork to examine how medical professionals move their bodies when simultaneously carrying out procedures and viewing visual systems.

Furthermore, advances in hardware and software technology are moving interactive systems into 3D and virtual reality, and distributed real-time interaction such as computer-mediated conferencing and tele-operation. These demands and innovations will provide the incentive for the invention of novel pointing devices and the improvement of existing ones.

AB  - Sometimes a static object in video content is perceived to move. This motion illusion has been classified into two types: (1) induced motion and (2) motion capture. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how voluntary eye movements affect perceptions of induced motion and motion capture. By the results of a subjective assessment experiment, it is clarified that induced motion is inhibited by attention in both the horizontal and the vertical directions for reading textual information. It is also clarified that in contrast to induced motion, motion capture is not inhibited by attention. Specifically, motion capture is not inhibited by attention when viewers move their eyes in the same direction as the movement of the background.

AB  - This paper describes an e-learning interface with multiple tutoring character agents. The character agents use eye movement information to facilitate empathy-relevant reasoning and behavior. Eye Information is used to monitor user’s attention and interests, to personalize the agent behaviors, and for exchanging information of different learners. The system reacts to multiple users’ eye information in real-time and the empathic character agents owned by each learner exchange learner’s information to help to form the online learning community. Based on these measures, the interface infers the focus of attention of the learner and responds accordingly with affective and instructional behaviors. The paper will also report on some preliminary usability test results concerning how users respond to the empathic functions and interact with other learners using the character agents.

To do so, we assume that the text can be seen as texture, characters being the smallest texture elements, and we verify this hypothesis by a series of experiments over different sets of character images. We first apply a bank of 24 Gabor filters (4 frequencies and 6 orientations) on each set, then we extract texture features, that are used to classify character images without a priori knowledge using a Bayesian classifier. Results are shown for different characters written in a same font, and for different font types given a character.

BT  - Language, Music and Computing
SP  - 169
EP  - 182
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - We have analysed the basic characteristics of music playback at sight-reading of three two-line classic music selections of varying textures and complexity: a two-voice polyphonic musical piece, a theme and a variation of homophonic-harmonic musical piece. These characteristics serve as objective indicators of the musicians’ skill of sight-reading, and the complexity of musical selection. Applying an original technique of eye movement recording without fixating the head, we studied the eye-hand span i.e. the time from reading the text to music playback. Our findings reveal, that the eye-hand span depends on the texture of the performed musical piece and inversely correlates with the number of errors as well as directly correlates with the rate of stability in the performance. This parameter may serve as an objective measure of the sight-reading ability. It is connected with the complexity of a musical piece and, presumably, characterizes the working memory capacity of musicians.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we present a new method for printed text characterization. This method is based on a text visibility and legibility criterion. The text is analyzed through its typographic form. So, we propose to label different kinds of text according to their visual aspect and their textural contents (especially their size, their density but also the line and letter spacing). A scale of legibility and of structural relief of forms has realized this discrimination. The texture is characterized with a statistical analysis of density, which is impervious (insensitive) to our multiscale approach. This statistical analysis is at the basis of the text labeling. This work is a part of a complete scheme of physical and logical document segmentation. It is dedicated to the classification of texts according to their eye-catching properties.

AB  - We propose a graph-based analysis framework to study the dynamics of visual gaze from web users. Our goal is to extract the main characteristics of the information foraging process from an attention-centric perspective. Our approach consists of modeling web objects, such as images and paragraphs, as nodes. The visual transitions are represented as edges. With the resulting graphs, several standard metrics were computed. We performed an initial empirical study with 23 subjects. The visual activity was captured using an eye tracking device. The results suggest that a graph based analysis can capture in a reliable way the dynamics of user behavior and the identification of salient objects within a web site.

SP  - 3

PB  - Springer Singapore
CY  - Singapore
AB  - Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) represent a key part for building interactive applications, and they act as a direct interface between users and software. The complexity of the GUIs increases in relation to the number of users interacting with software and performing multiple complex tasks, resulting in software that are mazes of functionalities. The impact of such a GUI system is adverse on the software quality and may result in non-robust software. To measure software quality, one has to measure attributes such as usability, efficiency, and learnability. There is no general approach for measuring software validity subjectively in a non-invasive way, i.e., without directly asking the users to evaluate directly the software through predefined use cases or through questionnaires. In this paper, we investigate this issue by detecting the presence of potential errors in GUIs by using the users gaze information collected during user interactions. Users gaze is analyzed to generate thirteen unique features based on statistical moments based on the time spent on each control, gaze path, and transitions between controls on the different GUI components present on the screen. The performance is evaluated with five state of the art classifiers. The results support the conclusion that incongruent GUI states can be reliably detected at the single trial level through gaze-based features with an accuracy of 76% (one-versus-rest classification) and 73.66 (one-versus-one classification) using a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. These results suggest the possibility of co-development approaches between early stage users and developers through eyetracking.

AB  - E-learning systems based on a conversational agent (CA) provide the basis of an intuitive and engaging interface for the student. The goal of this paper is to propose a method for detecting conversational interaction behaviors of learners and CAs, using an agent-based framework, for the purpose of improving the communication between students and CA-based intelligent tutoring systems. Our framework models both the student and the CA and uses agents to represent data sources for each. We show how the framework uses the detection of conversational behaviors to initiate interventions to improve student conversational engagement. The results of initial user testing are reported.

AB  - Using plain, but large multi-layer perceptrons, temporal eye-tracking gaze patterns of alphabetic and logographic L1 readers were successfully classified. The Eye-tracking data was fed directly into the networks, with no need for pre-processing. Classification rates up to 92% were achieved using MLPs with 4 hidden units. By classifying the gaze patterns of interaction partners, artificial systems are able to act adaptively in a broad variety of application fields.

AB  - Being able to predict how internet users react when confronted with a potentially dangerous call for action in an online message (such as an e-mail) is important for several reasons. On the one hand, users have to be protected from fraudulent e-mails such as phishing. On the other hand, over-cautious users would be difficult to communicate with on the internet, so senders of legitimate messages have to know how to convince recipients of the authenticity of their messages. Extensive research already exists from both of these perspectives, but each study only explores certain aspects of the complex system of factors influencing users’ reactions. In this paper the results of our efforts to integrate the various existing findings into one comprehensive model are presented, along with the results of a preliminary evaluation of some of the model’s predictions using quantitative as well as qualitative measures and eye-tracking.

AB  - Gaze gestures bear potential for user input with mobile devices, especially smart glasses, due to being always available and hands-free. So far, gaze gesture recognition approaches have utilized open-eye movements only and disregarded closed-eye movements. This paper is a first investigation of the feasibility of detecting and recognizing closed-eye gaze gestures from close-up optical sources, e.g. eye-facing cameras embedded in smart glasses. We propose four different closed-eye gaze gesture protocols, which extend the alphabet of existing open-eye gaze gesture approaches. We further propose a methodology for detecting and extracting the corresponding closed-eye movements with full optical flow, time series processing, and machine learning. In the evaluation of the four protocols we find closed-eye gaze gestures to be detected 82.8%–91.6% of the time, and extracted gestures to be recognized correctly with an accuracy of 92.9%–99.2%.

AB  - Cognitive behaviour analysis is considered of high importance with many innovative applications in a range of sectors including healthcare, education, robotics and entertainment. In healthcare, cognitive and emotional behaviour analysis helps to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Amongst all the different approaches for cognitive behaviour analysis, significant work has been focused on emotion analysis through facial expressions using depth and EEG data. Our work introduces an emotion recognition approach using facial expressions based on depth data and landmarks. A novel dataset was created that triggers emotions from long or short term memories. This work uses novel features based on a non-linear dimensionality reduction, t-SNE, applied on facial landmarks and depth data. Its performance was evaluated in a comparative study, proving that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art features.

In this chapter we will motivate the reader to study cognitive ergonomics in visualization using an interdisciplinary approach. This interdisciplinary approach is based on eye tracking data visualization, ontology based visualization models, and cognitive simulations. Figure 1 shows the chapter structure, and the interdisciplinary approach we suggest.

AB  - An eye-tracking study examining the benefits of a proactive human-computer-interaction has been conducted. Regarding the beneficial aspects of knowledge transfer, the data shows a clear benefit once the system has been enhanced by the so called electronic educational instance which tracks a user’s gaze and thereby infers whether or not someone is actually looking at a screen while the e-learning software is conveying its knowledge. To further show how a physiological input might be used as a form of input, current literature of smoothing pupillary response data is discussed and a preliminary tool is presented. Due to this, pupillary data can be used to indicate cognitive load levels while learning and would therefore allow a proactive system to change the e-learning program accordingly.

TI  - Cognitive Load Measurement in Perspective
BT  - Robust Multimodal Cognitive Load Measurement
SP  - 251
EP  - 254
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Cognitive load is a significant factor in various application areas such as human-computer interaction (HCI), adaptive automation and training, traffic control, performance prediction, driving safety, and military command and control. Consequently, the investigation of cognitive load factors and cognitive load measurement is essential in order to improve human’s wellbeing and safety at work. As indicated in Part I, an individual human has limited cognitive resources. Both theories and models have been proposed to understand and measure cognitive load. Cognitive load theory models the interaction between limited working memory and the relatively unlimited long term memory during the learning process. It distinguishes between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load. The first type is associated with the nature of learning material, while the latter two are influenced by instructional design. Techniques used for cognitive load measurement can be divided into the following categories: subjective rating, performance measures, behavioral measures and physiological measures. The physiological approaches for cognitive load measurement are based on the assumption that any changes in human cognitive functioning are reflected in the human physiology, and have attracted increasing attention. Popular physiological measures used in cognitive load studies include brain wave, eye activity, respiration, heart rate, skin conductance, and speech, etc. Response-based behavioral features for cognitive load measurement are those that can be extracted from any user activity that is predominantly related to deliberate/voluntary task completion. This book focuses on the use of the following modalities for cognitive load measurement: eye, skin conductance, digital pen, speech, linguistic, mouse activity as well as fusions thereof.

VL  - 4

AB  - This paper examines the cognitive load in real-time strategy gaming subjects along with physiological and subjective measurements. The subjects were college students from a northeastern university in China. This paper is a study into players’ cognitive load measurement when playing against human opponents and game artificial intelligences (game AIs). Using eye trackers, action per minute recorders and questionnaires, we collected qualitative data from participants about their cognitive load through playing against human opponents and game AI opponents. The results indicate that players have more cognitive load when playing against human opponents than against game AI opponents. Secondly, as the players’ gaming skill increased, their cognitive load did not differ substantially when they switched from playing against human players to playing against game AI opponents. A deeper understanding of players’ cognitive load can enable a developer to design a more appropriate game experience.

AB  - Replying to corresponding research calls I experimentally investigate whether a higher level of artificial intelligence support leads to a lower user cognitive workload. Applying eye-tracking technology I show how the user’s cognitive workload can be measure more objectively by capturing eye movements and pupillary responses. Within a laboratory environment which adequately reflects a realistic working situation, the probands use two distinct systems with similar user interfaces but very different levels of artificial intelligence support. Recording and analyzing objective eye-tracking data (i.e. pupillary diameter mean, pupillary diameter deviation, number of gaze fixations and eye saccade speed of both left and right eyes) – all indicating cognitive workload – I found significant systematic cognitive workload differences between both test systems. My results indicated that a higher AI-support leads to lower user cognitive workload.

This chapter reports on an exploratory study of data related to one text included in MS13, contained in CRITT Translation Process Research Database, with a view to investigating the impact of type of cohesive chain on cognitive effort in Portuguese-Chinese translation and post-editing tasks. Eye-tracking and key logging data were assessed by means of a linear mixed-effects regression model. The results point to no impact of task on the dependent variables, but to an impact of the type of cohesive relations on target text reading and production. The chapter also contributes to developing a methodology for processing of Translog-II data involving Chinese.

AB  - Deaf and Hard of Hearing students who use visual accommodations face difficulties in following multimedia lectures due to the delay in visual translation and dividing attention between simultaneous visuals. As a result, deaf students miss information. We address these difficulties with two approaches: visual cues and live replay in recorded lectures. Our analysis found that when deaf students view the lecture videos with cues, they show less delay in switching to the active visual information source and report high satisfaction with the cues. The students who liked the cues were more likely to demonstrate reduction in delay time associated with shifting visual attention. Similarly, when deaf students used gaze controlled replay with lecture videos, they miss less information and report high satisfaction with live replay.

The user and the system must have a collaborative goal. The concept of collaborative multimodality could serve as the missing link between traditional HCI and intuitive human-centred designs in the form of, e.g., natural language interfaces or intelligent environments. Examples are provided in the medical imaging domain.

AB  - Animations of American Sign Language (ASL) can make more information, websites, and services accessible for the significant number of deaf people in the United States with lower levels of written language literacy – ultimately leading to fuller social inclusion for these users. We are collecting and analyzing an ASL motion-capture corpus of multi-sentential discourse to seek computational models of various aspects of ASL linguistics to enable us to produce more accurate and understandable ASL animations. In this paper, we will describe our motion-capture studio configuration, our data collection procedure, and the linguistic annotations being added by our research team of native ASL signers. This paper will identify the most effective prompts we have developed for collecting non-scripted ASL passages in which signers use particular linguistic constructions that we wish to study. This paper also describes the educational outreach and social inclusion aspects of our project – the participation of many deaf participants, researchers, and students.

AB  - Bottom-up cortical representations of visual conspicuity interact with top-down internal cognitive models of the external world to control eye movements, EMs, and the closely linked attention-shift mechanisms; to thus achieve visual recognition. Conspicuity operators implemented with image processing algorithms, IPAs, can discriminate human Regions-of-Interest, hROIs, the loci of eye fixations, from the rest of the visual stimulus that is not visited during the EM process. This discrimination generates predictability of the hROIs. Further, a combination of IPA-generated conspicuity maps can be used to achieve improved performance over each of the individual composing maps in terms of hROI predictions.

AB  - This paper is a commentary on “Toward Computer-Based Support of Meta-Cognitive Skills: a Computational Framework to Coach Self-Explanation”, by Cristina Conati and Kurt Vanlehn, published in the IJAED in 2000 (Conati and VanLehn 2010). This work was one of the first examples of Intelligent Learning Environments (ILE) that target activities beyond problem solving doing so by providing adaptive support to apply relevant domain independent meta-cognitive skills, as opposed to targeting domain-dependent knowledge. We provide an overview of the SE-Coach, the ILE presented in (Conati and Vanlehn 2000), in terms of underlying motivation, objectives, appeach and contibutions. This overview is followed by a discussion of subsequent developments in research on providing intelligent, student-adaptive support to meta-cognition, as well as of remaining open issues and avenues for future research.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 359
EP  - 373
VL  - 2
IS  - 4
AB  - Two video-based human-computer interaction tools are introduced that can activate a binary switch and issue a selection command. “BlinkLink,” as the first tool is called, automatically detects a user’s eye blinks and accurately measures their durations. The system is intended to provide an alternate input modality to allow people with severe disabilities to access a computer. Voluntary long blinks trigger mouse clicks, while involuntary short blinks are ignored. The system enables communication using “blink patterns:” sequences of long and short blinks which are interpreted as semiotic messages. The second tool, “EyebrowClicker,” automatically detects when a user raises his or her eyebrows and then triggers a mouse click. Both systems can initialize themselves, track the eyes at frame rate, and recover in the event of errors. No special lighting is required. The systems have been tested with interactive games and a spelling program. Results demonstrate overall detection accuracy of 95.6% for BlinkLink and 89.0% for EyebrowClicker.

AB  - Learning analytics in formal learning contexts is often restricted to collect and analyze data from students following curricula through a learning management system. In informal learning, however, a deep understanding of learners and entities interacting with each other is needed. The practice of exploring these interactions is known as community learning analytics. Mobile devices, wearables and interconnected Industry 4.0 production machines equipped with a multitude of sensors collecting vast amounts of data are ideal candidates to capture the goals and activities of informal learning settings. What is missing is a methodological approach to collect, manage, analyze and exploit data coming from such an interconnected network of artifacts. In this paper, we present a concept and prototypical implementation of a framework that is able to gather, transform and visualize data coming from Industry 4.0 and wearable sensors and actuators. Our collaborative Web-based visual analytics platform is highly embeddable and extensible on various levels. Its open source availability fosters research on community learning analytics on a broad level.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this study, we investigated the difference between head-mounted displays (HMDs) and smartphone displays on the priming effects for photo-taking behaviors. HMDs appear to be the successor of mobile displays, including smartphone displays. However, HMDs possibly have their own effects on the human mind and body. It seems that the content shown on displays affect human behavior because users passively see displays frequently. Although the effects of smartphones are not a problem yet, the effects of HMDs are possibly greater than those of smartphones because HMD users see the display anytime, anywhere. It is important that we explore the differences between smartphones and HMDs. This study uses priming effects for comparative research. We focus on application icon images because they are continually seen by users. We experimented on whether users tend to take photographs that are affected by the icon images. We prepared three icon images and confirmed that the participants tend to take photographs that are related to the icon images.

AB  - This study compares the use of a laptop versus a touch-screen PC to perform web-based information search tasks. Thirty-six participants took part in a lab-based experiment. They were asked to use either a laptop or a touch-screen PC to seek information on the web and retrieve relevant pieces of information while their sessions were recorded. Cognitive load was measured through eye-related data and cortical activity (EEG) along with a self-reported scale. Main results indicated that participants who used the laptop outperformed those who used the touch-screen PC, with more relevant webpages bookmarked (F = 9.678, p = .004) and more relevant elements retrieved (F = 6.302, p = .018). Participants with the touch-screen PC also spent more time on each webpage than their counterparts (F = 9.2141, p = .005). These results suggest that using the touch-screen PC required more mental effort, which is supported by cognitive load measurements. Linear mixed-model analyses showed significant differences across devices in both pupil size variation (F = 3.692, p = .05) and EEG-based cognitive load index (F = 5.181, p = .028). This study raises issues about whether touch-screen computers are suited for every computing needs.

AB  - Objective. This paper is to offer relevant theoretical basis and experimental method for future Chinese ink poster designs through the information on differentiation obtained from an in-depth analysis of the concept of design psychology combined with objective examination of the visual perception of Chinese ink poster designs of both professionals and nonprofessionals by means of eye movement experiments. Method. Methods of questionnaire and eye movement experiments were adopted to extract the differentiated information on the visual perceptions of Chinese ink posters of both design professionals and nonprofessionals with the aim of studying and understanding their visual focus and visual perception of poster designs and realizing the “customer-oriented” concept of Chinese ink poster designs. Conclusion. Through data gathering, assessment and analysis, conclusion has been reached that professionals are more concerned about the cultural connotation and aesthetic imagery while nonprofessionals focus more on the information transmission through the hieroglyphs in the posters. The paper argues that Chinese ink poster designs are based on certain psychological theories and tested and evaluated via scientific experiment.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Based on the summary analysis of the development rules of mobile App iteration process, this paper selected six popular mobile phone software whose main navigation styles are iterated from drawer navigation to tabbed navigation, conducted a usability test of six old and new version software through the eye movement experiment, and compared the usability differences before and after the change in navigation style to study which navigation style is more suitable for mobile phone software. It carried out a comparative analysis of the usability of six old and new version software based on task completion rate, task loss degree, the completion time of search task (gaze time), the number of fixation points in browsing task, the time of entering ROI for the first time in browsing task and the time of triggering ROI for the first time obtained from the experiment, combining participants’ subjective satisfaction questionnaires and in-depth interview after the experiment. The results showed that the use of tabbed navigation software is better than that of drawer navigation software, and the usability difference caused by this navigation style is not related to the software type. In addition, this paper summed up usability problems in navigation design according to the experimental results, and provided a reference for interface designers and interaction designers to choose the navigation style and design interface.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Continuous, non-invasive workload indicators of operators is an essential component for dynamically assigning appropriate amount of tasks between automation and operators to prevent overload and out-of-the-loop problems in computer-based procedures. This article examines the monitoring task difficulty manipulated by the task type and load, and explores physiological measurements in relation to mental workload. In a within-subject design experiment, forty-five university students performed monitoring tasks in simulated nuclear power plants (NPPs) control room. The performance of monitoring tasks (accuracy), subjective mental workload (NASA Task Load Index), as well as four eye-related physiological indices were measured and analyzed. The results show that as monitoring task difficulty increased, task performance significantly decreased while NASA-TLX, number of fixations, and dwell time significantly increased. Number of fixations and dwell time could be effective, non-invasive continuous indicators of workload for enabling adaptive computer-based procedures.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify strengths and weaknesses of an eye-gaze input system. The pointing performance of an eye-gaze input, such as reaction time and accuracy, were compared to the performance of a mouse input. Operator’s sensitivity (d’), bias (β) and NASA-TLX were used as metrics for performance assessment during a gauge monitoring task. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in reaction time between a mouse input and eye-gaze input system. The participants who used a mouse as their input device showed more miss responses. However, the eye-gaze device users had more false-alarm responses. For workload, there was no significant difference between the eye-gaze input system and the mouse input system. The findings from this study showed that an eye-gaze system is favorable to the operations requiring fast human reactions and less sensitivity on false. The study provided deeper insight into user behavior regarding an eye-gaze input system.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper presents an experimental evaluation of eye gaze data as a source for modeling user’s learning in Interactive Simulations (IS). We compare the performance of classifier user models trained only on gaze data vs. models trained only on interface actions vs. models trained on the combination of these two sources of user interaction data. Our long-term goal is to build user models that can trigger adaptive support for students who do not learn well with ISs, caused by the often unstructured and open-ended nature of these environments. The test-bed for our work is the CSP applet, an IS for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Our findings show that including gaze data as an additional source of information to the CSP applet’s user model significantly improves model accuracy compared to using interface actions or gaze data alone.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - This paper tries to identify increases in user frustration when using Eye-Tracking devices as compared to common interfacing devices like a standard mouse. For this, we used an electroencephalograph (EEG) to measure frustration levels while users navigated within a maze using each of the referred devices. Results from the analysis performed on the EEG data indicate that Eye-tracking has the same amount of frustration as a standard mouse for common mouse tracking tasks. In addition, a correlation between the user’s reported frustration and the extracted EEG data could not be found rendering the above result virtually invalid. The users’ self-reported frustration lends support to our hypothesis but it still is not statistically significant and hence does not confirm the hypothesis.

VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Eye gaze trackers (EGTs) are generally developed for scientific exploration in controlled environments or laboratories and data have been used in ophthalmology, neurology, psychology, and related areas to study oculomotor characteristics and abnormalities, and their relation to cognition and mental states. The illumination is one of the most restrictive limitation of the EGTs, due to a problem of pupil center estimation during illumination changes. Most of the current systems, indeed, work under controlled illumination conditions either in dark or indoor environments, e.g. using infrared sources or conforming the sources of light to fixed levels or pointing directions. This work is focused on exploring and comparing several photometric normalization techniques to improve EGT systems during light changes. In particular, a new wearable and wireless eye tracking system (HATCAM) is used for testing the different techniques in terms of real-time capability, eye tracking and pupil area detection. Embedding real-time image enhancement into the HATCAM can make it an innovative and robust system for eye tracking in different lighting conditions, i.e. darkness, sunlight, indoor and outdoor environments.

AB  - Computational modeling of visual saliency has become an important research problem in recent years, with applications in video quality estimation, video compression, object tracking, retargeting, summarization, and so on. While most visual saliency models for dynamic scenes operate on raw video, several models have been developed for use with compressed-domain information such as motion vectors and transform coefficients. This paper presents a comparative study of eleven such models as well as two high-performing pixel-domain saliency models on two eye-tracking datasets using several comparison metrics. The results indicate that highly accurate saliency estimation is possible based only on a partially decoded video bitstream. The strategies that have shown success in compressed-domain saliency modeling are highlighted, and certain challenges are identified as potential avenues for further improvement.

JO  - Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
SP  - 497
VL  - 20
IS  - 6
AB  - Today’s personal computers enable complex forms of user interaction. Unlike older mainframe computers that required batch processing, personal computers enable real-time user control on a one-to-one basis. Such user interaction involves mixed initiative, logic, language and pointing gestures, features reminiscent of interaction with another human. Yet there are also major differences between computer interaction and human interaction, such as computers’ inability to stray from scripts or to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of particular recipients or situations. Given these similarities and differences, can we study computer interaction using methods similar to those for studying human interaction? If so, are the findings from the analysis of human interaction also useful in understanding computer interaction? In this paper, we explore these questions and outline a novel methodological approach for examining human-computer interaction, which we call “computer interaction analysis.” We build on earlier approaches to human interaction with a computer and adapt them to the latest technologies for computer screen capture and eye tracking. In doing so, we propose a new transcription notation scheme that is designed to represent the interweaving streams of input actions, display events and eye movements. Finally we demonstrate the approach with concrete examples involving the phenomena of placeholding, repair and referential practices.

AB  - This chapter gives an overview of primarily interactive applications mainly developed by computer science researchers. Following the hierarchy of eye tracking systems given earlier, apart from diagnostic usability studies, this chapter focuses on two types of interactive applications: selective and gaze-contingent. The former approach uses an eye tracker as an input device, similar in some ways to a mouse. This type of ocular interaction is often studied by researchers involved in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW). The latter gaze-contingent application is a type of display system wherein the information presented to the viewer is generally manipulated to match the processing capability of the Human Visual System, often matching foveo-peripheral perception in real-time. It should be noted that a good deal of previous work discussed in this chapter is based on conference proceedings.

TI  - Computer image generation for flight simulators: the Gabor approach
JO  - The Visual Computer
SP  - 93
EP  - 105
VL  - 6
IS  - 2
AB  - A formalism for image representation in the combined frequency-position space is presented using the generalized Gabor approach. This approach uses elementary functions to which the human visual system is particularly sensitive and which are efficient for the analysis and synthesis of visual imagery. The formalism is also compatible with the implementation of a variable resolution system wherein image information is nonuniformly distributed across the visual field in accordance with the human visual system's ability to process it. When used with a gaze-slaved visual display system, imagery generated using the techniques described here affords a combination of high resolution and wide field-of-view. This combination is particularly important in high-fidelity, computergenerated, visual environments as required, for instance, in flight simulators.

AB  - We present in this paper a study of concavity detection using binary edge mask information, and consistency links between them. A model for a corner is proposed as a particular arrangement of edge masks. In a second step, we merge these corner in order to build concavities. Enclosures are obtained as a particular case of concavities. Examples are shown in the context of suburban area and more particularly in house images. We also discuss, about the limits of this approach in terms of information provided by the edge masks and propose some improvements in order to extend our concavity definition.

AB  - Profile-driven personalization based on socio-demographics is currently regarded as the most convenient base for successful personalized advertising. However, signs point to the dormant power of context recognition: Advertising systems that can adapt to the situational context of a consumer will rapidly gain importance. While technologies that can sense the environment are increasingly advanced, questions such as what to sense and how to adapt to a consumer’s context are largely unanswered. In this chapter, we analyze the purchase context of a retail outlet and conceptualize it such that adaptive pervasive advertising applications really deliver on their potential: showing the right message at the right time to the right recipient.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The main goal of this work is to evaluate the feasibility to calculate the technical debt (a traditional software quality approach) in a model-driven context through the same tools used by software developers at work. The SonarQube tool was used, so that the quality check was performed directly on projects created with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) instead of traditionals source code projects. In this work, XML was used as the model specification language to verify in SonarQube due to the creation of EMF metamodels in XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) and that SonarQube offers a plugin to assess the XML language. After this, our work focused on the definition of model rules as an XSD schema (XML Schema Definition) and the integration between EMF-SonarQube in order that these metrics were directly validated by SonarQube; and subsequently, this tool determined the technical debt that the analyzed EMF models could contain.

AB  - Both business processes and business rules focus on creating a representation of the organization’s policies and practices. They are complementary modelling approaches as they address distinct aspects of organizational practices. The conceptual and pragmatic overlap between business process models and business rules indicates a need to model the two related aspects together. While researchers have argued that integrated modelling of business process models and business rules can improve the understanding of business processes, this proposition has neither been theoretically analysed nor empirically evaluated. Moreover, there are situations in which a business rule is better modelled independently of a business process model, but also situations in which it is more appropriate to integrate the rule with a business process model.

AB  - In this thesis, criteria and guidelines on how to design search user interfaces for children have been proposed and discussed. They contribute in different ways to the achievement of the overall main goal: the development of interactive systems for information search for children as a targeted user group with special focus on the user interface. The work is summarised in Section 10.1. Section 10.2 points out the main contributions of this thesis. But while arguably significant steps have been taken, the problem is still only partially solved. Section 10.3 discusses limitations of the proposed approaches and points out directions of future research.

AB  - Program comprehension is an important human factor in software engineering. To measure and evaluate program comprehension, researchers typically conduct experiments. However, designing experiments requires considerable effort, because confounding parameters need to be controlled for. Our aim is to support researchers in identifying relevant confounding parameters and select appropriate techniques to control their influence. To this end, we conducted a literature survey of 13 journals and conferences over a time span of 10 years. As result, we created a catalog of 39 confounding parameters, including an overview of measurement and control techniques. With the catalog, we give experimenters a tool to design reliable and valid experiments.

AB  - The development of closed-loop systems is fraught with many challenges. One of the many important decisions to be made in this development is the selection of suitable metrics to detect operator state. Successful metrics can inform adaptations in an interface’s design, features, or task elements allocated to automated systems. This paper will discuss various challenges and considerations involved in the selection of metrics for detecting fatigue in operators of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using Eggemeier and colleague’s guidelines for workload metric selection as a basis, we review several criteria for metric selection and how they are applied to selection of metrics designed to assess operator fatigue in an applied closed-loop system.

EP  - 1105
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Intelligence analysts are bombarded with enormous volumes of imagery, which they must visually filter through to identify relevant areas of interest. Interpretation of such data is subject to error due to (1) large data volumes, implying the need for faster and more effective processing, and (2) misinterpretation, implying the need for enhanced analyst/system effectiveness. This paper outlines the Revolutionary Accelerated Processing Image Detection (RAPID) System, designed to significantly improve data throughput and interpretation by incorporating advancing neurophysiological technology to monitor processes associated with detection and identification of relevant target stimuli in a non-invasive and temporally precise manner. Specifically, this work includes the development of innovative electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye tracking technologies to detect and flag areas of interest, potentially without an analyst’s conscious intervention or motor responses, while detecting and mitigating problems with tacit knowledge, such as anchoring bias in real-time to reduce the possibility of human error.

BT  - HCI in Work and Learning, Life and Leisure
SP  - 291
EP  - 304
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - At work and at leisure people perform various visual search tasks, e.g. they search for a particular icon in software tools, on Web sites or on mobile phones. With an increasing number of items, visual search becomes difficult. Recently, it has been suggested that the so-called contextual cueing effect, which is known from psychological experiments, can be applied to improve visual search performance. Contextual cueing leads to decreased search times for target objects within familiar context configurations. It is assumed that associations between context configurations and target locations are learned implicitly and then used to guide the allocation of attention to the relevant object. In accordance with demands for interface consistency, this mechanism could be interesting for the development of user interfaces. The present study investigated which object features (e.g. color or orientation) can establish the learning process. The results show that implicit learning of color and orientation arrangements are possible, but the transfer to configuration with changed features depends on the recent learning history. Implications of these results are discussed with respect to the design of user interfaces.

AB  - The use of semantic representations in document-oriented environments – as formal annotations or embedded instances of a formal knowledge base – is seen as an enabling technology for intelligent services which may help knowledge workers in tasks like finding, structuring, or assessing information. Also, a high level of formalization has potential to directly support problem solving, e.g., by the application of inferencing services. A coupling of textual and formal representations in document-centered knowledge work raises, amongst others, two questions: i) How can the acquisition of formal knowledge in such an environment be facilitated? ii) How can the potential complexity of formal annotations during a document’s life and use cycle be adequately handled?

AB  - This paper describes two lines of research addressing the use of biosensors for populations with disabilities. The first line of research focused on deriving changing cognitive state information from the patterns of data acquired from users with the goal of improving presentation of multimedia computer information. Detecting individual differences via performance and psychometric tools can be supplemented by using real-time physiological sensors such as eye tracking and pressure applied to a computer mouse. We describe a computer task that demonstrates how to identify cognitive state and discuss types of physiological and cognitive state measures and associated advantages and disadvantages. Adaptive information filtering is discussed as a model for using the physiological information to improve individual performance. In the second line of research we interviewed participants with disabilities in an engineering vocational training program about their needs and suggestions for assistive devices that incorporate biosensors.

AB  - From the early steps of sketching to final engineering, a frequent and very important activity in designing objects is to perform graphical and spatial simulations to solve the constraints on the objects which are being designed. But when we analyse work situations involving the use of CAD systems, it is today an acknowledged fact that these tools are not helpful to perform these types of simulations. While knowledge modeling based on form feature concepts already offers some possibilities for attaching behaviour to objects, the simulation activity requires in addition a ‘real time’ and ‘intelligent’ management of the interactions between the 3D virtual objects and the CAD user.

AB  - This study investigates how pedagogical conversational agents can facilitate learner-learner collaborative learning during a knowledge integration task. The study focuses on (1) how knowledge integration activity can be facilitated by using multiple Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) with gaze gestures and (2) how dyad coordination influences learners’ perspective-changing processes and understanding. In a controlled experiment, dyads were accompanied by multiple PCAs programmed to facilitate learning. Two eye-trackers were used to detect the learner’s learning process and coordination. The results show that learners who received facilitation from the PCAs about integrating different perspectives performed better on the task, and if they received gaze gestures, they tended to focus on the relationship of different knowledge as well. Recurrence analysis of gaze patterns show that those who performed well using PCAs synchronized their gaze.

AB  - Existing Web design guidelines give conflicting advice on the best position for the navigation menu. One set of guidelines is based on user expectation of layout, the other on results from user testing with alternative layouts. To resolve this conflict we test whether placing the menu in an unexpected position has a negative impact on search performance. The results show that users rapidly adapt to an unexpected screen layout. We conclude that designers should not be inhibited in applying design recommendations that violate layout conventions as long as consistency is maintained within a site.

AB  - Forms and disclosures are a central component of business and customer interactions. However, they often lack good visual organization or clear and concise language, highlighting a distinct need for more extensive usability testing and research. In particular, eye tracking serves as an excellent tool for evaluating and improving paper and electronic forms. In this paper, we present numerous examples of the benefits of eye tracking for form usability as well as practical considerations for conducting eye tracking on paper forms. In addition, we provide two case studies of paper form eye tracking. One involves a paper diary designed to track users’ television viewing habits and the other is a multi-page government form. Our experiences suggest that paper forms are amenable to traditional usability testing practices and also benefit from the additional insights gained through eye tracking.

JO  - Frontiers of Computer Science
SP  - 396
EP  - 412
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - We present a very different cause of search engine user behaviors—fascination. It is generally identified as the initial effect of a product attribute on users’ interest and purchase intentions. Considering the fact that in most cases the cursor is driven directly by a hand to move via a mouse (or touchpad), we use the cursor movement as the critical feature to analyze the personal reaction against the fascinating search results. This paper provides a deep insight into the goal-directed cursor movement that occurs within a remarkably short period of time (<30 milliseconds), which is the interval between a user’s click-through and decision-making behaviors. Instead of the fundamentals, we focus on revealing the characteristics of the split-second cursor movement. Our empirical findings showed that a user may push or pull the mouse with a slightly greater strength when fascinated by a search result. As a result, the cursor slides toward the search result with an increased momentum. We model the momentum through a combination of translational and angular kinetic energy calculations. Based on Fitts’ law, we implement goal-directed cursor movement identification. Supported by the momentum, together with other physical features, we built different fascination-based search result reranking systems. Our experiments showed that goal-directed cursor momentum is an effective feature in detecting fascination. In particular, they show feasibility in both the personalized and cross-media cases. In addition, we detail the advantages and disadvantages of both click-through rate and cursor momentum for re-ranking search results.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are currently attracting a great deal of attention as a part of the discourse surrounding the fourth industrial revolution. Thus far, the chief focus has been upon complex architectures for supply chain-wide data exchange between intelligent machines. Here, however, we take a very different tack by examining the support CPS may offer for the exchange and acquisition of knowledge-intensive human practices in the context of manual set-up processes on modern production machines. The paper offers contributions to both CSCW and the ongoing development of CPS in three ways. Firstly, it presents a detailed empirical study of knowledge and expertise sharing practices in a production environment. Secondly, the results of this study are used as the basis of an over-arching model that was developed with the express purpose of facilitating design. Finally, CPS-based technical possibilities are matched to the practice-relevant knowledge and expertise sharing requirements captured within the model.

AB  - A virtual reality driving simulator is designed as a tool for improving driving skills of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Training at an appropriate driving difficulty level can maximize long term performance. Affective state information has been used for difficulty level adjustment in our previous work. This paper integrates performance with affective state information to predict the optimal difficulty level. The participant’s performance data, physiology signals, and eye gaze data are captured. The performance features and affective state features are extracted. Two classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are implemented to predict difficulty level. The results demonstrate that performance together with affective state information outperform the separated features in difficulty level prediction. A highest accuracy of 83.09% is achieved with the integrated features.

AB  - Our aim is to explore raw data quality in the first evaluation of the first fully playable prototype of a social-serious-game-based, multi-modal, interactive software system for screening for high functioning cases of autism spectrum condition at kindergarten age. Data were collected from 10 high functioning children with autism spectrum condition and 10 typically developing children. Mouse and eye-tracking data, and data from automated emotional facial expression recognition were analyzed quantitatively. Results show a sub-optimal level of raw data quality and suggest that it is a bottleneck in developing screening/diagnostic/assessment tools based on multi-mode behavioral data.

We also show the importance of the choice of the base simple to the performance of our skin analysis techniques. We present the details and the process of construction of our database which we have called “the ECL Skin-color Images Database from video ”. We will show that the use of a database derived from live video gives better results than one derived from internet images for face detection in video application.

AB  - Computational models of visual attention have attracted strong interest by accurately predicting how humans deploy attention. However, little research has utilized these models to detect clinical populations whose attention control has been affected by neurological disorders. We designed a framework to decypher disorders from the joint analysis of video and patients’ natural eye movement behaviors (watch television for 5 minutes). We employ convolutional deep neural networks to extract visual features in real-time at the point of gaze, followed by SVM and Adaboost to classify typically developing children vs. children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), who exhibit impaired attentional control. The classifier achieved 74.1% accuracy (ROC: 0.82). Our results demonstrate that there is substantial information about attentional control in even very short recordings of natural viewing behavior. Our new method could lead to high-throughput, low-cost screening tools for identifying individuals with deficits in attentional control.

BT  - Visual Content Indexing and Retrieval with Psycho-Visual Models
SP  - 43
EP  - 74
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Deep Neural Networks have become winners in indexing of visual information. They have allowed achievement of better performances in the fundamental tasks of visual information indexing and retrieval such as image classification and object recognition. In fine-grain indexing tasks, namely object recognition in visual scenes, the CNNs classifiers have to evaluate multiple “object proposals”, that is windows in the image plane of different size and location. Hence the problem of recognition is coupled with the problem of localization. In this chapter a model of prediction of Areas-if-Interest in video on the basis of Deep CNNs is proposed. A Deep CNN architecture is designed to classify windows in salient and non-salient. Then dense saliency maps are built upon classification score results. Using the known sensitivity of human visual system (HVS) to residual motion, the usual primary features such as pixel colour values are completed with residual motion features. The experiments show that the choice of the input features for the Deep CNN depends on visual task: for the interest in dynamic content, the proposed model with residual motion is more efficient.

AB  - Focusing on deixis in human computer interaction this paper presents interdisciplinary work on the use of co-verbal gesture . Empirical investigations, theoretical modeling, and computational simulations with an anthropomorphic agent are based upon comparable settings and common representations. Findings pertain to the coordination of verbal and gestural constituents in deictic utterances. We discovered high variability in the temporal synchronization of such constituents in task-oriented dialogue, and a theoretical treatment thereof is presented. With respect to simulation we exemplarily show how the influence of situational characteristics on the choice of verbal and nonverbal constituents can be accounted for. In particular, this depends on spatio-temporal relations between speaker and the objects they refer to in dialogue.

EP  - 471
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The use of eye movements to study cognitive effort is becoming increasingly important in HCI research. Eye movements are natural and frequently occurring human behavior. In particular fixations represent attention; people look at something when they want to acquire information from it. Users also tend to cluster their attention on informative regions of a visual stimulus. Thus, fixation duration is often used to measure attention and cognitive processing. Additionally, parameters such as pupil dilation and fixation durations have also been shown to be representative of information processing. In this study we argue that fixation density, defined as the number of gaze points divided by the total area of a fixation event, can serve as a proxy for information processing. As such, fixation density has a significant relationship with pupil data and fixation duration, which have been shown to be representative of cognitive effort and information processing.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Most previous studies on visual saliency have only focused on static or dynamic 2D scenes. Since the human visual system has evolved predominantly in natural three dimensional environments, it is important to study whether and how depth information influences visual saliency. In this work, we first collect a large human eye fixation database compiled from a pool of 600 2D-vs-3D image pairs viewed by 80 subjects, where the depth information is directly provided by the Kinect camera and the eye tracking data are captured in both 2D and 3D free-viewing experiments. We then analyze the major discrepancies between 2D and 3D human fixation data of the same scenes, which are further abstracted and modeled as novel depth priors. Finally, we evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art saliency detection models over 3D images, and propose solutions to enhance their performances by integrating the depth priors.

CY  - London
AB  - Over the last several decades, facial recognition technology has become increasingly accurate. However, despite advances in technology, these systems are not yet as good as what was envisioned in crime scene investigation (CSI) films. For example, facial recognition technology failed in the Boston Marathon bombing manhunt in 2013 (Gallagher S (2013) Why facial recognition tech failed in the Boston bombing manhunt. http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/why-facial-recognition-tech-failed-in-the-boston-bombing-manhunt/). The two bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were both in the facial image database. There were photos of the suspects, but the system could not find a match, or at least could not come up with one before the suspects were identified by humans. Under the best circumstances, facial recognition can be extremely accurate, returning the right person as a potential match within ideal conditions, e.g. front-view faces where all photos are shot from the same angle and with the same lighting. To reach that level of accuracy in real-world footage, which is often blurry, with different poses and lighting, computers almost always require a degree of skilled human guidance. According to the NIST report on the evaluation of 2D still-image facial recognition algorithms, the facial recognition accuracy rate decreases linearly with the logarithm of the population size of the image database. In all cases, human adjudication is ultimately necessary for verification (Grother P, Quinn GW, and Philips PJ (2011) Report on the evaluation of 2D still-image face recognition algorithms. NIST Interagency Report 7709, August 24, 2011).

AB  - In this paper, we provide an overview of our research on multimodal media and contents using embodied lifelike agents. In particular we describe our research centered on MPML (Multimodal Presentation Markup Language). MPML allows people to write and produce multimodal contents easily, and serves as a core for integrating various components and functionalities important for multimodal media. To demonstrate the benefits and usability of MPML in a variety of environments including animated Web, 3D VRML space, mobile phones, and the physical world with a humanoid robot, several versions of MPML have been developed while keeping its basic format. Since emotional behavior of the agent is an important factor for making agents lifelike and for being accepted by people as an attractive and friendly human-computer interaction style, emotion-related functions have been emphasized in MPML. In order to alleviate the workload of authoring the contents, it is also required to endow the agents with a certain level of autonomy. We show some of our approaches towards this end.

AB  - This work aims to identify the main aspects of Web design responsible for eliciting specific emotions. For this purpose, we performed a user study with 40 participants testing a Web application designed by applying a set of criteria for stimulating various emotions. In particular, we considered six emotions (hate, anxiety, boredom, fun, serenity, love), and for each of them a specific set of design criteria was exploited. The purpose of the study was to reach a better understanding regarding what design techniques are most important to stimulate each emotion. We report on the results obtained and discuss their implications. Such results can inform the development of guidelines for Web applications able to stimulate users’ emotions.

AB  - The advances of technology have profoundly improved the way people live and work. However, accompanying fast-paced technological development is information overload, which can minimise our capacity for cognitive processing and our ability to make quality decisions. We conducted extensive user research to identify needs and problems of contemporary office workers. Based on the insights of these real needs, the concept of a system called Cognitive Hub has been developed which supports an activity-based new metaphor for work, user state adaptation, smart enterprise search, smart transformation between physical and digital contents and multimodal interaction. Konica Minolta is thus developing Cognitive Hub as a platform that will serve as a nexus for users’ information flows within the digital workplace. Cognitive Hub will also provide AI-based services to improve work experience and the well-being of office workers. A demonstrator was created to show the concept in action and illustrate its benefits and value for users.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper addresses the development of an adaptive cooperative agent in a domain that suffers from human error in the allocation of attention. The design is discussed of a component of this adaptive agent, called Human Attention-Based Task Allocator (HABTA), capable of managing agent and human attention. The HABTA-component reallocates the human’s and agent’s focus of attention to tasks or objects based on an estimation of the current human allocation of attention and by comparison of this estimation with certain normative rules. The main contribution of the present paper is the description of the combined approach of design and validation for the development of such components. Two complementary experiments of validation of HABTA are described. The first experiment validates the model of human attention that is incorporated in HABTA, comparing estimations of the model with those of humans. The second experiment validates the HABTA-component itself, measuring its effect in terms of human-agent team performance, trust, and reliance. Finally, some intermediary results of the first experiment are shown, using human data in the domain of naval warfare.

VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Testing is the most widely adopted practice to ensure software quality. However, this activity is often a compromise between the available resources and software quality. In object-oriented development, testing effort should be focused on defective classes. Unfortunately, identifying those classes is a challenging and difficult activity on which many metrics, techniques, and models have been tried. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of elementary design evolution metrics to identify defective classes. The metrics include the numbers of added, deleted, and modified attributes, methods, and relations. The metrics are used to recommend a ranked list of classes likely to contain defects for a system. They are compared to Chidamber and Kemerer’s metrics on several versions of Rhino and of ArgoUML. Further comparison is conducted with the complexity metrics computed by Zimmermann et al. on several releases of Eclipse. The comparisons are made according to three criteria: presence of defects, number of defects, and defect density in the top-ranked classes. They show that the design evolution metrics, when used in conjunction with known metrics, improve the identification of defective classes. In addition, they show that the design evolution metrics make significantly better predictions of defect density than other metrics and, thus, can help in reducing the testing effort by focusing test activity on a reduced volume of code.

AB  - This explorative eye tracking study investigates visual attention and perceptions of usability within eGovernment environments. We argue that such insights help in understanding users for better design of user Web experiences. In an initial test to identify areas of interest (AOI) on public sector websites, subjects (n = 8) were exposed to the start page of ten different websites with slightly different designs. Two websites (old versus new design) were then selected to investigate attention to different visual elements (n = 16). The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to investigate performance on usability metrics. The results indicate differences in viewing behavior and visual attention across different designs, in terms of both eye tracking metrics and usability scores. The concluding remarks include suggestions for further research.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Impairments in social communication skills are thought to be core deficits in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In recent years, several assistive technologies, particularly Virtual Reality (VR), have been investigated to promote social interactions in this population. It is well-known that these children demonstrate atypical viewing patterns during social interactions and thus monitoring eye-gaze can be valuable to design intervention strategies. However, presently available VR-based systems are designed to chain learning via aspects of one’s performance only permitting limited degree of individualization. Given the promise of VR-based social interaction and the usefulness of monitoring eye-gaze in real-time, a novel VR-based dynamic eye-tracking system is developed in this work. The developed system was tested through a small usability study with four adolescents with ASD. The results indicate the potential of the system to promote improved social task performance along with socially-appropriate mechanisms during VR-based social conversation tasks.

AB  - Children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually experience impairment in social interaction and often display reduced gaze sharing when interacting with another person. The lack of gaze sharing or joint attention early in the children’s developmental stage may create a delay in their ability to learn new things and share information with others. The presented study involved the design of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based training game with an avatar and eye tracker aimed to eventually address the joint attention impairment in children with ASD. The assistive avatar provides necessary cues and hints based on both the eye tracking data recorded by the VR system and the task performance of the participant. The system uses the task performance to adaptively change the difficulty level of the game. We believe that the training game will be able to improve participant’s gaze following skill. A usability study was carried out to validate the system design. The result showed that the system was feasible and able to obtain the expected gaze performance from the participants. The details of the system architecture and result of system validation are presented in this paper.

AB  - The automatic detection of human affective states has been of great interest lately for its applications not only in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, but also for its applications in physiological, neurobiological and sociological studies. Several standardized techniques to elicit emotions have been used, with emotion eliciting movie clips being the most popular. To date, there are only four studies that have been carried out to validate emotional movie clips using three different languages (English, French, Spanish) and cultures (French, Italian, British / American). The context of language and culture is an underexplored area in affective computing. Considering cultural and language differences between Western and Arab countries, it is possible that some of the validated clips, even when dubbed, will not achieve similar results. Given the unique and conservative cultures of the Arab countries, a standardized and validated framework for affect studies is needed in order to be comparable with current studies of different cultures and languages. In this paper, we describe a framework and its prerequisites for eliciting emotions that could be used for affect studies on an Arab population. We present some aspects of Arab culture values that might affect the selection and acceptance of emotion eliciting video clips. Methods for rating and validating Arab emotional clips are presented to derive at a list of clips that could be used in the proposed emotion elicitation framework. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate a basic version of our framework, which showed great potential to succeed in eliciting emotions.

AB  - An efficient and robust pupil tracking system is an important tool in visual optics and ophthalmology. It is also central to techniques for gaze tracking, of use in psychological and medical research, marketing, human–computer interaction, virtual reality and other areas. A typical setup for pupil tracking includes a camera linked to infrared LED illumination. In this work, we evaluate and parallelize several pupil tracking algorithms with the aim of accurately estimating the pupil position and size in both eyes simultaneously, to be applied in a high-speed binocular pupil tracking system. To achieve high processing speed, the original non-parallel algorithms have been parallelized by using CUDA and OpenMP. Modern graphics processors are designed to process images at high temporal frequencies and spatial resolution, and CUDA enables them to be used for general-purpose computing. Our implementation allows for efficient binocular pupil tracking at high speeds for high-resolution images (up to 988 fps with images of $$1280\times 1024$$1280×1024pixels) using a state-of-the-art GPU.

BT  - Human-Computer Interaction – INTERACT 2019
SP  - 255
EP  - 281
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - As it becomes more common for humans to work alongside artificial agents on everyday tasks, it is increasingly important to design artificial agents that can understand and interact with their human counterparts naturally. We posit that an effective way to do this is to harness nonverbal cues used in human-human interaction. We, therefore, leverage knowledge from existing work on gaze-based intention recognition, where the awareness of gaze can provide insights into the future actions of an observed human subject. In this paper, we design and evaluate the use of a proactive intention-aware gaze-enabled artificial agent that assists a human player engaged in an online strategy game. The agent assists by recognising and communicating the intentions of a human opponent in real-time, potentially improving situation awareness. Our first study identifies the language requirements for the artificial agent to communicate the opponent’s intentions to the assisted player, using an inverted Wizard of Oz method approach. Our second study compares the experience of playing an online strategy game with and without the assistance of the agent. Specifically, we conducted a within-subjects study with 30 participants to compare their experience of playing with (1) detailed AI predictions, (2) abstract AI predictions, and (3) no AI predictions but with a live visualisation of their opponent’s gaze. Our results show that the agent can facilitate awareness of another user’s intentions without adding visual distraction to the interface; however, the cognitive workload was similar across all three conditions, suggesting that the manner in which the agent communicates its predictions requires further exploration. Overall, our work contributes to the understanding of how to support human-agent teams in a dynamic collaboration scenario. We provide a positive account of humans interacting with an intention-aware artificial agent afforded by gaze input, which presents immediate opportunities for improving interactions between the counterparts.

AB  - Usability has played a big role in refining the design of a website. Effective design of e-commerce web interfaces potentially increases perceived trust of its consumers. It is thus critical that e-commerce designers understand usability issues pertaining to e-commerce. However, usability looks only at functionalities and we have moved beyond usability towards user’s emotions. The purpose of this study is to design a preliminary checklist using Kansei Engineering for an e-commerce perspective, which can contribute towards trust and purchase intention of consumers in the Malaysia context. A usability evaluation method was conducted, Feedback Capture after Task (FCAT) using the URANUS tool. It was performed on an online gift shop with a group of potential consumers with age range of 18-22. Using Kansei Engineering, we manage to extract words that are mentioned by the users, in which we have categorized it as per Kansei Concept. There are four categories, namely aesthetic, physical, sensational and operational. This research is deemed important in which future web designers could use as a guideline to design an e-commerce website that focuses on perceived trust and purchase intentions based on Kansei Engineering.

AB  - Gaze signals, frequently used by the sighted in social interactions as visual cues, are hardly accessible for low-vision and blind people. In this paper, we proposed a prototype, namely Tactile Band, to aim at testing the hypothesis that tactile feedback can enable the blind person to feel attention (gaze signals) from the sighted, enhancing the level of engagement in face-to-face communication. We tested our hypothesis with 30 participants with a face-to-face conversation scenario, in which the blindfolded and the sighted participants talked about a given daily topic. Comments from the participants and the reflection on the experiment provided useful insights for improvements and further research.

EP  - 811
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we investigate how to use future interaction technologies to enhance learning technologies. We examine in detail how tracking the mouse pointer and observing the user’s gaze can help to monitor the use of web applications and in particular E-learning applications. To improve learning and teaching, it is of interest to understand in what order and to what extent users read texts, how much time they spend on individual parts of the teaching materials, and where they get stuck. Based on a standard web browser as an application platform, extended with a gaze tracking facility, we conducted studies to explore the feasibility of this novel approach. The concept includes an extension of current technologies to allow JavaScript code running in the browser to access the current gaze position of the user. Our work shows how pieces of web technology and eye gaze tracking can be put together to create a new platform for E-learning that provides additional benefits for learners and teachers.

AB  - When our computers act in unexpected (and unhelpful) ways, we become frustrated with them. Were the computers human assistants, they would react by doing something to mitigate our frustration and increase their helpfulness. However, computers typically do not know we are frustrated. This paper presents research showing that user frustration can be detected with good accuracy (84%) using only two types of input data (head tilt and pupil dilation). We also show that reasonable accuracy (73%) can be achieved using only information about head tilt. We then propose how such technology could be employed to reduce learner frustration in adaptive tutoring applications.

EP  - 112
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In a modern warfare as well as in reconnaissance operations it is on one hand highly important to hide and protect own troops but on the other hand find and target the enemy. Target identification is often based on visual examination of video or still images produced by for example by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or other means of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). In the present study we examined the perception, detection and identification of real and decoy tanks among a total of 28 participants using reaction time tests and eye-tracking recordings during categorizing tasks of images of tanks (real vs. fake; without vs. with camouflage). We found, among other things, that fake and camouflage images of tanks as compared to real and non-camouflage images decreased identification speed. We also found that camouflage images elicited more attention shifting between image and background as compared to non-camouflage images. We argued that this is probable due the fact that as camouflage blurs the image contour and sharpness people seek cues for categorization by switching between image and background. The results are important in understanding the perception and identification of military visual objects in displays and can be used for example in optimization of decoys as well as, in connection with detection, configuring display settings.

AB  - In previous research, we have developed an innovative usability evaluation methodology that is based on total effort metrics (TEM). In this paper we present a novel framework for using the TEM approach along with pattern recognition techniques for identifying user interface deficiencies. The methodology, referred to as pinpoint analysis, identifies time segments where the user expends excessive effort in a task-completion interaction-session. The pinpoint analysis methodology provides software engineers with information that can be used for addressing specific usability deficiencies such as poor arrangement of interface elements. The paper describes the new methodology and reports on pattern recognition and TEM based pinpoint analysis tool that is in advanced stages of development.

AB  - The Transportation Security Administration has a large workforce of Transportation Security Officers, most of whom perform interrogation of x-ray images at the passenger checkpoint. To date, TSOs on the x-ray have been limited to a 30-min session at a time, however, it is unclear where this limit originated. The current paper outlines methods for empirically determining if that 30-min duty cycle is optimal and if there are differences between individual TSOs. This work can inform scheduling TSOs at the checkpoint and can also inform whether TSOs should continue to be cross-trained (i.e., performing all 6 checkpoint duties) or whether specialization makes more sense.

AB  - This paper presents a lifestyle design approach in the design process of the QM (a local furniture manufacture in China) brand design project. The approach was developed to help designers efficiently understand segmented customers’ profile based on market research. Designers can be inspired by lifestyle prototypes generated through the lifestyle design approach. This approach is developed based on three UCD methodology principles: user focus, using prototype and iteration with evaluation. The lifestyle design approach has three steps: concretizing customer profile, creating lifestyle prototype and evaluating lifestyle prototype. We implement the approach in the QM brand design project to deliver several lifestyle prototypes and evaluate them. This paper concludes that the lifestyle design approach can connect costumer research and creative design. It will be of interest to designers and market researchers.

AB  - This paper describes an approach for improving the current systems supporting the exploration and research of scientific literature, which generally adopt a query-based information-seeking paradigm. Our approach is to use a symbiotic system paradigm, exploiting central and peripheral physiological data along with eye-tracking data to adapt to users’ ongoing subjective relevance and satisfaction with search results. The system described, along with the interdisciplinary theoretical work underpinning it, could serve as a stepping stone for the development and diffusion of next-generation symbiotic systems, enabling a productive interdependence between humans and machines. After introducing the concept and evidence informing the development of symbiotic systems over a wide range of application domains, we describe the rationale of the MindSee project, emphasizing its BCI component and pinpointing the criteria around which users’ evaluations can gravitate. We conclude by summarizing the main contribution that MindSee is expected to make.

VL  - 78
IS  - 10
AB  - BCI video games are making brain training increasingly popular and available; yet scientific evidence to support its efficacy is lacking. Real-life descriptions of BCI video games deployments in concrete scenarios are urgently needed. In this paper, we report a use case of the development and pilot-testing of a BCI video game designed to support children with autism when attending to Neurofeedback training sessions, called FarmerKeeper. Caring for children with autism may impose new cognitive, motor, behavioral, and attention challenges that current solutions targeted for other populations may not address. The goal of the game is to maintain children’s attention above a threshold to control a runner who is seeking for lost farm animals. FarmerKeeper uses a consumer-grade BCI headset to read user’s attention. We evaluated FarmerKeeper’s usability and user experience through a 4-weeks deployment study with 12 children with autism. Our quantitative results show FarmerKeeper outperforms a commercial BCI video game used for neurofeedback training, and qualitatively, FarmerKeeper could successfully support children with autism when attending to neurofeedback training sessions by possibly improving their attention and reducing their anxiety. We close reflecting on our design aspects and discussing directions for future work.

AB  - In this study, the development of the objectivity index for the diagnosis of the children who has Kanner syndrome with a lack of the communication ability and an evaluation of the curative effect using the ocular movement measurement is discussed. In past study, we developed communication applications “Eye Talk” and “Eye Tell” for people who have difficulty in conversation and writing such as children with physical disability, ALS patients or elderlies using the blink determination system. The team of Dr. Kitazawa in Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences in Osaka University performed the clinical application to distinguish Kanner syndrome group by measuring “where and when” he/she looks at using Tobii eye tracker. Our study is a judgment by the ocular movement measurement. We developed the image processing technique by afterimage used in the blink determination. First the eye area is captured by a front camera of laptop PC. Second, we extracted the pixels of pupils with 30–40 fps of accuracy and digitized eyeball movements. We converted the difference in eyeball movements between the right and left eyes into a graph and define it in multidimensional measure. We measured the amount of the degree that the eyes of the subject run off the track based on the afterimage, then added up the amount of change of right and left eyes and showed the total. After we corrected data, we set the identification border with density function of the distribution, cumulative frequency function, and ROC curve. With this, we established an objective index to determine Kanner syndrome, normal, false positive, and false negative. Furthermore, after analyzing the data in a two-dimensional coordinate, difference between autistic group and typical developmental group became clear. There were few differences in children who are on the border line between autistic and non-autistic comparing with typical developmental children when we validated with the fixation. However, the identification border could be detected definitely in pursuit.

AB  - Long distance driving has been a major factor leading to road accidents [1-2]. With the lack of reliable validation on driver fatigue technology systems [3], the aim of this study is to correlate the measurements of two cognitive tests: Psychomotor Vigilance Task Tester-PVT [4] and PenScreen-PS [5] to establish the threshold levels of fatigued driving performance that will form the basis to prevent fatigued drivers from handling vehicles. PVT is recommended to be the first line of defense against putting fatigued drivers on duty. Drowsiness can be detected by SmartEye Anti-Sleep-AS, acting as a monitoring tool. Eye closure analysis on AS’s eyelid opening data showed that AS is a feasible system for real-time monitoring of fatigue while driving. The results also suggested a simpler and more economical way of monitoring fatigue using AS system. PS could be used in conjunction with PVT to detect for any malingering intent.

Quantitative evaluation of the proposed system and HFA visual field test results, and calculating the correlation coefficient, we were able to obtain a more moderate positive correlation. This study suggested that the proposed system was potentially useful as an alternate screening device for the detection of the early stage of glaucoma.

TI  - Development of a Quantitative Evaluation Tool of Cognitive Workload in Field Studies Through Eye Tracking

CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye tracking is mainly employed as mean of tracking visual attention of an observer/operator. Still, eye tracking is also capable of recording a wider variety of data such as traces of mental workload. Pupil diameter have been validated as such measure. Most of the studies that have validated this are in laboratory conditions, where the perceived luminance (measured in candela per square meter) can be controlled. Luminance affects the pupil diameter as well; this means if the pupil diameter varies for an operator/observer in field conditions it cannot be accurately determined if the change in the pupil diameter is due to mental workload alone. Although there are some studies, which have attempted to simultaneously account for the contribution of the change in pupil diameter due to luminance and mental workload, not many have attempted to account for this in field conditions for safety-critical systems such as a helicopter or a maritime ship bridge. In this study as a first step, we define a method to measure luminance while tracking the gaze point. We will record eye-tracking data simultaneously recording the video feed of the field of view of the operator/observer. We will use the video feed to estimate the luminous flux from the point of view of the subject. We will be collecting this data from a helicopter pilot and his co-pilot during an actual operation (e.g. transportation of personnel and carrying a payload for an electrical power provider company in Norway or Sweden). We will also be collecting data from a navigator and his first officer in a high-speed marine craft of the Norwegian navy. We will also be collecting subjective data using paper-based tools such as NASA-TLX in addition to a conventional video recording of the scene of activity and handwritten notes of observation for validation purposes. We will also capture mental workload data from a few other objective sources such as heart rate variability (ECG). We expect to clearly define an approach to separately account for the effect of mental workload independent of the impact of changing light conditions in field situations for safety-critical systems. This includes a mathematical model that we innovate based on other mathematical models that are already available in the literature.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 1003

VL  - 16

AB  - A gaze-controlled system was developed to address the specific needs of a person in an advanced stage of Multiple Sclerosis. This patient scored 9 on the EDSS and is representative of a group of patients who can reason normally, but have no functional use of their upper-limbs. The developer and the patient were connected through remote desktop control and could brainstorm a concept to perfection through iterative trial and error. The most important lesson learnt is the importance of user control towards maximum independence. Eventually, the patient was enabled to control his computer efficiently using a novel approach to mouse control together with an on-screen keyboard. He could browse the internet, read e-books, type documents, send and receive e-mails and text messages, draw in a paint application and control his TV through a specially adapted remote control—all by using his eyes to activate commands. The findings suggest that a well-designed eye tracking system can fulfil in the mental and communication needs of patients in this specific category of disability.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 51
EP  - 68
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between oculo-motors, such as eye-movement and pupillary change, and the conventional subjective “usability” index, using time-domain and frequency-domain approaches, with the objective to determine the possibility of evaluating interaction through oculo-motors. An evaluation experiment was conducted by operating a target on a computer display using mouse, keyboard and key pad as input devices. The results show that there is a significant correlation between pupil size and SU-score, which is an established subjective evaluation index for system usability. Cross spectrum densities (CSD) between horizontal and vertical eye-movements and coherence as standardized CSD also significantly correlate with the results of the SU-scores and error rates. To determine the frequency range of CSD and coherence for usability assessment, frequency components used as factors were extracted using factor analysis. According to the correlation coefficients between these and the performance of factor scores for predicting the conventional metrics, factor scores of CSD are better indices for assessing usability than factor scores of coherence. These two results suggest that pupil size and index of eye-movement as oculo-motor indices based on time-domain and frequency-domain approaches can provide information about a system’s overall usability regarding the input operation task.

AB  - We propose a catalog interface for the Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) system. When a user views a product catalog, the system obtains the user’s gaze information and implements evolutionary computation. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed system using evaluation experiments with real users. The experimental results show that the proposed system can generate solutions that offer results equivalent to comparable systems and reduce the evaluation load of the users.

CY  - Cham
AB  - This research proposes a DiAna-AD (dialog analysis for adjusting duration) system that adjusts the duration time of discussions based on the discussion situations. Participants may be dissatisfied with excessive or insufficient fixed time of discussion. The proposed system is intended to terminate the discussions at the appropriate time. The situations of the discussions are estimated only from nonlinguistic acoustic features collected by wearable devices. The criteria of termination by the system are obtained from the analysis of an experiment of satisfaction. The analysis result revealed that the subjective satisfaction of the participants is reduced by the desire to shorten the duration time of the discussion. An algorithm to terminate discussions is implemented via the proposed system. Furthermore, an experiment with the system is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the system for improving participants’ satisfaction in a discussion. The result of the experiment with the system is compared with that of the experiment on satisfaction, and there are no significant differences between the results. On the other hand, from the result of the interview, the proposed DiAna-AD system is found to be effective in shortening the duration time of inactive discussions.

AB  - We present an interactive and diagnostic system for helping children with ADHD and reading weakness to improve their reading skills. The system is designed for educational centres and Namibian museums. It analyses captured eye movements. We present metrics for evaluating reading skills and for measuring relaxation and mental focus. The analysis is used to adapt the displayed information of the educational system. The derived criteria can distinguish skilled readers from ones with difficulties. Persons with reading disorder often have issues in following a line of text. Problems at line breaks are observed. More time for identifying words is needed. It is essential for young readers to learn how to fix their gaze at specific points and to decrease their eye movements. The system includes training phases for enhancing these skills. Fixation durations and skewness and velocity of eye movements are critical parameters for measuring mental focus and relaxation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - A discriminative dictionary-based approach to supporting the classification of 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal images, so as to determine the presence of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), is described. AMD is one of the leading causes of blindness in people aged over 50 years. The proposed approach is founded on the concept of a uniform 3D image decomposition into a set of sub-volumes where each sub-volume is described in terms of a “spatial gradient” histogram, which in turn is used to define a set of feature vectors (one per sub-volume). Feature selection is conducted using the maximum sum of the squared values of each feature vector for each sub-volume. After that, a “coding-pooling” framework is applied so that each image is represented as a single feature vector. The “coding-pooling” framework generates a representative subset of feature vectors called a dictionary, and then use this dictionary as a guide for the generation of a single feature vectors for each volume. Experiments conducted using the proposed approach, in comparison with range of alternatives, indicated that the approach outperformed other existing methods with an accuracy of 95.2%, sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 94.6%.

JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
SP  - 505
EP  - 520
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
AB  - In existing studies about analogical reasoning during idea generation in design, there is lack in quantitative and objective evidences showing the relationship between expertise and the analogy distance. To advance such a state, in this study 43 participants (beginning and advanced students) took part in a design task and their eye movements such as fixation time and saccades were compared. Besides, quantitative analysis of sketches and retrospective interviews were conducted to further explore the relationship between the analogy distance, the fixation level and expertise. The results showed that: (1) compared to advanced students who equally distributed their attention among the three analogy domains, beginning students fixed significantly more on distant domain, although they both used more near and medium analogies in their solutions; (2) beginning students markedly outperformed advanced students in both between-domain and within-domain saccades; (3) beginning students create more ideas and get into high-level design fixation, contrary to advanced students who create a small number of alternative ideas and perform a low level of design fixation. The results clearly offer more accurate and objective evidences showing significant relationships between the cognitive activities of analogical reasoning and expertise and analogy distance, which will bring greater clarity in using analogy in design and teaching analogical reasoning in design education.

BT  - Advances in Brain Inspired Cognitive Systems
SP  - 192
EP  - 200
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - If one neutral object predicts a rewarding or threatening outcome, this object will acquire affective value, and this process is known as affective learning. Western participants showed robust affective learning in previous research. Moreover, affective learning influenced face perception. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. In the present study, we used eye-tracking to investigate whether Chinese participants paid more attention to faces paired with sentences describing negative behaviors in the learning phase. Consistent with Western participants, Chinese participants learned affective information of faces. In addition, the gaze patterns showed that Chinese participants looked more at faces presented with negative and neutral sentences than those presented with positive faces. The present research indicates that affective learning is not impacted by culture. Moreover, participants pay more attention at faces paired with negative and neutral sentences during learning, which may lead to different affective learning effects.

AB  - Based on a large number of different cognitive theories on information processing procedure, suggesting that individuals have different approaches in the way they forage, retrieve, process, store and recall information, this paper investigates the effect of field dependence/independence with regards to visual attention of gamers in the context of a cultural heritage game. Gaze data were collected and analysed from fourteen participants, who were classified as field dependent or independent according to Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), a cognitive style elicitation instrument. The collected data were analysed quantitatively to examine visual attention in terms of fixation count and fixation impact. The results revealed statistically significant differences in both fixation count and fixation impact towards interactive game elements. Statistically significant differences were also measured for specific types of game elements. Findings are expected to provide insights for designers and researchers aiming to design more user–centric cultural heritage games.

AB  - In the contemporary workplace, the design of interfaces has a significant impact on the cognitive demands experienced by operators. Previous approaches to the assessment of these designs have relied on measures of cognitive load to infer the level of cognitive demand imposed. Assessments of cognitive complexity may offer a complimentary measure of the demands of the task as they take into account the inherent nature of the task, rather than idiosyncrasies of the operator. Two studies are reported that examined the information acquisition behavior of pilots in response to a series of simulated flight sequences involving different levels of cognitive complexity. Information acquisition was recorded using an eye tracker. Taken together, the results suggest that assessments of the complexity of a task should be employed as a benchmark in task assessment.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Latent print examinations involve a process by which a latent print, often recovered from a crime scene, is compared against a known standard or sets of standard prints. Despite advances in automatic fingerprint recognition, latent prints are still examined by human expert primarily due to the poor image quality of latent prints. The aim of the present study is to better understand the perceptual and cognitive processes of fingerprint practices as implicit expertise. Our approach is to collect fine-grained gaze data from fingerprint experts when they conduct a matching task between two prints. We then rely on machine learning techniques to discover meaningful patterns from their eye movement data. As the first steps in this project, we compare gaze patterns from experts with those obtained from novices. Our results show that experts and novices generate similar overall gaze patterns. However, a deeper data analysis using machine translation reveals that experts are able to identify more corresponding areas between two prints within a short period of time.

TI  - Disengagement, engagement and digital skills in technology-enhanced learning
JO  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - With the digitalisation of education increasing, the relationship between student engagement in Technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) and digital skills has remained largely unexplored. There is a strong consensus that engagement is necessary for students to succeed in school. We hypothesised that students reporting high and low levels of general engagement display differences in terms of their engagement in TEL, and that students’ digital skills correlate with their engagement in and disengagement in TEL, which in turn is related to their learning outcomes. We used statistical tests to explore the relationship between the students’ (N = 410) general engagement and engagement in TEL, and investigated how digital skills were related to engagement and disengagement in TEL. We found significant correlations between students’ digital skills and engagement in TEL, showing that the possession of high levels of digital skill is related to engagement in TEL. Interestingly, digital skills were not related to disengagement. This suggests that students reporting both high and low levels of digital skills disengage to some extent when learning with technologies. We also identified variables reflecting both engagement and disengagement in TEL that predict student performance as measured via final grades, implying that in order to understand and support students who learn with technologies, a broader understanding of the factors influencing engagement and disengagement is key.

We tracked the gaze of a teacher while he was recording the content for a MOOC lecture. Our working hypothesis is that displaying the gaze of the teacher will act as cues in crucial moments of dyadic conversation, the teacher-student dyad, such as reference disambiguation. We collected data about students’ video interaction behaviour within a MOOC. The results show that the showing the teacher’s gaze made the content easier to follow for the students even when complex visual stimulus present in the video lecture.

AB  - Pie charts can be regularly found both in the popular media and research publications. There is evidence that other forms of visualizations make it easier to evaluate the relative order of the data items. Doughnut charts have been suggested as a variation that has advantages over pie charts. We investigated how pie charts and doughnut charts are affected by the number of sectors in the chart, the difference in sector sizes, and the size of the hole. We carried out an eye tracking study to find out how the charts are read. Our study reveals the distribution of visual attention for each type of chart. The results indicate that doughnut charts with a medium size hole have a slight edge over the other chart types we studied. We also show that contrary to common claims, for information extraction also the area and length of sector arc are used in addition to the angles of the sectors.

BT  - Advances in Visual Computing
SP  - 53

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently begun to exhibit human level performance on some visual perception tasks. Performance remains relatively poor, however, on some vision tasks, such as object detection: specifying the location and object class for all objects in a still image. We hypothesized that this gap in performance may be largely due to the fact that humans exhibit selective attention, while most object detection CNNs have no corresponding mechanism. In examining this question, we investigated some well-known attention mechanisms in the deep learning literature, identifying their weaknesses and leading us to propose a novel attention algorithm called the Densely Connected Attention Model. We then measured human spatial attention, in the form of eye tracking data, during the performance of an analogous object detection task. By comparing the learned representations produced by various CNN architectures with that exhibited by human viewers, we identified some relative strengths and weaknesses of the examined computational attention mechanisms. Some CNNs produced attentional patterns somewhat similar to those of humans. Others focused processing on objects in the foreground. Still other CNN attentional mechanisms produced usefully interpretable internal representations. The resulting comparisons provide insights into the relationship between CNN attention algorithms and the human visual system.

BT  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems
SP  - 422
EP  - 427
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - There is sufficient evidence to show that allowing students to see their own student model is an effective learning and metacognitive strategy. Different tutors have different representations of these open student models, all varying in complexity and detail. EER-Tutor has a number of open student model representations available to the student at any particular time. These include skill meters, kiviat graphs, tag clouds, concept hierarchies, concept lists, and treemaps. Finding out which representation best helps the student at their level of expertise is a difficult task. Do they really understand the representation they are looking at? This paper looks at a novel way of using eye gaze tracking data to see if such data provides us with any clues as to how students use these representations and if they understand them.

BT  - Advances in Multimedia Modeling

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Eye tracking technologies offer sophisticated methods for capturing humans’ gaze direction but their popularity in multimedia and computer graphics systems is still low. One of the main reasons for this are the high cost of commercial eye trackers that comes to 25,000 euros. Interestingly, this price seems to stem from the costs incurred in research rather than the value of used hardware components. In this work we show that an eye tracker of a satisfactory precision can be built in the budget of 30 euros. In the paper detailed instruction on how to construct a low cost pupil-based eye tracker and utilise open source software to control its behaviour is presented. We test the accuracy of our eye tracker and reveal that its precision is comparable to commercial video-based devices.

TI  - Does Length Really Matter? Effects of Number of Pages in the Informed Consent on Reading Behavior: An Eye-Tracking Study
BT  - New Technologies to Improve Patient Rehabilitation
SP  - 116
EP  - 125
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The use of an adequate informed consent (IC) is a current concern in psychological research. A good understanding of the IC is an important step to certify that the participant’s decision to participate in research is informed and free. However, the number of pages in the IC may be a main hinder factor in both reading and understanding the IC. The length of information in ICs has been a matter of debate for a long time, however, no clear guidance has been given. As the reading process requires visual attention, eye movements can provide an objective and quantitative measure of visual behavior that can also be viewed as a proxy of reading behavior. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine how the number of pages in the IC influences reading behavior. Sixty participants were randomly assigned in three experimental conditions (1 page vs. 2 pages vs. 3 pages) while eye movements and the reading time were recorded. Results have shown no differences in average reading time between different lengths. However, a larger number of fixations per word was found at the bottom of the page (area of signature) in the IC with one page in comparison to the bottom of the page in ICs with two or three pages. These findings demonstrate that eye movements are a rich source of information by providing details of relevant/irrelevant contents in the IC.

AB  - This study examines how adults pay attention to cognitive and affective illustrations on a cancer-related webpage and explores age-related differences in the attention to these cognitive and affective webpages. Results of an eye-tracking experiment (n = 20) showed that adults spent more time attending to the illustrations on the cognitive webpage than the illustrations on the affective webpage. Furthermore, older adults spent about 65% less time fixating the webpages than younger adults. Whereas older adults had less attention for illustrations on the cognitive webpage then younger adults, they spent equal time viewing the illustrations on the affective webpage as younger adults.

AB  - The main purpose of this work is to analyse the influence of questions given in perceptual experiments on the reliability of received results. The problem have been investigated in literature, however in a form of theoretical discussion rather than quantitative evaluation. Therefore in the paper in include quantitative evaluation and results visualization. Nevertheless the main novelty is employment of human cognitive style for research questions problem. The analysis was supported with FRIS$$\textregistered $$®[7] that is a psychometric model and also an inventory for cognitive styles measurement. We conduct the user study in order to investigate the way the observers understand research question given during the experiment execution. Therefore two kinds of questions were employed to the experiment: the one not suggesting a response or the one suggesting an answer. In researches we focused on the images’ objects that attach observer’s attention dependent on a structure of a given question. The obtained results were submitted to statistical analysis that proved that correctness of experimental results is highly correlated to the way the research question is designed. The questions that suggesting the answer affects the outcome of the perceptual experiment and make them unreliable. The results confirmed that the human cognitive style is highly correlated with the research questions interpretation.

AB  - Think aloud protocols are widely applied in user experience studies. In this paper, the effect of two different applications of the Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) protocol on the number of user-reported usability issues is examined. To this end, 30 users were asked to use the National Cadastre and Mapping Agency web application and complete a set of tasks, such as measuring the land area of a square in their hometown. The order of tasks was randomized per participant. Next, participants were involved in RTA sessions. Each participant was involved in two different RTA modes: (a) the strict guidance, in which the facilitator stayed in the background and prompted participants to keep thinking aloud based on his judgement and experience, and (b) the physiology-supported interventions, in which the facilitator intervened based on real-time monitoring of user’s physiological signals. During each session, three participant’s physiological signals were recorded: skin conductance, skin temperature and blood volume pulse. Participants were also asked to provide valence-arousal ratings for each self-reported usability issue. Analysis of the collected data showed that participants in the physiology-supported RTA mode reported significantly more usability issues. No significant effect of the RTA mode was found on the valence-arousal ratings for the reported usability issues. Participants’ physiological signals during the RTA sessions did not also differ significantly between the two modes.

SP  - 295

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Given the rapid advancement of technologies in the automotive domain, driver--vehicle interaction has recently become more and more complicated. The amount of research applied to the vehicle cockpit is increasing, with the advent of (highly) automated driving, as the range of interaction that is possible in a driving vehicle expands. However, as opportunities increase, so does the number of challenges that automotive user experience designers and researchers will face. This chapter focuses on the instrumentation of sensing and displaying techniques and technologies to make better user experience while driving. In the driver--vehicle interaction loop, the vehicle can sense driver states, analyze, estimate, and model the data, and then display it through the appropriate channels for intervention purposes. To improve the interaction, a huge number of new/affordable sensing (EEG, fNIRS, IR imaging) and feedback (head-up displays, auditory feedback, tactile arrays, etc.) techniques have been introduced. However, little research has attempted to investigate this area in a systematic way. This chapter provides an overview of recent advances of input and output modalities to be used for timely, appropriate driver--vehicle interaction. After outlining relevant background, we provide information on the best-known practices for input and output modalities based on the exchange results from the workshop on practical experiences for measuring and modeling drivers and driver--vehicle interactions at AutomotiveUI 2015. This chapter can help answer research questions on how to instrument a driving simulator or realistic study to gather data and how to place interaction outputs to enable appropriate driver interactions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the drivers’ information needs in automated driving. Virtual reality and simulation techniques were used to simulate the automated driving in different scenarios, and drivers need to fill in the information needs assessment questionnaires after completing the task. In automated driving, the eye tracker recorded the fixation behavior. The experimental results showed that, regardless of whether drivers focused on automated driving system or not, it is necessary for the system to feedback some general information to the driver, such as vehicle-related information (such as the current speed, blind spots), road-related information (such as the surrounding traffic, condition around, etc.), the auxiliary system state (on or off) and the ability of the auxiliary system to process the current scene etc..

BT  - Augmented Cognition. Enhancing Cognition and Behavior in Complex Human Environments
SP  - 443
EP  - 460
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In current military operations, a team of human operators, often distributed across multiple locations, is required to manage even a single Unmanned Vehicle (UxV). For future multi-UxV control, effective dynamic task sharing strategies – the ability to quickly re-assign tasks and responsibilities between operators or between operators and autonomous systems - will vastly improve team coordination. However, for task hand-off to be executed effectively, the task assignee needs to be quickly brought up to speed with sufficient situation awareness to effectively handle their new tasking. We have implemented a system, called Computational Situation Awareness (CSA), that encodes the awareness maintenance process into the control station itself. CSA generates a computational “mental” model of an expert’s SA and maintains multi-level awareness of the mission and state of the unmanned systems. This allows the system to predict information requirements and drive cueing and other mitigations for individuals and across the team. By tracking user tasks and system state related to those tasks, CSA builds an understanding of the task’s progress thus enabling it to better determine what information the user needs to maintain task relevant SA without bogging them down. By encoding workload assessment and situation awareness into the operator control station itself, the control station becomes a partner with the operator (or team of operators) in making sense of the data. This enables it to manage task sharing and offloading and share information in terms that aids rather than distracts, thus improving each operator’s mission effectiveness.

BT  - Human Factors in Computing and Informatics
SP  - 831

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Dyslexia is a Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD) that affects an individual’s ability to process, store, and retrieve information. This consequently affects the educational development of children with dyslexia. Early diagnosis for people with dyslexia is important to assist them in the critical stages of learning. Research examining visual reading patterns in people with SpLDs has suggested that the readers’ eye movements reflect the information processing difficulties that they experience. Visual reading patterns can be analyzed for screening purposes; eye tracking technology plays an essential role in this aspect. Research suggest that cognitive processing in reading Arabic demands stronger visual spatial processing abilities related to the nature of the Arabic language. This paper describes a screening system for people with dyslexia based on reading patterns of Arabic scripts using eye-tracking technology. The system records visual reading patterns in reading and provides objective measures of visual attention for SpLD specialists and practitioners to gain insights into the information processing difficulties and for them to design remedial plans for the individual.

VL  - 60
IS  - 1
AB  - Eye movement plays an important role in face to face communication in that it conveys nonverbal information and emotional intent beyond speech. Being “a window to the mind”, the eye and its behavior are tightly coupled with human cognitive processes. In this paper, we proposed an Emotional Eye Movement Markup Language (EEMML) which is an emotional eye movement animation scripting tool that enables authors to describe and generate emotional eye movement in virtual agents. The language can describe eye movement parameters we derived from facial expression database as well as real-time eye movement data (pupil size, blink rate and saccade). EEMML provides the input for our eye movement generator system with one or more eye movement actions in sequence. The language is extensible, so that new rules can be quickly added. It is designed to plug into larger human-agent or agent-agent interaction systems. We present an evaluation in which subjects evaluated the EEMML and gave their feedback. The results indicate the validity of our approach.

AB  - With new technologies towards medical cyber-physical systems, such as networked head-mounted displays (HMDs) and eye trackers, new interaction opportunities arise for real-time interaction between cyber-physical systems and users. This leads to cyber-physicial environments in which the user has an active role to play inside the cyber-physical system. With our medical application in the context of a cancer screening programme, we are combining active speech based input, passive/active eye tracker user input, and HMD output (all devices are on-body and hands-free) in a convenient way for both the patient and the doctor inside such a medical cyber-physical system. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of our resulting Medical Multimodal Cyber-Physical Environment and focus on how situation awareness provided by the environmental sensors effectively leads to an augmented cognition application for the doctor.

TI  - Effect of Devanagari Font Type in Reading Comprehension: An Eye Tracking Study

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this world of digitization, screen reading has grown immensely due to the availability of affordable display devices. Most of the people prefer to read on display devices as compared to the print media. To make the reading experience of the reader pleasant and comfortable, the font designers strive hard to choose suitable typographical properties of the text such as font type, font size etc. Some of the researchers suggest that the typography of the text affects the reading performance of the readers to some extent. However, the research focusing on the effect of typography on the reading behavior of the readers is limited and it is hardly touched upon for the Indian scripts. Therefore, the proposed paper aims to find out the effect of Devanagari font type on the reading performance, especially reading comprehension of the readers. In addition to this, a method to reduce the error in the gaze estimation of the eye tracker is also proposed. In order to understand the reading behavior, an eye tracking experiment is performed on 14 participants asking them to read 22 pages, in 3 different font types, presented on the screen of the eye tracker. The performance of the readers is analyzed in terms of total reading time, comprehension score, number of fixations, fixation duration and number of regressions. Our results show that there is a significant difference in the fixation duration, a number of fixations and the comprehension score, when the same document is read in different font type. Thus, there is a scope for improvement in the reading comprehension, by changing the physical properties of the document without changing its content. These findings might be useful to understand the readers’ preference for the font and to design a proper font type for online reading.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Business process models are widely used in organizations by information systems analysts to represent complex business requirements and by business users to understand business operations and constraints. This understanding is extracted from graphical process models as well as business rules. Prior research advocated integrating business rules into business process models to improve the effectiveness of important organizational activities, such as developing shared understanding, effective communication, and process improvement. However, whether such integrated modeling can improve the understanding of business processes has not been empirically evaluated. In this paper, we report on an experiment that investigates the effect of linked rules, a specific rule integration approach, on business process model understanding. Our results indicate that linked rules are associated with better time efficiency in interpreting business operations, less mental effort, and partially associated with improved accuracy of understanding.

SP  - 839
EP  - 850
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - To find the genuineness of a human behavior/emotion is an important research topic in affective and human centered computing. This paper uses a feature level fusion technique of three peripheral physiological features from observers, namely pupillary response (PR), blood volume pulse (BVP), and galvanic skin response (GSR). The observers’ task is to distinguish between real and posed smiles when watching twenty smilers’ videos (half being real smiles and half are posed smiles). A number of temporal features are extracted from the recorded physiological signals after a few processing steps and fused before computing classification performance by k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) classifiers. Many factors can affect the results of smile classification, and depend upon the architecture of the classifiers. In this study, we varied the K values of KNN, the scaling factors of SVM, and the numbers of hidden nodes of NN with other parameters unchanged. Our final experimental results from a robust leave-one-everything-out process indicate that parameter tuning is a vital factor to find a high classification accuracy, and that feature level fusion can indicate when more parameter tuning is needed.

AB  - Online retail business has become an emerging market for almost all business owners. Online recommender systems provide better service to consumers during their decision making processes. In this study, a controlled lab experiment was conducted to assess the effect of recommendation timing (early, mid, and late) and recommendation source (expert reviews vs. consumer reviews) on online consumers’ interest and attention. Eye-tracking data was extracted from the experiment and analyzed. The results suggest that consumers show more interest in recommendation based on consumer reviews than expert reviews. Earlier recommendations do not receive greater attention than later recommendations.

AB  - We present our efforts on studying the effect of transliteration, on the human readability. We have tried to explore the effect by studying the changes in the eye-gaze patterns, which are recorded with an eye-tracker during experimentation. We have chosen Hindi and English languages, written in Devanagari and Latin scripts respectively. The participants of the experiments are subjected to transliterated words and asked to speak the word. During this, their eye movements are recorded. The eye-tracking data is later analyzed for eye-fixation trends. Quantitative analysis of fixation count and duration as well as visit count is performed over the areas of interest.

AB  - Drivers’ ability to perform the primary task of driving a vehicle and be able to handle the interference caused by the secondary tasks such as the use of cell phone is greatly influenced by their driving experience. In this study, thirty-eight drivers with different levels of driving experience were studied to evaluate their driving performance during simple versus complex driving tasks performed with and without cell phone. The driving performance was evaluated by studying the visual behavior of the drivers using eye-tracking systems, driving error, and subjective workload assessment tool. Results demonstrate that the novice drivers fixated more on the dashboard area (36.33%) than on the front and center view (14.33%). On the other hand, the experienced drivers fixated more on the front and center (39.5%) as compared to the dashboard area (12%). Same trend was observed for complex driving but with lower percentage of total fixations than the simple driving conditions. The visual distraction caused by secondary task of cell phone use contributes to the decline in driving performance. Although all drivers reported higher workloads during driving while using cell phones and committed more driving errors, the errors were comparatively lower for experienced drivers than the inexperienced drivers.

AB  - Computer-generated animations of American Sign Language (ASL) can improve the accessibility of information, communication, and services for the significant number of deaf adults in the US with difficulty in reading English text. Unfortunately, there are several linguistic aspects of ASL that current automatic generation or translation systems cannot produce (or are time-consuming for human animators to create). To determine how important such phenomena are to user satisfaction and the comprehension of ASL animations, studies were conducted in which native ASL signers evaluated ASL animations with and without: establishment of spatial reference points around the virtual human signer representing entities under discussion, pointing pronoun signs, contrastive role shift, and spatial inflection of ASL verbs. It was found that adding these phenomena to ASL animations led to a significant improvement in user comprehension of the animations, thereby motivating future research on automating the generation of these animations.

AB  - Through the analysis of major fatal accidents occurred within 30 years from 1986 to 2016 in China’s coal mines, it reflects that human errors accounting for up to 80% of the total accidents. The coal mines have set up a variety of safety signs that can alert miners to be careful with the insecurity in the workplace, and guide them to behave safely in accordance with legal standards. However, the human-induced accidents still occur. The problem is that although the safety signs have been adopted universally in the coal mines as a kind of management strategy, they are hard to play the safety signs’ due role in the practical application. The low effectiveness of safety signs is one of the important reasons for the coal mines accidents. In order to settle the practical problems and improve the safety level of coal mines, this research is designed to study the effectiveness of safety signs in coal mines.

SP  - 85

PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - In face-to-face conversations, speakers monitor the listener’s gaze to check whether the listener is engaged in the conversation. The speaker may change the conversational strategy if the listener is not fully engaged in the conversation. In this chapter, we propose an algorithm to estimate the user’s conversational engagement based on various types of gaze information, such as gaze shift patterns, gaze duration, amount of eye movement, and pupil size. By applying the proposed algorithm, we implement an agent that can change its conversational strategy according to the user’s conversational engagement. We also evaluate the agent system by investigating how the agent’s awareness of the user’s engagement affects the user’s verbal and nonverbal behaviors as well as the subjective impressions of the agent. First, based on an empirical study, we identify useful information for estimating user engagement, and establish an engagement estimation model using a decision tree technique. The model can predict the user’s disengagement with an accuracy of over 70 %. Then, the model is implemented as a real-time engagement-judgment mechanism and is incorporated into a multimodal dialogue manager in a conversational agent. Finally, our evaluation experiment reveals that probing questions by the engagement-sensitive agent successfully recover the subject’s conversational engagement, change the gaze behaviors of the subject, and elicit more verbal contribution. Moreover, such timely probing questions also improve the subject’s impression of the agent.

AB  - Organisation-based recommender interfaces (ORGs) have drawn attention from both the academia and the industry as they allow users to determine their preferences for product attributes. Considering that users’ personality traits may deeply influence their shopping behaviour, we performed an eye-tracking lab experiment to compare two types of recommender interfaces, namely the classified evaluation ORG and the non-classified evaluation list. The results showed that highly conscientious users paid significantly more attention to ORG, evaluated slightly more products, and placed more fixations on each product in the ORG. Whereas, low conscientiousness users exhibited more fixations on the LIST interface. Hence, the empirical findings suggest that users with different personalities adapted their visual searching behaviour to the change in the recommendation presentation.

AB  - Previous work is reviewed and an experiment described to examine the spatial and strategic cognitive factors impacting on human orientation in the ‘drop-off’ static orientation scenario, where a person is matching a scene to a map to establish directional correspondence. The relative roles of salient landmarks and scene content and geometry, including space syntax isovist measures, are explored both in terms of general effects, individual differences between participant strategies, and the apparent cognitive processes involved. In general people tend to be distracted by salient 3D landmarks even when they know these will not be detectable on the map, but benefit from a salient 2D landmark whose geometry is present in both images. However, cluster analysis demonstrated clear variations in strategy and in the relative roles of the geometry and content of the scene. Results are discussed in the context of improving future geographic information content.

AB  - People with dyslexia have reported difficulties with navigating websites, yet very little research has investigated the nature of these difficulties. This study investigated the effects of two aspects of web navigation, menu organization and visibility on the eye gaze behaviour, performance and preferences of dyslexic and non-dyslexic participants. Participants undertook four tasks on a website with either unified or fragmented main menu organization and either static or dynamic submenus. Dyslexic participants had significantly longer menu scanpaths (i.e. looked at more menu items), due to looking at more different menu items and revisiting more items in comparison to non-dyslexic participants. They also had more fixations and longer dwell times on submenus than non-dyslexic participants. They were also slower to select their first menu item and complete tasks. However, the perceptions of the different menu presentations did not differ between the two participant groups, although all participants preferred the unified menu presentation to the fragmented. Directions for further research to deepen the understanding and implications of these results are discussed.

Two arrays of dots were displayed in sequence within a grid. Between the two arrays, one cell was always empty, and the participants’ task was to specify the location of this “missing dot” It was found that the accuracy decreased as dot pattern of array 1 increased in complexity, especially under long ISI condition. The analysis of eye movement behavior, especially fixation location, demonstrated that participants were more likely to try to remember the location of the empty cells of array 1 other than locations of dots. From aspect of eye movement, these results offered the first evidence supporting convert-and-compare hypothesis.

An enormous amount of effort is devoted to finding ways to visualize information so that humans can understand and make sense of it. By studying how professionals engage in these visual search tasks, we can develop insights into their cognitive processes and the influence of experience on those processes. This can advance our understanding of visual cognition in addition to providing information that can be applied to designing improved data visualizations or training new analysts.

AB  - The design of user interfaces plays an important role in human computer interaction, especially for smartphones and tablet devices. It is very important to consider the interface design of smartphones for elderly people in order for them to benefit from the variety applications on such devices. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of user age as well as screen size on smartphone/tablet use. We evaluated the usability of smartphone interfaces for three different age groups: elderly age group (60+ years), middle age group (40-59 years) and younger age group (20-39 years). The evaluation is performed using three different screen sizes of smartphone and tablet devices: 3.2”, 7”, and 10.1” respectively. An eye-tracker device was employed to obtain three metrics: fixation duration, scan-path duration, and saccades amplitude. Two hypothesis were considered. First, elderly users will have both local and global processing diffieculties on smartphone/tablet use than other age groups. Second, all user age groups will be influnced by screen sizes; small screen size will have smaller saccades proportion indicating uneasy interface broswing compared to large screen size. All these results have been statistically evaluated using 2-way ANOVA.

AB  - Eye typing provides a means of communication that is especially useful for people with disabilities. However, most related research addresses technical issues in eye typing systems, and largely ignores design issues. This paper reports experiments studying the impact of auditory and visual feedback on user performance and experience. Results show that feedback impacts typing speed, accuracy, gaze behavior, and subjective experience. Also, the feedback should be matched with the dwell time. Short dwell times require simplified feedback to support the typing rhythm, whereas long dwell times allow extra information on the eye typing process. Both short and long dwell times benefit from combined visual and auditory feedback. Six guidelines for designing feedback for gaze-based text entry are provided.

AB  - Over the last years the number and quality of information and entertainment systems in automobiles has been rising constantly. This presents the challenge to provide safe and user-friendly interaction techniques, the implementation of which can lead to a higher level of efficiency, safety and user experience. One novel and promising approach is to use the drivers gaze as input for interaction with infotainment systems. We implemented a virtual car interior model to test the efficiency and user experience of gaze interaction with automotive infotainment systems. In a user study with 20 participants we compared a gaze-based interaction style to a haptic interaction technique. The usability of both techniques turned out to be very similar, while the user experience and the efficiency varied in parts. We used an eye-tracking device to investigate gaze behavior, but due to some technical problems with the device our quantitative findings are not as reliable and robust as we would have hoped for and have to be interpreted with care. Our qualitative data indicated a preference for gaze interaction.

AB  - Recent automated medical image analysis methods have attained state-of-the-art performance but have relied on memory and compute-intensive deep learning models. Reducing model size without significant loss in performance metrics is crucial for time and memory-efficient automated image-based decision-making. Traditional deep learning based image analysis only uses expert knowledge in the form of manual annotations. Recently, there has been interest in introducing other forms of expert knowledge into deep learning architecture design. This is the approach considered in the paper where we propose to combine ultrasound video with point-of-gaze tracked for expert sonographers as they scan to train memory-efficient ultrasound image analysis models. Specifically we develop teacher-student knowledge transfer models for the exemplar task of frame classification for the fetal abdomen, head, and femur. The best performing memory-efficient models attain performance within 5% of conventional models that are $$1000{\times }$$larger in size.

AB  - Elderly people face problems when using current forms of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Developing novel and natural methods of interaction would facilitate resolving some of those issues. We propose that HCI can be improved by combining communication modalities, in particular, speech and gaze, in various ways. This study presents elderly speech-gaze interaction as a novel method in HCI, a review of literature for its potential of use, and discusses possible domains of application for further empirical investigations.

AB  - If children could be enticed to pay more attention to the print area, it could help increase their print awareness and future reading ability. Along with the development of electronic technology, many books have changed to the electronic format, and storybooks are no exception. The purpose of this study was to understand which electronic storybook display method is best able to increase children’s attention to the print area. To this end, we modified the electronic storybook’s design and used an eye-tracker to measure children’s visual attention during reading. The study included 76 children between the ages of 4–6 from two northern Taiwanese kindergartens. The kindergarteners were split into three groups: a traditional storybook group, the highlight synchronization group (implicit instruction), and the text-discussion group (explicit instruction). This study was conducted over a 6-week period: one week for pre-tests, four weeks of interventions, and one week for post-tests. The result of pre-test suggested that the northern Taiwanese children spent about 80% of their time looking at the picture area, and about 20% at the print area. The result of week 2, the first week of the intervention stage, showed that, when it came to visual attention invested in the print area, the highlight synchronization groups paid significantly more attention to the print area than the traditional storybook group.

EP  - 90
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Most cognitive studies of language acquisition in both natural systems and artificial systems have focused on the role of purely linguistic information as the central constraint. However, we argue that non-linguistic information, such as vision and talkers’ attention, also plays a major role in language acquisition. To support this argument, this chapter reports two studies of embodied language learning – one on natural intelligence and one on artificial intelligence. First, we developed a novel method that seeks to describe the visual learning environment from a young child’s point of view. A multi-camera sensing environment is built which consists of two head-mounted mini cameras that are placed on both the child’s and the parent’s foreheads respectively. The major result is that the child uses their body to constrain the visual information s/he perceives and by doing so adapts to an embodied solution to deal with the reference uncertainty problem in language learning. In our second study, we developed a learning system trained in an unsupervised mode in which users perform everyday tasks while providing natural language descriptions of their behaviors. The system collects acoustic signals in concert with user-centric multisensory information from non-speech modalities, such as user’s perspective video, gaze positions, head directions and hand movements. A multimodal learning algorithm uses this data to first spot words from continuous speech and then associate action verbs and object names with their perceptually grounded meanings. Similar to human learners, the central ideas of our computational system are to make use of non-speech contextual information to facilitate word spotting, and utilize body movements as deictic references to associate temporally co-occurring data from different modalities and build a visually grounded lexicon.

AB  - This chapter describes embodied interaction as a stance towards interaction design for games. It aims at informing game developers with bridging concepts between gameplay and different interaction paradigms that incorporate and focus on the human body (i.e., body-based, natural and tangible interaction). It highlights challenges, potentials and pitfalls of physical interactions and discusses the role of the human mind-body relation as a fundamental concept towards serious game interaction design. This chapter underlines embodied interaction in play as a promising perspective for game developers, that puts emphasize on the notion of humans as social and physical creatures with sentient bodies and highlights the relevance of this perspective for serious game interaction design as well as research in the field. One of the main challenges for researchers in this field will be to create meaningful interactions that internalize these concepts as integral parts of how serious games achieve their impact.

AB  - Many body parts, personal characteristics and signaling methods have recently been suggested and used for biometrics systems: fingers, hands, feet, faces, eyes, ears, teeth, veins, voices, signatures, typing styles and gaits. A continuously increasing number of biometric techniques have risen in order to fulfill the different kinds of demands in the market. Every method presents a number of advantages compared to the others as each technique has been created to subserve different kinds of requirements. However, there is still no method able to completely satisfy the current security needs. This is the reason why researchers continuously drive their efforts to newer methods that will provide a higher security stage. In this paper, the emerging biometric modalities are presented.

VL  - 19
IS  - 2
AB  - We introduce EmoSnaps, a mobile application that captures unobtrusively pictures of one’s facial expressions throughout the day and uses them for later recall of her momentary emotions. We describe two field studies that employ EmoSnaps in an attempt to investigate if and how individuals and their relevant others infer emotions from self-face and familiar face pictures, respectively. Study 1 contrasted users’ recalled emotions as inferred from EmoSnaps’ self-face pictures to ground truth data as derived from Experience Sampling. Contrary to our expectations, we found that people are better able to infer their past emotions from a self-face picture the longer the time has elapsed since capture. Study 2 assessed EmoSnaps’ ability to capture users’ experiences while interacting with different mobile apps. The study revealed systematic variations in users’ emotions while interacting with different categories of mobile apps (such as productivity and entertainment), social networking services, as well as direct social communications through phone calls and instant messaging, but also diurnal and weekly patterns of happiness as inferred from EmoSnaps’ self-face pictures. All in all, the results of both studies provided us with confidence over the validity of self-face pictures captured through EmoSnaps as memory cues for emotion recall, and the effectiveness of the EmoSnaps tool in measuring users’ momentary experiences.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this paper, we proposed EREGE system, EREGE system considers as a face analysis package including face detection, eye detection, eye tracking, emotion recognition, and gaze estimation. EREGE system consists of two parts; facial emotion recognition that recognizes seven emotions such as neutral, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. In the emotion recognition part, we have implemented an Active Shape Model (ASM) tracker which tracks 116 facial landmarks via webcam input. The tracked landmark points are used to extract face expression features. A support Vector machine (SVM) based classifier is implemented which gives rise to robust our system by recognizing seven emotions. The second part of EREGE system is the eye gaze estimation that starts by creating the head model followed by presenting both Active Shape Model (ASM) and Pose from Orthography and Scaling with Iterations (POSIT) algorithms for head tracking and position estimation.

AB  - Alzheimer Disease (AD) early detection is considered of high importance for improving the quality of life of patients and their families. Amongst all the different approaches for AD detection, significant work has been focused on emotion analysis through facial expressions, body language or speech. Many studies also use the electroencephalogram in order to capture emotions that patients cannot physically express. Our work introduces an emotion recognition approach using facial expression and EEG signal analysis. A novel dataset was created specifically to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD patients. This work uses novel EEG features based on quaternions, facial landmarks and the combination of them. Their performance was evaluated in a comparative study with a state of the art methods that demonstrates the proposed approach.

AB  - Web pages are the main interface of human-computer interaction on the Internet. Although several factors of successful Web page design have been studied, few researches considered the utility and effectiveness of emotion and rationality in Web information for e-Commerce. This study conducted an eye-tracking experiment to address how emotional and rational appeals mediate the users’ Web commercial information perceiving, as reflected by their own eye movements. The major finding is that the mean fixation duration for participants to obtain information appealed in emotional strategy is significant shorter than those appealed in rational strategy. The result may indicate that Web commercial information in rational strategy is more difficult to be extracted, and therefore suffers from more cognitive processes.

AB  - We present results from two experiments intended to allow naturalistic data collection of the physiological effects of cognitive load. Considering the example of command and control environments, we identify shortcomings of previous studies which use either laboratory-based scenarios, lacking realism, or real-world scenarios, lacking repeatability. We identify the hybrid approach of remote-control which allows experimental subjects to remain in a laboratory setting, performing a real-world task in a completely controlled environment. We show that emotional investment is vital for evoking natural responses and that physiological indications of cognitive load manifest themselves more readily in our hybrid experimental setup. Finally, we present a set of experimental design recommendations for naturalistic data collection.

AB  - Emotions detection and their management are key issues to provide personalize support in educational scenarios. Literature suggests that combining several input sources can improve the performance of affect recognition. To gain a better understanding of this issue, we carried out a large scale experiment in our laboratory where about 100 participants performed several mathematical exercises while emotional information was gathered from different input sources, including a written emotional report. As a first step, we have explored emotions detection from traditional methods by combining analysis of user behavior when typing this report with sentiment analysis on the text. Moreover, an expert labeled these reports. All these data were used to feed several machine learning algorithms to infer user’s emotions. Preliminary results are not conclusive, but lead some light on how to proceed with the analysis.

VL  - 28
IS  - 4
AB  - For geographical mobile search tasks it is rarely sufficient to assist users identifying what location they are currently looking for, e.g. a store, cafe or museum. Often the user needs support in being guided to a retrieved location in a physical space. This means that mobile search is strongly connected with navigation. There is a large body of work indicating that navigating towards points of interest is challenging for many people. In this work we explore how to support best this part of the task by investigating how objects in the physical world—landmarks—can be used in information systems to guide people to their desired location. We present the results of a series of eye tracking studies on the orientation behavior of persons executing indoor navigation tasks. The main finding of the studies is that the contextual relevance and the function of a landmark for completing the task efficiently matters more than the context-free salience of the same landmark. The findings have implications for the design of mobile search systems that support geographical search tasks as they lead to new context-adaptive strategies for navigation systems to explain routes. We provide evidence that even the interface has to adapt its content on the state of the navigation task and the current spatial context in order to provide user- and context-adaptive intuitive interaction.

PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - The past few years have seen tremendous development in web technologies. A range of websites and mobile applications have been developed to support a variety of online activities. The ubiquitous nature and increasing complexity of technology mean that ensuring accessibility remains challenging. Accessibility evaluation refers to the process of examining a product and establishing the extent to which it supports accessibility through the identification of potential barriers. While accessibility guidelines can guide the development process and automated evaluation tools can assist in measuring conformance, they do not guarantee that products will be accessible in a live context. The most reliable way to evaluate the accessibility of a product is to conduct a study with representative users interacting with the product. This chapter outlines a range of methods which can be used to ensure that a product is designed to meet the requirements and specific needs of users, from the ideation phase to the design and iterative development. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are described, as well as the primary considerations to ensure that the results of a study are reliable and valid, and also participants are treated ethically. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the field as well as an examination of future trends such as how data from user studies can be used to influence the design of future accessibility guidelines to improve their efficacy.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose an “oblique” listening system in the English language for the blind and visually impaired by controlling the speed of Text-to-Speech based on parts of speech in which the important parts are synthesized ’relatively’ slower while the unimportant at the maximum speed. In the system evaluation experiment, English natives with vision impairments were required to listen to three short passages of Text-to-Speech at the three types of speed and answer the questions of comprehension after the base-line speed was calculated from the measured maximum speed of recognizing ’a word’ and that of recognizing ’a sentence’ for each subject. We controlled the Text-to-Speech speed: base-line, ’oblique listening’ speed, and simple high speed, by which the duration is equal to the one by our system but without any speed variation. The results show that the “oblique” listening system is better than a simple high speed system even though not exceeding the base-line.

AB  - We explore the feasibility of Tacit Secrets: system-assigned passwords that you can remember, but cannot write down or otherwise communicate. We design an approach to creating Tacit Secrets based on contextual cueing, an implicit learning method previously studied in the cognitive psychology literature. Our feasibility study indicates that our approach has strong security properties: resistance to brute-force attacks, online attacks, phishing attacks, some coercion attacks, and targeted impersonation attacks. It also offers protection against leaks from other verifiers as the secrets are system-assigned. Our approach also has some interesting usability properties, a high login success rate, and low false positive rates. We explore enhancements to our approach and find that incorporating eye-tracking data offers substantial improvements. We also explore the trade-offs of different configurations of our design and provide insight into valuable directions for future work.

The aim was to modify the visual quality of the application in order to make it simple and visually more easy to understand, which consequently leads to improved user experience. The process of enhancement of user interface of the web application home page and subsequent web pages is based on different methods for establishing clear visual hierarchy of presented information, among them the methods of reduction, regularization and leverage. The web application to which the above principles were applied is Open Platform for Clinical Nutrition, which offers to users effective means for identifying their nutritional state and adjusting diet plans to their way of life and clinical state. Currently, the application has about 3000 active users.

AB  - We present and discuss the results of two empirical studies that aim at assessing the contributions, to the effectiveness and efficiency of online help of: adaptive-proactive user support (APH), multimodal (speech and graphics) messages (MH), and embodied conversational agents (ECAs). These three enhancements to online help were implemented using the Wizard of Oz technique. The first study (E1) compares MH with APH, while the second study (E2) compares MH with embodied help (EH). Half of the participants in E1 (8) used MH, and the other half used APH. Most participants who used MH, resp. APH, preferred MH, resp. APH, to standard help systems which implement text and graphics messages (like APH). In particular, proactive assistance was much appreciated. However, higher performances were achieved with MH. A majority of the 22 participants in E2 preferred EH to MH, and were of the opinion that the presence of an ECA, a talking head in this particular case, has the potential to improve help effectiveness and efficiency by increasing novice users’ self confidence. However, performances with the two systems were similar, save for help consultation rate which was higher with EH. Longitudinal (usage) studies are needed to confirm the effects of these three enhancements on novice users’ judgments and performances.

BT  - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics

CY  - Cham
AB  - Many research papers investigate the benefits to a pilot of eye tracking (ET) in training [1, 2]. None however, explore the efficacy of ET training from an instructor’s perspective, specifically relating to trainee checking, scanning and monitoring. Using a questionnaire of both numerical rating and open answers, 19 experienced A330 instructors answered questions on simulator profiles that they observed on an operational simulator A330 De-Brief Facility (DBF). The profiles were played first without and then with ET data run in parallel. This research interrogated the ease with which instructors were able to interpret the data, investigated their ability to spot checking and scanning errors and challenged their pre-conceptions over how many errors they were able to identify. Results showed that considerable numbers of checking and scanning errors were missed and that with the augmentation of ET, error identification significantly increases. It was shown that instructors were not as error aware as they thought; moreover, prior to the addition of ET, instructors’ focus was not on scanning and checking errors, despite the error presence.

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the use of neurophysiologic synchronies as a measurement of team cognition (1) in a military-style virtual environment simulation. Neurophysiologic synchronies (NS), defined as the second-by-second quantitative co-expression of the levels of cognitive measures by individual members of a team (8), were found to be useful in monitoring the quality of teamwork and to be a means to identify more optimal patterns of team interaction which can be used to provide feedback during training. In the current study, findings showed promise for further research in the collection of NS. A framework is also proposed to support the research and training of team cognition.

JO  - Information Retrieval Journal
SP  - 53
EP  - 80
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - User interactions in Web search, in particular, clicks, provide valuable hints on document relevance; but the signals are very noisy. In order to better understand user click behaviors and to infer the implied relevance, various click models have been proposed, each relying on some hypotheses and involving different hidden events (e.g. examination).In almost all the existing click models, it is assumed that clicks are the only observable evidence and the examinations of documents are deduced from it. However, with an increasing number of embedded heterogeneous components (e.g. verticals) on Search Engine Result Pages, click information is not sufficient to draw a complete picture of process of user examination, especially in federated search scenario. In practice, we can also collect mouse movement information, which has proven to have a strong correlation with examination. In this paper, we propose to incorporate mouse movement information into existing click models to enhance the estimation of examination. The enhanced click models are shown to have a better ability to predict both user clicks and document relevance, than the original models. The collection of mouse movement information has been implemented in a commercial search engine, showing the feasibility of the approach in practice.

AB  - The book presented an approach to leveraging cognitive features for NLP by harnessing eye-movement information from human readers and annotators. Eye-tracking technology is primarily used to record and analyze shallow cognitive information during text reading and annotation, to achieve the following goals: (a) better assessment of annotation effort to (a) increase annotation efficiency and (b) rationalize annotation pricing, and (b) augmenting text-based features with Cognition-Driven Features. The efficacy of the approaches has been exemplified by translation, sentiment analysis, and sarcasm detection tasks.

VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - A great deal of real-world data have graph structures, and such structures are often visualized into node-link diagrams for a better understanding of the data. Aesthetic criteria have been used as quality measures to evaluate the effectiveness of graph visualizations in conveying the embedded information to end users. However, commonly applied aesthetics are originally proposed based on common senses and personal intuitions; thus, their relevance to effectiveness is not guaranteed. It has been agreed that aesthetics should be established based on empirical evidence and derived from theories of how people read graphs. As the first step to this end, we have conducted two eye tracking studies in an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism of edge crossings, the most discussed aesthetic, affecting human graph reading performance. These studies lead to the findings of an important aesthetic of crossing angles and a graph reading behavior of geodesic path tendency. We demonstrate that eye tracking is an effective method for gaining insights into how people read graphs and that how aesthetics can be established based on human graph reading behavior.

AB  - The objective of this chapter is to provide practical recommendations on how to establish and operate a NeuroIS lab. Drawing on the experience of the authors, we provide recommendations on the setting of the experimental rooms, measurement equipment, software, and consumables. Moreover, we suggest sources of information where IS researchers could learn about neurophysiological measurement instruments and establish contacts with vendors of such instruments. Also, we provide practical advice on how to efficiently operate a NeuroIS lab. Illustrations from the Tech3Lab, HEC Montréal, are used to outline the specificity of a NeuroIS lab. We emphasize that the type of lab we discuss in this chapter is one with neurophysiological measurement instruments, and hence we do not focus on labs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or similar technologies.

AB  - The basic requirement of supervised data-driven methods for various NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, machine translation is large-scale annotated data. Since statistical methods have taken places overrule/heuristic methods over the years, text annotation has become an essential NLP research. Annotation refers to the task of manually labeling of text, image, or other data with comments, explanation, tags or markups—for NLP, often carried out by linguists to label raw text. While the outcome of the annotation process, i.e., the labeled data is valuable, capturing user activities may help in understanding the cognitive subprocesses underlying text annotation.

EP  - 274
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Click-through information has been regarded as one of the most important signals for implicit relevance feedback in Web search engines. Because large variation exists in users’ personal characteristics, such as search expertise, domain knowledge, and carefulness, different user clicks should not be treated as equally important. Different from most existing works that try to estimate the credibility of user clicks based on click-through or querying behavior, we propose to enrich the credibility estimation framework with mouse movement and eye-tracking information. In the proposed framework, the credibility of user clicks is evaluated with a number of metrics in which a user in the context of a certain search session is treated as a relevant document classifier. With an experimental search engine system that collects click-through, mouse movement, and eye movement data simultaneously, we find that credible user behaviors could be separated from non-credible ones with a number of interaction behavior features. Further experimental results indicate that relevance prediction performance could be improved with the proposed estimation framework.

Some studies show that physical actions captured by a device can be indicators of a user’s interest. We introduce the ongoing pilot study’s results, which show the possible relationship between a user’s face approaching the screen, as captured by a webcam, and their interest in the document on the screen. Our system uses a common user-friendly device. We evaluate our prototype system from the viewpoint of presuming an interest from such a face approach and the practicality of the system, and discuss the future possibilities of our research.

AB  - Studying gaze direction is useful for the completion of visual tasks. It is well known that the visual gaze is a product of two contributing factors: head pose and eye location. In general, the visual gaze can be determined from head pose when standing at some distance from the visual target [76]. Starting from this general statement, the present chapter will first detail the human visual system and the steps that are necessary to generate the gaze. An account of the completed works on gaze tracking will then be presented along with selected techniques according to the different types of systems (intrusive or non-intrusive). A few applications will beintroduced afterwards to illustrate how data collected from the gaze are processed. Finally, we will examine how the head pose contributes to visual gaze estimation, and also how to estimate the gaze based on eye position only.

SP  - 743

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Operating heavy vehicles, for instance an excavator, requires a high level of attention to the operation done using the vehicle and awareness of the surroundings. Digital transformation in heavy vehicles aims to improve productivity and user experience, but it can also increase the operators mental load because of a higher demand of attention to instrumentation and controls, subsequently leading to reduced situation awareness. One way to mitigate this, is to display information within the operators’ field of view, which enhances information detectability through quick glances, using mixed reality interfaces. This work explores two types of mixed reality visualizations and compares them to a traditional display setup in a simulated excavator environment. We have utilized eye-tracking glasses to study users’ attention to the task, surrounding awareness, and interfaces, followed by a NASA-RTLX questionnaire to evaluate the users’ reported mental workload. The results indicate benefits for the mixed reality approaches, with lower workload ratings together with an improved rate in detection of presented information.

AB  - Information hidden in the eye movement signal can be a valuable source of knowledge about a human mind. This information is commonly used in multiple fields of interests like psychology, medicine, business, advertising, or even software developing. The proper analysis of the eye movement signal requires its elements to be extracted. The most important ones are fixations—moments when eyes are almost stable and the brain is acquiring information about the scene. There were several algorithms, aiming at detecting fixations, developed. The studies presented in this paper focused one of the most common dispersion-based algorithms—I-DT one. The various ways of evaluating its results were analyzed and compared. Some extensions in this algorithm were made as well.

AB  - In many areas of non-photorealistic and illustrative rendering, considerable progress has been made toward synthesizing traditional artistic and illustrative techniques. However, evaluation and validation of such images have only been attempted relatively recently. This chapter surveys evaluation approaches that have been applied successfully in non-photorealistic and illustrative rendering. It provides an overview over different evaluation approaches including qualitative and quantitative techniques and gives examples for how to approach evaluation in the NPR context. Collectively, the described techniques do not only answer the question of whether an NPR technique is able to replicate a traditional technique successfully but also what implications the use of NPR techniques has and what opinion people have about different NPR techniques as compared to traditional depictions.

The simulator can predict possible interaction patterns when undertaking a task using a variety of input devices and estimate the time to complete the task in the presence of different disabilities. This paper presents a study to evaluate the simulator by considering a representative application of searching icons, which was being used by able-bodied, visually impaired and mobility-impaired people. The simulator predicted task completion times for all three groups with statistically significant accuracy. The simulator also predicted the effects of different interface designs on task completion time accurately. The simulator is used to develop inclusive digital TV interfaces. A case study is presented to investigate accessibility requirements of a representative digital TV interface.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose an empirical, perception-based evaluation approach for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of longstanding cartographic design principles applied to 2D map displays. The approach includes bottom-up visual saliency models that are compared with eye-movement data collected in human-subject experiments on map stimuli embedded in the so-called flicker paradigm. The proposed methods are applied to the assessment of four commonly used visual variables for designing 2D maps: size, color value, color hue, and orientation. The empirical results suggest that the visual variable size is the most efficient (fastest) and most effective (accurate) visual variable to detect change under flicker conditions. The visual variable orientation proved to be the least efficient and effective of the tested visual variables. These empirical results shed new light on the implied ranking of the visual variables that have been proposed over 40 years ago. With the presented approach we hope to provide cartographers, GIScientists and visualization designers a systematic assessment method to develop effective and efficient geovisualization displays.

AB  - [Context and Motivation:] In current practice, existing traceability data is often underutilized due to lack of accessibility and difficulties users have in constructing the complex SQL queries needed to address realistic Software Engineering questions. In our prior work we therefore presented TiQi – a natural language (NL) interface for querying software projects. TiQi has been shown to transform a set of trace queries collected from IT experts at accuracy rates ranging from 47 % to 93 %. [Question/problem:] However, users need to quickly determine whether TiQi has correctly understood the NL query. [Principal ideas/results:] TiQi needs to communicate the transformed query back to the user and provide support for disambiguation and correction. In this paper we report on three studies we conducted to compare the effectiveness of four query representation techniques. [Contribution:] We show that simultaneously displaying a visual query representation, SQL, and a sample of the data results enabled users to most accurately evaluate the correctness of the transformed query.

AB  - The EcoKnow project strives to promote flexible case management systems in the public administration and empower end-users (i.e., case workers) to make sense of digitized models of the law. For this, a hybrid representation combining the declarative DCR notation with textual annotations depicting the law text and a simulation tool to simulate the execution of single process instances was proposed. This hybrid representation aims to overcome the notorious limitations of existing declarative notations in term of understandability. Using eye tracking, this paper investigates how users engage with the different artifacts of the hybrid representation.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of design pattern and anti-pattern dependencies on changes and faults
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 896
EP  - 931
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
AB  - On the one hand, design patterns are solutions to recurring design problems, aimed at increasing reuse, flexibility, and maintainability. However, much prior work found that some patterns, such as the Observer and Singleton, are correlated with large code structures and argued that they are more likely to be fault prone. On the other hand, anti-patterns describe poor solutions to design and implementation problems that highlight weaknesses in the design of software systems and that may slow down maintenance and increase the risk of faults. They have been found to negatively impact change and fault-proneness. Classes participating in design patterns and anti-patterns have dependencies with other classes, e.g., static and co-change dependencies, that may propagate problems to other classes. We investigate the impact of such dependencies in object-oriented systems by studying the relations between the presence of static and co-change dependencies and (1) the fault-proneness, (2) the types of changes, and (3) the types of faults that these classes exhibit. We analyze six design patterns and 10 anti-patterns in 39 releases of ArgoUML, JFreeChart, and XercesJ, and investigate to what extent classes having dependencies with design patterns or anti-patterns have higher odds of faults than other classes. We show that in almost all releases of the three systems, classes having dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone than others while this is not always true for classes with dependencies with design patterns. We also observe that structural changes are the most common changes impacting classes having dependencies with anti-patterns. Software developers could use this knowledge about the impact of design pattern and anti-pattern dependencies to better focus their testing and reviewing activities towards the most risky classes and to propagate changes adequately.

JO  - Personal and Ubiquitous Computing
SP  - 781
EP  - 801
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
AB  - New and emerging multi-screen television scenarios and applications need new evaluation procedures, methodologies, and tools to support multi-screen data analysis. In this work, we introduce a set of 12 measures to characterize viewers’ visual attention patterns for multi-screen TV. Out of these, eight measures are computed directly from eye-tracking data, while the other four are evaluated using questionnaires. We applied our measures during a controlled experiment involving nine distinct screen layouts with two, three, and four TV screens, for which we report new findings about viewers’ distributions of visual attention. For example, we found that viewers need an average discovery time up to 4.5 s to visually fixate four screens, and their subjective perceptions of what they watched and for how long they watched each screen are substantially accurate, i.e., we report Pearson’s correlation coefficients up to r = .892 with ground truth measured with eye-tracking equipment. We also analyze and discuss the evolution of our participants’ distributions of visual attention over time from the perspective of our new set of measures. For example, we found that people perform significantly more transitions between screens during the first seconds of watching television, after which their level of visual attention converges to a stable value. We complement the findings revealed by our objective eye gaze measurements with subjective data about participants’ perceived cognitive work load and comfortability while watching more than one TV screen, and we measure viewers’ capacities to understand and recall content delivered simultaneously on multiple screens. To foster new studies and explorations of viewers’ visual attention patterns during multi-screen television watching, we release in the community an update for an existing software toolkit (i.e., VATic-TV, the Visual Attention Toolkit for TV, now at version v2) that automatically computes our measures from data delivered by standard eye-tracking equipment. We hope that our new set of measures and the companion software will benefit the community as a first step toward understanding visual attention for emerging multi-screen TV applications and, consequently, will help researchers and practitioners to design new TV applications that will better exploit viewers’ visual attention patterns toward new, richer television experiences.

AB  - Previous research has identified broad metric classes for human-automation performance in order to facilitate metric selection, as well as understanding and comparing research results. However, there is still a lack of a systematic method for selecting the most efficient set of metrics when designing evaluation experiments. This chapter identifies and presents a list of evaluation criteria that can help determine the quality of a metric in terms of experimental constraints, comprehensive understanding, construct validity, statistical efficiency, and measurement technique efficiency. Based on the evaluation criteria, a comprehensive list of potential metric costs and benefits is generated. The evaluation criteria, along with the list of metric costs and benefits, and the existing generic metric classes provide a foundation for the development of a cost-benefit analysis approach that can be used for metric selection.

AB  - Texts embedded in video streams convey crucial information for documentation. Many text detection and recognition systems have been designed to automatically extract such documentary data from video streams. Most of the research teams involved argue that commercial OCR do not work properly on images extracted from a video stream. They thus concieve their own detection systems. Nevertheless, commercial OCR have never been evaluated on such corpora. This article details a new methodology to evaluate a commercial OCR on a video document. This methodology is goal directed: the system is penalized proportionally to TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) scores of texts [1]. We experiment our methodology on Abbyy FineReader 6.0.

TI  - Evaluation of Diagnostic Rules for Real-Time Assessment of Mental Workload Within a Dynamic Adaptation Framework
BT  - Adaptive Instructional Systems
SP  - 391
EP  - 404
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) aim to support the learner by dynamically providing feedback tailored to the individual learner’s needs. To select the appropriate type and level of support, the adaptive system gathers on-task information on learner performance and the learner’s current mental state. The Real-Time Assessment of Multidimensional User State (RASMUS) is a rule-based diagnostic framework providing information on task performance and up to six user states affecting performance. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and optimize the existing diagnostic rules of RASMUS exemplary for the state of high mental workload. Modified rules were defined by performing receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses using the empirical data obtained in a prior validation experiment (N = 12). Subjective workload ratings served as comparative measure. Specifically, the analysis focused on optimizing the threshold values used to discriminate between critical and noncritical workload states for three physiological mental workload indicators, namely pupil dilation, heart rate variability and respiration rate. Subsequently, the prior validation study was repeated with N = 15 participants to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the initial and modified rule sets. Similar outcomes were found for the initial rule set confirming the temporal stability of the RASMUS diagnosis. However, contrary to expectations, the modified rule set showed less diagnostic accuracy when applied to the new data set. This result questions the practicality of ROC curve analysis for defining and optimizing rules in the context of physiological user state diagnosis.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - The increasing use of digitalized displays in the instrumentation & control systems of nuclear power plants has brought new issues related to human-computer interaction, especially under emergency circumstances that are known to be very stressful. This paper studies how interfaces with different information organization (functional layout vs. process layout) influence human-computer interaction behaviors as emergency occurs in terms of search efficiency, difficulty of information abstraction, and workload by using the eye tracking technique on a simulated platform. The result shows that the average blink rate and average blink numbers at the two levels of information organization were different significantly. This may indicate that the functional design was superior to the process design in user workload. The results did not prove the superiority of the functional interface design to the process one in search efficiency and difficulty of information abstraction, since no significant difference was found in the number of fixations and fixations duration mean values.

SP  - 367
EP  - 377

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In image retrieval, global features related to color or texture are commonly used to describe the image content. The problem with this approach is that these global features cannot capture all parts of the image having different characteristics. Therefore, local computation of image information is necessary. By using salient points to represent local information, more discriminative features can be computed. In this paper we compare a wavelet-based salient point extraction algorithm with two corner detectors using the criteria: repeatability rate and information content. We also show that extracting color and texture information in the locations given by our salient points provides significantly improved results in terms of retrieval accuracy, computational complexity, and storage space of feature vectors as compared to global feature approaches.

AB  - Eye movements and changes in pupil dilation are known to provide information about viewer’s attention and interaction with visual content. This paper evaluates different statistical and signal processing methods for autonomously analysing pupil dilation signals and extracting information about viewer’s attention when perceiving visual information. In particular, using a commercial video-based eye tracker to estimate pupil dilation and gaze fixation, we demonstrate that wavelet-based signal processing provides an effective tool for pupil dilation analysis and discuss the effect that different image content has on pupil dilation and viewer’s attention.

TI  - Evaluation of a gamified e-learning platform to improve traffic safety among elementary school pupils in Belgium
JO  - Personal and Ubiquitous Computing
AB  - Children are highly represented in statistics relating to road traffic injuries and fatalities. There are multiple risk factors that together create an increased risk for children in traffic, some of the major reasons include children’s inability to efficiently and actively scan the environment and look for information relevant to the traffic environment, inconsistent behavior, and less developed hazard perception skills. Traffic safety education is one of the most important means for improving knowledge and skills required for children to behave safely in traffic. This study evaluated a newly developed and gamified e-learning platform meant to promote traffic safety among elementary school pupils in Belgium. Participants in this study were from four grades of elementary school and voluntarily took part in the training. They followed a self-study program at home for approximately 15 min per week over a period of 5 weeks in total. The platform included four modules: traffic knowledge, situation awareness, risk detection, and risk management. For each of these modules, a set of photos and videos were used as stimuli and selected from a database of camera recordings of real-life situations. Half of each module consisted of familiar situations for the pupils (i.e., own municipality), while the other half of each module consisted of unfamiliar situations for the pupils (i.e., other municipalities). A fifth module, “the finale,” contained a mix of the first four modules. In total, 44 elementary school pupils (9–13 years old) completed the program. During the first round of measurement (i.e., the first four modules), pupils performed significantly better in the traffic knowledge module when compared with the other three modules. Further, in comparison with unfamiliar situations, pupils scored significantly higher in familiar situations. During the second round of measurement (i.e., the fifth module), pupils achieved higher scores in the risk detection and risk management modules when contrasted to the first measurement. The effect of gamification elements is discussed and the results also indicate the type of traffic safety issues to be emphasized in traffic safety education for children.

AB  - This chapter explores algorithms for the artistic stylization (transformation) of photographs into digital artwork, complementing techniques discussed so far in this book that focus on image generation. Most artistic stylization algorithms operate by placing atomic rendering primitives “strokes” on a virtual canvas, guided by automated artistic heuristics. In many cases the stroke placement process can be phrased as an optimization problem, demanding guided exploration of a high dimensional and turbulent search space to produce aesthetically pleasing renderings. Evolutionary search algorithms can offer attractive solutions to such problems.

AB  - The reliable estimation of the pupil position is one the most important prerequisites in gaze-based HMI applications. Despite the rich landscape of image-based methods for pupil extraction, tracking the pupil in real-world images is highly challenging due to variations in the environment (e.g. changing illumination conditions, reflection, etc.), in the eye physiology or due to variations related to further sources of noise (e.g., contact lenses or mascara). We present a novel algorithm for robust pupil detection in real-world scenarios, which is based on edge filtering and oriented histograms calculated via the Angular Integral Projection Function. The evaluation on over 38,000 new, hand-labeled eye images from real-world tasks and 600 images from related work showed an outstanding robustness of our algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Game-based learning environments (GBLEs) are often criticized for not offering adequate support for students when learning and problem solving within these environments. A key aspect of GBLEs is the verbal representation of information such as text. This study examined learners’ metacognitive judgments of informational text (e.g., books and articles) through eye gaze behaviors within Crystal Island (CI). Ninety-one undergraduate students interacted with game elements during problem-solving in CI, a GBLE focused on facilitating the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and domain-specific knowledge in microbiology. The results suggest engaging with informational text along with other goal-directed actions (actions needed to achieve the end goal) are large components of time spent within CI. Our findings revealed goal-directed actions, specifically reading informational texts, were significant predictors of participants’ proportional learning gains (PLGs) after problem solving with CI. Additionally, we found significant differences in PLGs where participants who spent a greater time fixating and reengaging with goal-relevant text within the environment demonstrated greater proportional learning after problem solving in CI.

AB  - This study evaluated users’ behaviors when performing inexpensive or expensive e-commerce purchases on familiar and unfamiliar Web sites. Users were more comfortable with making inexpensive than expensive purchases. They also felt more secure and that their privacy was better protected when shopping with a familiar Web site than an unfamiliar one, especially for expensive purchases. For inexpensive purchases, if the price was “right”, participants were willing to purchase the product on unfamiliar Web sites. For expensive purchases, though, the reputation of the organization hosting the Web site was the most important factor. In both cases, privacy was a minor determinant for deciding whether to make a purchase from a Web site. Only 20% of the users regularly accessed the sites’ privacy policies during their interactions with the sites. Moreover, less than half of the participants even looked at privacy-policy links during their interactions with the Web sites.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the computer supported collaborative problem solving processes using the dual eye-tracking method. 18 university students participated in this study, and 9 pairs tried to solve 10 geometry problems using Virtual Math Team (VMT) online environment. Which situations the participants’ eye movements, and eye gazes overlap, and how usability of VMT environment affect the problem solving processes are tried to identify. After experiments with two eye-trackers, a questionnaire including System Usability Scale and open-ended questions was filled by participants. Eye-tracker data were analyzed both quantitatively using cross-recurrence analysis, and qualitatively using interaction analysis. Analysis of eye-tracker data and open-ended questions are consistent, and support to each other. Results show that pairs collaborating with higher level have more gazes overlapping, more shared understanding, and anticipatory gazes than pairs having with low level. Also, usability of the system and awareness tools affect the collaboration processes.

SP  - 137
EP  - 144
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we develop a novel human implicit intention understanding model by mimicking the human-like visual attention and brain information processing mechanisms. In other words, the proposed model considers a hybrid cognitive neural system, which comprises of spatial attention model obtained based on exogenous and endogenous attention models. Generally, information can be selected via top-down or endogenous mechanisms depending on the goals of the observers while salient objects or events attract spatial attention via bottom-up or exogenous mechanisms allowing a rapid and efficient reaction to unexpected but important events. Given a visual stimulus, the spatial analysis module identifies the objects of interest by correlating the salient areas obtained from the exogenous module and the eye gaze information obtained from the endogenous module. Then, corresponding to an intent, each of the identified objects are classified in to one of the two classes - intent object or non-intent object, by analyzing the features such as fixation length (FL), fixation count (FC) and pupil size (PS) corresponding to each object. In the proposed model, support vector machine (SVM) is trained for classifying the different objects. Experimental results show that the proposed model generates plausible performance based on hybrid cognitive neural system.

Experiments are very effective in determining causation in controlled situations and complement techniques that investigate ongoing behavior in more natural settings. For example, experiments are excellent for determining whether increased audio quality reduces blood pressure of participants in a video conference, and can add important insights to the larger question of when people choose video conferences over audio-only ones.

AB  - Metadata describing the content of photos are of high importance for applications like image search or as part of training sets for object detection algorithms. In this work, we apply tags to image regions for a more detailed description of the photo semantics. This region labeling is performed without additional effort from the user, just from analyzing eye tracking data, recorded while users are playing a gaze-controlled game. In the game EyeGrab, users classify and rate photos falling down the screen. The photos are classified according to a given category under time pressure. The game has been evaluated in a study with 54 subjects. The results show that it is possible to assign the given categories to image regions with a precision of up to 61%. This shows that we can perform an almost equally good region labeling using an immersive environment like in EyeGrab compared to a previous classification experiment that was much more controlled.

AB  - Traditional user authentication methods using passcode or finger movement on smartphones are vulnerable to shoulder surfing attack, smudge attack, and keylogger attack. These attacks are able to infer a passcode based on the information collection of user’s finger movement or tapping input. As an alternative user authentication approach, eye tracking can reduce the risk of suffering those attacks effectively because no hand input is required. However, most existing eye tracking techniques are designed for large screen devices. Many of them depend on special hardware like high resolution eye tracker and special process like calibration, which are not readily available for smartphone users. In this paper, we propose a new eye tracking method for user authentication on a smartphone. It utilizes the smartphone’s front camera to capture a user’s eye movement trajectories which are used as the input of user authentication. No special hardware or calibration process is needed. We develop a prototype and evaluate its effectiveness on an Android smartphone. We recruit a group of volunteers to participate in the user study. Our evaluation results show that the proposed eye tracking technique achieves very high accuracy in user authentication.

TI  - Exploiting Interaction Features in User Intent Understanding

SP  - 506
EP  - 517
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Understanding user intent during a web navigation session is a challenging topic, which is drawing the attention of many researchers in this area. The achievements of such research goals would have a great impact on many internet-based applications. For instance, if a search engine had the capability of capturing user intents, it could better suite the order of search results to user needs. In this context, the research has mainly focused on the analysis of user interactions with Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) resulting from a web query, but most methods ignore the behavior of the user during the exploration of web pages associated to the links of the SERP s/he decides to visit. In this paper we propose a novel model that analyzes user interactions on such pages, in addition to the information considered by other mentioned approaches. In particular, captured user interactions are translated into features that are part of the input of a classification algorithm aiming to determine user informational, navigational, and transactional intents. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing how the additional analysis it performs on visited web pages contributes to enhance user intent understanding.

AB  - Visual search data describe people’s performance on the common perceptual problem of identifying target objects in a complex scene. Technological advances in areas such as eye tracking now provide researchers with a wealth of data not previously available. The goal of this work is to support researchers in analyzing this complex and multimodal data and in developing new insights into visual search techniques. We discuss several methods drawn from the statistics and machine learning literature for integrating visual search data derived from multiple sources and performing exploratory data analysis. We ground our discussion in a specific task performed by officers at the Transportation Security Administration and consider the applicability, likely issues, and possible adaptations of several candidate analysis methods.

SP  - 53
EP  - 71
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Information visualizations of quantitative data are rapidly becoming more complex as the dimension and volume of data increases. Critical to modern applications, an information visualization is used to communicate numeric data using objects such as lines, rectangles, bars, circles, and so forth. Via visual inspection, the viewer assigns numbers to these objects using their geometric properties of size and shape. Any difference between this estimation and the desired numeric value we call the “visual measurement error”. The research objective of this paper is to propose models of the visual measure error utilizing stochastic geometry. The fundamental technique in building our models is the conceptualization of eye fixation points as might be determined by an eye-tracking experiment of viewers estimating size and shape of a visualization’s object configurations. The fixation points are first considered as a stochastic point process whose characteristics require comment before proceeding to the statistical shape analysis of the visualization. Once clarified the fixation points are reinterpreted as a sampling of the shape and size of the landmark configurations of geometric landmarks on the visualization. The ultimate end of these models is to find optimal shape and size parameters leading to minimum visual measurement error.

AB  - This paper explores the value of eye-tracking data to assess user learning with interactive simulations (IS). Our long-term goal is to use this data in user models that can generate adaptive support for students who do not learn well with these types of unstructured learning environments. We collected gaze data from users interacting with the CSP applet, an IS for constraint satisfaction problems. Two classifiers built upon this data achieved good accuracy in discriminating between students who learn well from the CSP applet and students who do not, providing evidence that gaze data can be a valuable source of information for building user modes for IS.

AB  - Trust plays a critical role in facilitating transactions in the online shopping environment. Accordingly, various methods have been considered to enhance customer trust. Human branding has received increased attention and played a vital role in business in recent years because it has great impacts on our daily life and consumption. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of applying human brands in an online shopping environment with an emphasis on product type and human brand attachment. The study combines the eye-tracking technique with a self-reported questionnaire to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of human branding in the online shopping process. The results showed that both the product type and level of human brand attachment have significant influences on a customer’s visual attention as well as perceived trust towards the product.

CY  - Cham
AB  - E-dictionaries applications (apps) have been widely used as tools for language learning. There has been little experimental research examining what learners focus or learn when they use the e-dictionaries, although some studies have looked at the user satisfaction and feature requirements of e-dictionaries. This current study used eye-tracking technology to examine what information the participants paid attention to, and how the participants processed information when using e-dictionaries. Fifteen college students participated in the study. The participants were asked to fill a survey and then to view eight vocabulary interfaces from three e-dictionaries. The participants’ eye fixations and viewing paths suggested that the interface layouts of the e-dictionaries affected their attention and displaying patterns. The eye-tracking data by the participants, however, did not match with the reported data filled out by the participants. Detailed results and implications for design and learning are discussed.

AB  - In collaborative tasks, people rely both on verbal and non-verbal cues simultaneously to communicate with each other. For human-robot interaction to run smoothly and naturally, a robot should be equipped with the ability to robustly disambiguate referring expressions. In this work, we propose a model that can disambiguate multimodal fetching requests using modalities such as head movements, hand gestures, and speech. We analysed the acquired data from mixed reality experiments and formulated a hypothesis that modelling temporal dependencies of events in these three modalities increases the model’s predictive power. We evaluated our model on a Bayesian framework to interpret referring expressions with and without exploiting the temporal prior.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This study aims to investigate user visual attention level in their mobile shopping activities based on our eye-tracking experiment, which may potentially contribute to the development in mobile commerce website design. We found that the distribution of products information in a page may have a great impact on visual search behavior and reaction time. Reaction time is normally at a minimum when target element is put on the top left. Conversely, it tends to increase when target element is put on the bottom right. Moreover, visual attention focus between computer based web pages and mobile ones is also different based on our research in characteristics of eye-tracking. Previous study has reported that user focus is mostly on higher position entries in a search engine result page, however in our research, users concern the items displayed at the central area more than the top. This is probably because that the size of a mobile shopping page is not as big as a computer based web page, also with more limited information. This finding may be a hint to enhance mobile commerce website design.

We carried out a user study which compared a proposed new interface in the Mozilla Firefox browser with an alternative interface of our own design to investigate how users react to these new indicators. Our study included eye tracking data which provided empirical evidence with respect to which parts of the browser interface users tended to look at during the study and which areas went unnoticed. Our results show that, while the new interface features in the unmodified Firefox browser went unnoticed by all users in our study, the modified design was noticed by over half of the participants, and most users show a willingness to adopt these features once made aware of their functionality.

TI  - Exploring eye-tracking analyses of EFL learners’ cognitive processing of reduced relative clause
JO  - Cluster Computing
AB  - Eye-tracking technique is regarded as a reliable sensitive measurement to detect the regulation of eye movements, from which the objective visual data could be detected to explain invisible cognitive behavior. This paper employed eye-tracking sensors to examine how learners process reduced relative clause (RRC) sentences. The current research recruited 60 college students from a Chinese university to read three different types of RRC exemplars: left-branching, center-embodied and right-branching, and the sentences of each type were inserted frequent and/or infrequent verbs. The eye trackers were utilized to capture their eyes movements, and the instant visual data including fixation duration, fixation count as well as the scanning path were collected, compared and analysed. The results indicated that learners had the highest cognitive load when processing the center-embedded type of RRC, followed by the right-branching type and the left-branching type. Additionally, when the participant’s cognitive load is at a high level, the influence of verb frequency tends to be diminished. Besides, the results also revealed that the focus on the key areas, such as the conjunction, played a critical role in sentence processing. Furthermore, there leave several valuable practical and theoretical implications for further research. Firstly, eye-tracking technology is an adaptability for the measurement of mental process, which provide visualized evaluation of human–computer interaction. Secondly, the cognitive load theory could be extended and further studied though biofeedback data in the future.

AB  - We conducted eye-tracking studies of subjects solving the problem of finding shortest paths in a graph using a known procedure (Dijkstra’s algorithm). The goal of these studies was to investigate how people reason about and solve graphically presented problems. First, we compared performance when the graphical display was animated to when the display was static. Second, we compared performance when the display was initially sparse, with detailed information being progressively revealed, to when the display presented all information simultaneously. Results suggest that while animation of the procedure or algorithm does not improve accuracy, animation coupled with progressively revealing objects of interest on the display does improve accuracy and other process measures of problem solving.

AB  - Measurement of eye physiology is an increasingly utilized tool in studying the usability of digital products. Measures include fixation counts and fixation duration, both indicators of attention, as well as pupillometry, a measure known to correlate with workload and arousal. Although most eye-tracking systems collect pupillometry data, its utility has yet to be fully realized in usability testing. In particular, it is still unclear whether the measure provides additional insight into the user experience over and above that provided by traditional eye-movement measures. The present study seeks to examine the relationship between pupillary response and fixation in the context of a usability task. Specifically, we use data from a formative user experience research study to explore whether, and under which conditions, fixation measures and pupillary response measures correlate. A better understanding of the relationship will aid practitioners in the interpretation of pupillometry data.

By focusing on how personalization can be achieved in e-learning systems, the technologies used for establishing adaptive learning environments are explained and evaluated briefly. Some of these technologies are web services, multi-agent systems, semantic web and AI techniques such as case-based reasoning, neural networks and Bayesian networks used in intelligent tutoring systems. Finally, by discussing some of the adaptive distributed learning systems, an overall state of the art of the field is given with some future trends.

VL  - 20
IS  - 4
AB  - Mobile devices offer a common platform for both leisure and work-related tasks, but this has resulted in a blurred boundary between home and work. In this paper, we explore the security implications of this blurred boundary, both for the worker and the employer. Mobile workers may not always make optimal security-related choices when “on the go” and more impulsive individuals may be particularly affected as they are considered more vulnerable to distraction. In this study, we used a task scenario, in which 104 users were asked to choose a wireless network when responding to work demands while out of the office. Eye-tracking data was obtained from a subsample of 40 of these participants in order to explore the effects of impulsivity on attention. Our results suggest that impulsive people are more frequent users of public devices and networks in their day-to-day interactions and are more likely to access their social networks on a regular basis. However, they are also likely to make risky decisions when working on-the-go, processing fewer features before making those decisions. These results suggest that those with high impulsivity may make more use of the mobile Internet options for both work and private purposes, but they also show attentional behavior patterns that suggest they make less considered security-sensitive decisions. The findings are discussed in terms of designs that might support enhanced deliberation, both in the moment and also in relation to longer term behaviors that would contribute to a better work–life balance.

The strongly visual nature of these interactive information delivery tools mandates a new look at techniques for evaluating their usefulness and usability. Tracking the eyes of users as they work with such systems, when combined with traditional evaluation methods from Human—Computer Interaction, can provide a powerful new evaluation approach to the designer. This paper reports on the technical aspects of such an approach that we have developed, and describes a pilot experiment on its application to educational hypermedia.

The similarity obtained by these approaches does notalways correspond to the similarity a human user would expect. Away to include more semantic knowledge into the indexing processis to use the text included in the images and video sequences.It is rich in information but easy to use, e. g. by key wordbased queries. In this paper we present an algorithm to localiseartificial text in images and videos using a measure ofaccumulated gradients and morphological processing. The qualityof the localised text is improved by robust multiple frameintegration. A new technique for the binarisation of the textboxes based on a criterion maximizing local contrast isproposed. Finally, detection and OCR results for a commercialOCR are presented, justifying the choice of the binarisationtechnique.

AB  - Personality traits are an important part of the psychology with so many study to consider this actually a huge field. On the other hand, the relationship between personality traits and attentional process has not been deepen extended yet, above all using technological advanced measures to quantify attention. In this study we selected personal and neutral photos presenting all of them to the participants while tracking the eyes movements by using an eye-tracker. Results showed that personal images have in general higher number of fixation and more saccades. Specifically, while extroverts showed no differences in exploring personal and neutral photos, introverts participants showed an higher number of fixations and more saccades for personal images than neutral. These results if confirmed in further studies pone interesting questions about the role of personality in attentional processes linked to personal experiences.

In order to get insights, we conducted a study that is made up of 4 different conditions (2 roles and 2 gaze integrations). Results show, depending on the type of the gaze integration and the role, positive effects of gaze towards an increased awareness and engagement among participants. Through the inclusion of shared gaze information, a new nonverbal communication channel for players and spectators is created that presents an interesting design resource for future approaches of digital play. Designers should receive information on how to design gaze-based interfaces that do not distract players during play, and also give spectators the possibility to experience a game via the player’s eyes.

AB  - This paper presents two case studies of two children with severe motor disabilities. After years of no effective feedback from them, an interdisciplinary approach had been explored with the use of an eye controlled computer. A multidisciplinary team in clinical environment included a specialist in physical and rehabilitation medicine, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist and an engineer. Several applications were tested to establish feedback from the users, using the only movement they were capable of: eye movement. Results have shown significant improvement in interaction and communication for both users. Some differences were present, possibly due to the age difference. Preparation of content for augmented and alternative communication is in progress for both users. We realized that awareness of the existent advanced assistive technology (AT) is crucial for more independent and qualitative life, from parents or care givers to all AT professionals, working in clinical environment.

AB  - The importance of conversation in a second language (L2) during international collaboration continues to increase, but the features of non-verbal communications such as eye gaze and gestures in L2 conversation have not been clarified to the extent they have in the native language (L1). This study provides quantitative analyses of both speakers’ and listeners’ eye gaze activities to examine their differences in interaction structures between L1 and L2. Our analyses clarify that the listeners gaze more at speakers in conversations in L2 than in L1 and that the speaker gazes more at the next speaker in conversations in L2 than in L1 when they join small-party conversations. These analyses demonstrate that interaction structures in L2 are different from those in L1.

AB  - Intelligent Tutoring Systems are now mature technologies that successfully help students to acquire new knowledge and competencies through various educational methods and in a personalized way. However, evaluating precisely what they recall at the end of the learning process remains a complex task. In this paper, we study if there are correlations between memory and gaze data in the context of e-education. Our long-term goal is to model the memory of students thank to an eye-tracker in a continuous and transparent way. These models could then be used to adapt recommendations of pedagogical resources to the students’ learning rate. So as to address this research question, we designed an experiment where students were asked to learn a short lesson about Esperanto. Our results show that some gaze characteristics are correlated with recall in memory.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This study evaluates the relationship between eye gaze and mouse cursor movements in a debugging task. 9 students with relevant programming experience participated in this study. Debugging difficulty was manipulated (error types; lexical, logical and syntactic) in order to measure the effects on debugging performance (accuracy and reaction time), eye gaze and mouse cursor behavior (frequency and duration of visits of target areas vs. non-target areas). Performance data showed that lexical errors are easier to find than logical errors. Mouse cursor behavior was a significant indication of the level of difficulty and therefore performance. The general pattern of mouse movements was comparable with eye gaze patterns. This study indicates that mouse data does add relevant information on top of eye gaze. These results support the idea of using mouse tracking as an alternative for inferring intentions.

Clear vision of an object is guaranteed only when its image falls steadily within that specific central part of the retina which is called fovea. In order to explore a visual scene, the eyes have to move in such a way as to bring the image of an object of interest onto the fovea and to maintain it stable

AB  - Eye movement patterns of science- and non-science students in solving scientific graph problems were compared. Experts (science-students) tended to spend more time, compared to novices, to comprehend the questions during the first run / inspection. Concerning the main graph region, both the True and False subregions (corresponding to correct and wrong answer choices, respectively) were inspected carefully during the first run. Significant differences were observed in the second run, in which the False region was fixated longer when participants made wrong responses.

AB  - This paper presents results showing that eye movements reflect spatial relations in mental images but not in mental models during nearly similar reasoning tasks with directions. These results contribute to the distinction between mental models and mental images based on eye movements. This differentiation may be applied in the field of human-computer interaction and intelligent assistance systems. We conducted two experiments about reasoning with cardinal directions employing three-term series problems in the form of: “X is southwest of Z; Y is east of X; as seen from Z, where is Y?” The results replicate, to some extent, previous findings about preferred mental models. Additionally, the results indicate that these preferences are susceptible to details of the instructions of the experiment.

AB  - Baby boomers and millennials form two major user groups that tend to exhibit different behaviors when viewing online information. Because important online information is often communicated via text, understanding the differences in the way textual information is scanned by these two user groups allow designers to better meet the needs of each group. Our results showed that saccadic amplitudes were strong predictor of user age groups when they were reading a relatively long and difficult text passage. These results help to improve online reading experience by examining metrics that can unobtrusively capture and compare the overall reading experience of younger and older users. The results are also relevant to research in designing advanced decision tools that use eye tracking to detect cognitive effort to respond to user needs.

AB  - The paper presents a brand new technique of performing human identification which is based on eye movements characteristic. Using this method, the system measures human’s eyes reaction for visual stimulation. The eyes of the person who is being identified follow the point on the computer screen and eye movement tracking system is used to collect information about eye movements during the experiment. The first experiments showed that it was possible to identify people by means of that method. The method scrutinized here has several significant advantages. It compiles behavioral and physiological aspects and therefore it is difficult to counterfeit and at the same time it is easy to perform. Moreover, it is possible to combine it with other camera-based techniques like iris or face recognition.

AB  - The purpose of this study is focusing on “Analysis for human’s Region of Interest (ROI) on complex images”, and collected the subject’s eye movement and ‘scan path’ when assessing perceptual image quality task by using eye tracking method. The participants in this study were 30 students with convenience sampling from design, management and engineering college in National Yunlin University of Science and Technology. 11 stimulus of this experiment was selected from ISO standard image by focus group, and the type of image was divided into still image, portrait, landscape and architecturally image. The two tasks in this experiment are ‘assessing perceptual image quality’ and ‘assessing perceptual color quality’. And analysis the ‘Fixation duration’ and ‘Amplitude of saccade’ of ROIs from eye movement when assessing perceptual image quality task. The results show 1. when the ‘perceptual color quality’ is higher and the ‘perceptual image quality’ is higher, too; 2. The subjects were tended to browse the still and landscape image widely when assess the perceptual image quality and perceptual color quality task; 3. In contrast to the still image, the subjects were focus on the face of portrait image; 4. The subjects’ eye movement was tended to stabilize and homogenize when assess the ‘perceptual color quality task’.

AB  - This research discusses a new approach that uses patterns of a person’s eye motion to improve human computer interaction between intelligent virtual agents (IVA) and the people who interact with them. This approach adds new capability to current eye tracking interfaces that focus on eye fixations instead of patterns of motion. The analysis of eye motion on the pattern level can deliver three values to an eye tracking interface: speed, interaction reliability, and a more complete understanding of user attention. This research builds a system, called InVision, to demonstrate how the analysis of eye fixation at the pattern level can improve eye tracking interfaces for human computer interaction. An IVA is built using this eye pattern analysis technique.

AB  - Combination of audio and visual information is expected to ensure an efficient interface design for spatial information. Then, we focus on Audio-visual (AV) fusion referred to the perception of unity of audio and visual information despite there spatial disparity [1]. Previous experiment showed that AV fusion varied over space mainly with horizontal eccentricity [2]. As audio spatial information is coded in relation to head position and visual information is coded relative to eye position, question arises on eye position effect. The current psychophysical experiment investigates the effect of horizontal eye position shift on the variation of AV fusion over the 2D frontal space. Results showed that eye position affects AV fusion. Current data support the need for including eye position inputs when displaying redundant visual and auditory information in integrated multimodal interfaces. Results are discussed considering the probable effect of visual display structure.

This work presents Eye Pull, Eye Push, a novel interaction concept for content transfer between public and personal devices using gaze and touch. We present three techniques that enable this interaction: Eye Cut & Paste, Eye Drag & Drop, and Eye Summon & Cast. We outline and discuss several scenarios in which these techniques can be used. In a user study we found that participants responded well to the visual feedback provided by Eye Drag & Drop during object movement. In contrast, we found that although Eye Summon & Cast significantly improved performance, participants had difficulty coordinating their hands and eyes during interaction.

AB  - Social network has become a global phenomenon which attracts a wide range of population from all around the world of different ages, and cultures. People are using online social networks for several purposes like sharing information, chatting with friends, sharing photos and commenting. However, the analysis of users’ behavior in social networks received little attention. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze user behavior in terms of users’ activities in social network sites by adopting eye tracking techniques. Four main measurements were examined which includes the first place user looks, time spent on areas of interest, main activities and completion time. Results from eye tracking analysis based on the first place user looks and on the time duration have indicated that wallpost recorded most users’ attention. Results have shown that the main activity was reading friends’ status on the wall posts area. The findings provide support for the effort to understand and to model user behavior using eye tracking technique.

Larger high-resolution displays have become an increasingly prominent format for many users. New user behavior patterns have been emerging between primary and secondary (also known as second screen) displays. This paper describes a new research approach in order to understand what attracts user attention and identifies what they see when interacting with these devices. A case study is presented that demonstrates the procedures and findings for a study that involves eye tracking of a large-screen television display. The study described is a user experience evaluation of dynamic on-screen content presented as a part of the display during a television program.

AB  - Research on the process of process modeling (PPM) studies how process models are created. It typically uses the logs of the interactions with the modeling tool to assess the modeler’s behavior. In this paper we suggest to introduce an additional stream of data (i.e., eye tracking) to improve the analysis of the PPM. We show that, by exploiting this additional source of information, we can refine the detection of comprehension phases (introducing activities such as “semantic validation” or “problem understanding”) as well as provide more exploratory visualizations (e.g., combined modeling phase diagram, heat maps, fixations distributions) both static and dynamic (i.e., movies with the evolution of the model and eye tracking data on top).

AB  - We propose a biological-based feature comparison for identifying salient Web objects. We compare several features extracted from eye tracking and EEG data with a baseline given by mean fixation impact introduced by Buscher. For this, we performed an experiment with 20 healthy subjects in which gaze position, pupil size and brain activity were recorded while browsing in a Web site adaptation. Our results show that there are EEG features that could be related to Web user attention in objects. In particular the Gamma Band RMS and the EEG Variance indicate that the longer subjects view a web object (more attention), the less brain signal disturbance appears. We also discarded pupil size features due to low correlation with baseline. These results suggest that EEG features could be used to identify salient objects without using the time users spent on them as done in previous methodologies.

AB  - Eye tracking has a long history in medical and psychological research as a tool for recording and studying human visual behavior. Real-time gaze-based text entry can also be a powerful means of communication and control for people with physical disabilities. Following recent technological advances and the advent of affordable eye trackers, there is a growing interest in pervasive attention-aware systems and interfaces that have the potential to revolutionize mainstream human-technology interaction. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the state-of-the art in eye tracking technology and gaze estimation. We discuss challenges involved in using a perceptual organ, the eye, as an input modality. Examples of real life applications are reviewed, together with design solutions derived from research results. We also discuss how to match the user requirements and key features of different eye tracking systems to find the best system for each task and application.

AB  - The human eye is an essential component in the communication between computers and their operators. For this reason, eye tracking technology provides a valuable perspective into HCI. This paper discusses three applications of eye tracking technology to the challenge of universal access. The first is the use of gaze-controlled systems that allow disabled users to operate computers and other modern technology. The second is the use of eye tracking as a research methodology to be used in designing interfaces that help to bridge the digital divide. The third is the use of eye data to examine cognitive attributes (i.e., workload, fatigue, etc.) of operators of complex systems as they complete critical tasks. Practical examples of each of the three applications are provided.

AB  - Eye tracking is the process of recording a person’s eye movement for the better understanding of his/her’s visual perception. Due to low costs and highly accurate systems the process of eye tracking is used in devices and applications to increase computer interaction and to study human behavior. Eye tracking is used in a wide range of applications but is almost absent in the engineering domain.

AB  - Eye tracking research has been commonly used in human computer interaction study. Researcher can collect data on user’s behavior through their eye movement by using eye tracking technique. Many company or individual has taken this technology for overcome usability issues in their website, application as well as games. It is not easy to design and develop educational game application. Many aspects must be considered in making a good game. Educational game needs to have good usability in order to be effective and easy to learn. In this paper, we analyze of eye tracking patterns (heat map and gaze plot) to evaluate user interface design in educational game. In addition, we proposed a user interface design guidelines to the issues that highlighted. We conducted experiments using Tobii T60 remote eye tracking system and ManGold software suite to capture and analyze the user’s experience when playing educational game. The findings suggest eye-tracking patterns consist of a series of metrics, such as ‘number of fixations’ and ‘heat map separation’ correlating with the user interface design issues and ineffective presentation.

AB  - Eye tracking methods can be used to help understand what people think about as they search for or compare visual information, such as data displayed in graphs, charts, and other visualizations. This chapter, intended for the visualization researcher who is new to eye tracking, focuses on decision making during data analysis. It steps through the progressive data abstraction that is required during analysis, describing both resources needed and results found. Examples are taken from a study that presented two graph types (linear, radial) in three styles (bar, line, area) to 32 participants. Tasks comprised comparisons between two data series on each graph, across 1–8 categorical dimensions. Analysis proceeded from creating visualizations (Level 0), to statistical factor effects (Level 1), to adding Areas of Interest (Level 2), to comparing scanning sequences (Level 3). Objective, metric-based analysis is advocated throughout, but deeper analyses (Level 3) can be tedious and resource-demanding. Research and new product needs are highlighted.

AB  - Asking respondents to record their activity in a diary can be a difficult task due to retrospective reporting and cognitive burden as well as the complexity of the data collection tool. Diary questionnaires typically require multiple pieces of information including demographics, activities, and duration over a data collection period. Like other questionnaire types, visual design principles can be used to help people perceive and understand what is being asked of them during diary measurement. Eye tracking, a technology that allows us to passively study people’s eye movements, has been used mostly for questionnaire testing within the survey research field. This study focuses on using eye tracking and other user experience measures to analyze how respondents perceive, understand and experience different designs of the paper Nielsen TV Diary. We used eye tracking to gain insights into visual elements that draw attention, the amount of text that respondents read (e.g., terms/instructions), and how respondents complete the survey. This paper centers on the collecting and analyzing of qualitative and quantitative measures of the user experience, including eye-tracking data (e.g., fixation count, time to fixate), participants’ verbalizations, self-reported satisfaction, and performance data (e.g., accuracy, steps to complete). We also provide recommendations about the design of the paper diary based on the user experience and eye-tracking results.

AB  - Facets can provide an interesting functionality in digital libraries. However, while some research shows facets are important, other research found facets are only moderately used. Therefore, in this exploratory study we compare two search interfaces; one where the facets panel is always visible and one where the facets panel is hidden by default. Our main research question is “Is folding the facets panel in a digital library search interface beneficial to academic users?” By performing an eye tracking study with N=24, we measured search efficiency, distribution of attention and user satisfaction. We found no significant differences in the eye tracking data nor in usability feedback and conclude that collapsing facets is neither beneficial nor detrimental.

We then link these results to task performance in order to provide insights on how to design user-adaptive information visualization systems. Our results show how the least effective intervention manifests itself as a distractor based on gaze patterns. The results also identify specific visualization regions that cause poor task performance in users with low values of certain cognitive measures, and should therefore be the target of personalized visualization support.

AB  - Rehabilitation plays a very important role to achieve highest possible level of self-dependence by people with disability or affected with stroke or injury/surgery to spine or brain. Several assistive technologies, including the popular computer vision-based technologies made this task simpler and easier and affordable. The main difficulty is to track eyes accurately of the person with involuntary head movements using computer vision based techniques, where eye-tracking is used as the basic and essential step towards rehabilitation. Majority of the works (reported in literature) do not intend for real-time application for rehabilitation as higher complexity, longer processing time, requirement of special or wearable hardware prevent them to be used for intended application of rehabilitation. The present research uses Haar-classifier for detection of face and eye from the cluttered background and then Improved Hough transform is applied for accurate eye centre tracking. Experiment has been carried out with a person having involuntary head movements in different difficult/critical environments. The average efficiency of detection for the most critical situation (during night for user with spectacles at a distance of 213 cm or 7 ft) has reached 99%, which establishes the acceptance of the method for day-and-night rehabilitation of people.

AB  - Eye tracking is the process of measuring where eye gaze is focused to infer what someone is paying attention to and/or ignoring. The object of focus could be a digital display (e.g., on a phone, tablet or computer) or another person in a conversation, for example in face-to-face settings or in video conferences. Researchers measure what is looked at (point of gaze) and for how long (gaze duration), and the order in which gaze shifts.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1063
EP  - 1102
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - Information Retrieval (IR) approaches, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Vector Space Model (VSM), are commonly applied to recover software traceability links. Recently, an approach based on developers’ eye gazes was proposed to retrieve traceability links. This paper presents a comparative study on IR and eye-gaze based approaches. In addition, it reports on the possibility of using eye gaze links as an alternative benchmark in comparison to commits. The study conducted asked developers to perform bug-localization tasks on the open source subject system JabRef. The iTrace environment, which is an eye tracking enabled Eclipse plugin, was used to collect eye gaze data. During the data collection phase, an eye tracker was used to gather the source code entities (SCE’s), developers looked at while solving these tasks. We present an algorithm that uses the collected gaze dataset to produce candidate traceability links related to the tasks. In the evaluation phase, we compared the results of our algorithm with the results of an IR technique, in two different contexts. In the first context, precision and recall metric values are reported for both IR and eye gaze approaches based on commits. In the second context, another set of developers were asked to rate the candidate links from each of the two techniques in terms of how useful they were in fixing the bugs. The eye gaze approach outperforms standard LSI and VSM approaches and reports a 55 % precision and 67 % recall on average for all tasks when compared to how the developers actually fixed the bug. In the second context, the usefulness results show that links generated by our algorithm were considered to be significantly more useful (to fix the bug) than those of the IR technique in a majority of tasks. We discuss the implications of this radically different method of deriving traceability links. Techniques for feature location/bug localization are commonly evaluated on benchmarks formed from commits as is done in the evaluation phase of this study. Although, commits are a reasonable source, they only capture entities that were eventually changed to fix a bug or resolve a feature. We investigate another type of benchmark based on eye tracking data, namely links generated from the bug-localization tasks given to the developers in the data collection phase. The source code entities relevant to subjected bugs recommended from IR methods are evaluated on both commits and links generated from eye gaze. The results of the benchmarking phase show that the use of eye tracking could form an effective (complementary) benchmark and add another interesting perspective in the evaluation of bug-localization techniques.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1109
EP  - 1154
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of dyslexia on the reading and comprehension of computer program code. Drawing upon work from the fields of program comprehension, eye tracking, dyslexia, models of reading and dyslexia gaze behaviour, a set of hypotheses is developed with which to investigate potential differences in the gaze behaviour of programmers with dyslexia compared to typical programmers. The hypotheses posit that, in general terms, programmers with dyslexia will show gaze behaviour of longer duration and a greater number of fixations on program features than typical programmers. An experiment is described in which 28 programmers (14 with dyslexia, 14 without dyslexia) were asked to read and explain three simple computer programs. Eye tracking technology is used to capture the gaze behaviour of the programmers. Data analysis suggests that the code reading behaviour of programmers with dyslexia is not what would be expected based on the dyslexia literature relating to natural text. In conjunction with further exploratory analysis, observations are made in relation to spatial differences in how programmers with dyslexia read and scan code. The results show that the gaze behaviour of programmers with dyslexia requires further study to understand effects such as code layout, identifier naming and line length. A possible impact on dyslexia gaze behaviour is from the visual crowding of features in program code which might cause certain program features to receive less attention during a program comprehension task.

EP  - 13
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
AB  - Eye tracking has been used successfully as a technique for measuring cognitive load in reading, psycholinguistics, writing, language acquisition etc. for some time now. Its application as a technique for measuring the reading ease of MT output has not yet, to our knowledge, been tested. We report here on a preliminary study testing the use and validity of an eye tracking methodology as a means of semi-automatically evaluating machine translation output. 50 French machine translated sentences, 25 rated as excellent and 25 rated as poor in an earlier human evaluation, were selected. Ten native speakers of French were instructed to read the MT sentences for comprehensibility. Their eye gaze data were recorded non-invasively using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker. The average gaze time and fixation count were found to be higher for the “bad” sentences, while average fixation duration and pupil dilations were not found to be substantially different for output rated as good and output rated as bad. Comparisons between HTER scores and eye gaze data were also found to correlate well with gaze time and fixation count, but not with pupil dilation and fixation duration. We conclude that the eye tracking data, in particular gaze time and fixation count, correlate reasonably well with human evaluation of MT output but fixation duration and pupil dilation may be less reliable indicators of reading difficulty for MT output. We also conclude that eye tracking has promise as a semi-automatic MT evaluation technique, which does not require bi-lingual knowledge, and which can potentially tap into the end users’ experience of machine translation output.

AB  - In public display contexts, interactions are spontaneous and have to work without preparation. We propose gaze as a modality for such contexts, as gaze is always at the ready, and a natural indicator of the user’s interest. We present GazeHorizon, a system that demonstrates spontaneous gaze interaction, enabling users to walk up to a display and navigate content using their eyes only. GazeHorizon is extemporaneous and optimised for instantaneous usability by any user without prior configuration, calibration or training. The system provides interactive assistance to bootstrap gaze interaction with unaware users, employs a single off-the-shelf web camera and computer vision for person-independent tracking of the horizontal gaze direction and maps this input to rate-controlled navigation of horizontally arranged content. We have evaluated GazeHorizon through a series of field studies, culminating in a 4-day deployment in a public environment during which over a hundred passers-by interacted with it, unprompted and unassisted. We realised that since eye movements are subtle, users cannot learn gaze interaction from only observing others and as a result guidance is required.

VL  - 21
IS  - 6
AB  - Nowadays, we are living in a world where information is readily available and being able to provide the learner with the best suited situations and environment for his/her learning experiences is of utmost importance. In most learning environments, information is basically available in the form of written text. According to the eye-tracking technology, eye movements, scanning patterns and pupil diameter are indicators of thought and mental processing involved during visual information extraction. Hence, learners can be supported and guided throughout their learning journey by the real-time information of the precise position of gaze and of pupil diameter. A proper interpretation and consequently an efficient monitoring or supervision of learners’ eye movements by different methods of eye tracking may lead to an enhanced learning process and experience. This research gives an insight of the various existing techniques that contribute to the improvement of the learning mechanism through proposing a real time monitoring system using image processing and eye detection techniques. To portray such a robust mechanism, a multipronged eye tracking approach has been envisioned. The system is deployed with a first identification of the user’s eyes followed by the detection of the iris and pupil movements of the latter. Subsequently, the information about the eyes and pupil movements were analysed and graphs were generated that helps in determining the interest and behaviour of the user. To evaluate the accuracy of the system, some user tests and various scenarios in different application domains have been performed by computing the tracking error rate and as a result it has been noticed that these tests yield to an acceptable efficiency rate and a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of around 75 %. Moreover, the proposed system is a low cost system and can be compatible with any computer or laptop equipped with an ordinary web camera.

This paper presents a study on developing a novel eye-gaze driven technique for surgical assessment and workflow recovery. The proposed technique investigates the use of a Parallel Layer Perceptor (PLP) to automate the recognition of a key surgical step in a porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy model. The classifier is eye-gaze contingent but combined with image based visual feature detection for improved system performance. Experimental results show that by fusing image instrument likelihood measures, an overall classification accuracy of 75% is achieved.

AB  - In line with the continuous growth rates in online retailing, the competitive situation for retailers has intensified. In order to strengthen their market position and exploit further potential, online retailers need to address the specific needs of their customers. In this context, a more detailed analysis of gender-specific preferences is expected to be worthwhile, as men and women might have different needs when shopping on the Internet. This study explores in-depth the extent to which the gender-specific design of online shops has an influence on the genders. The aim of this study is to answer the following question: Do women and men exhibit different information research and buying behavior when utilizing online shops designed to appeal to their respective genders? An eye-tracking method was chosen for this study with 80 participants.

AB  - Two studies are reported exploring the usefulness of eye-tracking techniques in illuminatingcomputer users’ behaviour in conducting collaborative tasks while supported by multimedia communications. We describe how the technology was deployed and the data we derived to explore the use of visual cues incomputer-supported collaborative problem solving. Participants made modest use of the video-link to their remote collaborator, devoting most of their visual attention to other onscreen resources. Varying the quality of this video-link did not influence its use. Eye-tracking was found to be a viable and useful evaluation technique in CSCW.

AB  - There is a current trend in commercial aviation that points toward a possible transition from two-crew to single-pilot operations (SPO). The workload on the single pilot is expected to be a major issue for SPO. In order to find the best support solutions for the pilot in SPO, a thorough understanding of pilot workload is required. The present study aims at evaluating pilot workload by means of eye-tracking metrics. A flight simulator study was conducted with commercial pilots. Their task was to fly short approach and landing scenarios with or without the support of a second pilot. The results showed that fixation frequencies were higher during SPO, average dwell durations decreased, and participants transitioned more frequently between different areas of interest. These results suggest that particularly the temporal demand requires adequate support for a possible transition to SPO. The eye-tracking metrics support results obtained from subjective workload ratings.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We used eye-tracking to study 28 users when they evaluated result lists produced by web search engines. Based on their different evaluation styles, the users were divided into economic and exhaustive evaluators. Economic evaluators made their decision about the next action (e.g., query re-formulation, following a link) faster and based on less information than exhaustive evaluators. The economic evaluation style was especially beneficial when most of the results in the result page were relevant. In these tasks, the task times were significantly shorter for economic than for exhaustive evaluators. The results suggested that economic evaluators were more experienced with computers than exhaustive evaluators. Thus, the result evaluation style seems to evolve towards a more economic style as the users gain more experience.

AB  - Recommender systems, as a type of Web personalized service to support users’ online product searching, have been widely developed in recent years but with primary emphasis on algorithm accuracy. In this paper, we particularly investigate the efficacy of recommender interface designs in affecting users’ decision making strategies through the observation of their eye movements and product selection behavior. One interface design is the standard list interface where all recommended items are listed one by one. Another two are layout variations of organization-based interface where recommendations are grouped into categories. The eye-tracking user evaluation shows that the organization interfaces, especially the one with a quadrant layout, can significantly attract users’ attentions to more items, with the resulting benefit to enhance their objective decision quality.

CY  - Boston, MA
AB  - environmental control is the control, operation, and monitoring of an environment via intermediary technology such as a computer. Typically this means control of a domestic home.Within the scope of COGAIN, this environmental control concerns the control of the personal environment of a person (with or without a disability). This defines environmental control as the control of a home or domestic setting and those objects that are within that setting. Thus, we may say that environmental control systems enable anyone to operate a wide range of domestic appliances and other vital functions in the home by remote control. In recent years the problem of self-sufficiency for older people and people with a disability has attracted increasing attention and resources. The search for new solutions that can guarantee greater autonomy and a better quality of life has begun to exploit easily available state-of-the-art technology. Personal environmental control can be considered to be a comprehensive and effective aid, adaptable to the functional possibilities of the user and to their desired actions.

AB  - In this paper, we proposed and evaluated an adaptive recommendation system based on users’ eye-tracking data and an optimization algorithm called IGA. An eye tracker was utilized to acquire users’ eye movement data and extract three measures, which were respectively number of fixation, fixation duration and the first fixation on target item. Based on the results on the three measures, we inferred users’ preferences and adjusted the user interfaces based on users’ preferences. We developed a prototype system, which could adaptively recommend digital cameras to users. Then we conducted a user study with the prototype system and found that participants could identify their preferred products with a comparatively less time period and higher satisfaction.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of a shared gaze approach on social presence in an online cooperative game. We explored how a shared gaze visualization changes how players work together and form collaborative strategies based on different combinations of gaze interaction and verbal communication. Our study findings highlight the positive influence of a shared gaze visualization on team cohesion and involvement towards increased perceived social presence among cooperating team members. With our findings we want to inform game designers with insights on the inclusion of gaze-based interaction in remote gaming settings and whether this can strengthen the social bond between players. Our approach aims at fostering social couplings in remote collaborative gaming and investigates their potential to increase the connectedness between players.

Formerly, we identified mathematics learning opportunities in a real time strategy video game. Going further, in order to precisely understand which information the students use to solve the challenges provided by the video game, this paper presents an eye tracker based tool to identify processes of mathematics problem solving while playing the game. The first preliminary results show the potential of the tool to further identify metacognitive and mathematics problem solving processes.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Physical activity has emerged as a novel input modality for so-called active video games. Input devices such as music instruments, dance mats or the Wii accessories allow for novel ways of interaction and a more immersive gaming experience. In this work we describe how eye movements recognised from electrooculographic (EOG) signals can be used for gaming purposes in three different scenarios. In contrast to common video-based systems, EOG can be implemented as a wearable and light-weight system which allows for long-term use with unconstrained simultaneous physical activity. In a stationary computer game we show that eye gestures of varying complexity can be recognised online with equal performance to a state-of-the-art video-based system. For pervasive gaming scenarios, we show how eye movements can be recognised in the presence of signal artefacts caused by physical activity such as walking. Finally, we describe possible future context-aware games which exploit unconscious eye movements and show which possibilities this new input modality may open up.

AB  - With ubiquitous use of electronic devices where personal information is often stored, secure authentication is greatly underscored. As conventional password entry approaches are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing, gaze-based authentication approaches have been developed, but most of them require extra eye trackers which usually rely on special hardware and are too expensive for ordinary people. Aimed at both shoulder-surfing resistance and practicality, we present EyeSec, a gaze-based authentication system which exploits state-of-art gaze tracking technology without requirement for additional hardware except for a webcam. EyeSec offers three kinds of authentications, i.e., gaze-based PIN, gaze-based pattern and gaze-based captcha. According to the results of experiment, the best-performing participants, aged between 21 and 35, achieve average $$76.2\%, $$76.2%,$$90.0\%$$90.0%, $$100.0\%$$100.0%success rate for passing the three kinds of authentications, respectively, which makes gaze-based authentication from theory to practice.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - Websites are prevalent these days. Web users make instantaneous judgments regarding a website based on their first impressions and usually decide either to stay on the website or bypass it during their initial interaction with the website. Hence, understanding users’ first impression is important for both practitioners and researchers. This research examines users’ first impression of websites using an eye tracker. Eye tracking can provide fixation points where users focus their attention on a stimulus. The eye tracking results indicate that users take at least 2.66 seconds to scan the website before they fixate their eyes on an element of the website. Our analysis also shows that first fixation duration lasted for 180 milliseconds. This indicates that after allocating attention to a specific area on a website, the eyes stopped to focus for 180 milliseconds during which the brain processed the visual information received from the eyes to organize the information and form an impression of the website.

AB  - Eye gaze tracking is an obvious candidate for a future input device, perhaps even for everyday computing. The hard problems with gaze-controlled interfaces are inaccuracy and inadvertent clicking. We attempt to mitigate these problems in the context of a gaze-controlled web browser. Four click alternatives (Dwell, Single Confirm, Multiple Confirm and Radial Confirm) were implemented along with a fifth mouse-controlled version for comparison. Two alternatives make use of additional buttons that confirm a selection made previously by dwell, hence improving accuracy. Our results indicate that the Multiple Confirm alternative performed best among the gaze-based alternatives; it makes use of multiple confirmation buttons when letting the user choose between different options. When compared to the mouse, the clicking times were worse but the accuracy was indistinguishable. User feedback also indicates that, although mouse was considered best, Multiple Confirm was not perceived as slow and generated excitement. This indicates that the Multiple Confirm click alternative has potential as an interaction method for gaze interfaces.

AB  - An efficient algorithm to iris segmentation and its application to automatic and non-intrusive gaze tracking and vigilance estimation is presented and discussed. A luminance gradient technique is used to fit the irises from face images. A robust preprocessing which mimics the human retina is used in such a way that a robust system to luminance variations is obtained and contrast enhancement is achieved. The validation of the proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated by using three well-known test databases: the FERET database, the Yale database and the Cohn-Kanade database. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed approach to be applied successfully in gaze direction and vigilance estimation.

AB  - With the recent availability of industry-grade, high-performing engines for video games production, researchers in different fields have been exploiting the advanced technologies offered by these artefacts to improve the quality of the interactive experiences they design. While these engines provide excellent and easy-to-use tools to design interfaces and complex rule-based systems to control the experience, there are some aspects of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research they do not support in the same way because of their original mission and related design patterns pointing at a different primary target audience. In particular, the more research in HCI evolves towards natural, socially engaging approaches, the more there is the need to rapidly design and deploy software architectures to support these new paradigms. Topics such as knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning and voice synthesis demand space as possible instruments within this new ideal design environment. In this work, we propose a framework, named FANTASIA, designed to integrate a set of chosen modules (a graph database, a dialogue manager, a game engine and a voice synthesis engine) and support rapid design and implementation of interactive applications for HCI studies. We will present a number of different case studies to exemplify how the proposed tools can be deployed to develop very different kinds of interactive applications and we will discuss ongoing and future work to further extend the framework we propose.

The facets of activity awareness are common ground, community of practice, social capital, and human development. We found that differences between the communities include different strategies for community building, UX status in the community, type of open UX design, and different ways to share information.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Attention is key to effective learning, but mind wandering, a phenomenon in which attention shifts from task-related processing to task-unrelated thoughts, is pervasive across learning tasks. Therefore, intelligent learning environments should benefit from mechanisms to detect and respond to attentional lapses, such as mind wandering. As a step in this direction, we report the development and validation of the first student-independent facial feature-based mind wandering detector. We collected training data in a lab study where participants self-reported when they caught themselves mind wandering over the course of completing a 32.5 min narrative film comprehension task. We used computer vision techniques to extract facial features and bodily movements from videos. Using supervised learning methods, we were able to detect a mind wandering with an F1 score of .390, which reflected a 31% improvement over a chance model. We discuss how our mind wandering detector can be used to adapt the learning experience, particularly for online learning contexts.

AB  - Data from human subjects recorded by an eyetracker while they are learning new faces shows a high degree of similarity in saccadic eye movements over a face. Such experiments suggest face recognition can be modeled as a sequential process, with each fixation providing observations using both foveal and parafoveal information. We describe a sequential model of face recognition that is incremental and scalable to large face images. Two approaches to implementing an artificial fovea are described, which transform a constant resolution image into a variable resolution image with acute resolution in the fovea, and an exponential decrease in resolution towards the periphery. For each individual in a database of faces, a hidden-Markov model (HMM) classifier is learned, where the observation sequences necessary to learn the HMMs are generated by fixating on different regions of a face. Detailed experimental results are provided which show the two foveal HMM classifiers outperform a more traditional HMM classifier built by moving a horizontal window from top to bottom on a highly subsampled face image.

AB  - This paper proposes a new human-machine interface particularly conceived for people with severe disabilities (specifically tetraplegic people), that allows them to interact with the computer for their everyday life by means of mouse pointer. In this system, called FaceMouse, instead of classical "pointer paradigm" that requires the user to look at the point where to move, we propose to use a paradigm called "derivative paradigm", where the user does not indicate the precise position, but the direction along which the mouse pointer must be moved. The proposed system is composed of a common, low-cost webcam, and by a set of computer vision techniques developed to identify the parts of the user’s face (the only body part that a tetraplegic person can move) and exploit them for moving the pointer. Specifically, the implemented algorithm is based on template matching to track the nose of the user and on cross-correlation to calculate the best match. Finally, several real applications of the system are described and experimental results carried out by disabled people are reported.

VL  - 48
IS  - 2
AB  - The amounts of available Semantic Web (SW) data (including Linked Open Data) constantly increases. Users would like to browse and explore effectively such information spaces without having to be acquainted with the various vocabularies and query language syntaxes. This paper discusses the work that has been done in the area for the case of RDF/S datasets, with emphasis on session-based interaction schemes for exploratory search. In particular, it surveys the related works according to various aspects, such as assumed user goals, structuring of the underlying information space, generality and configuration requirements, and various (state space-based) features of the navigation structure. Subsequently it introduces a small but concise formal model of the interaction (that captures the core functionalities) which is used as reference model for describing what the existing systems support. Finally the paper describes the evaluation methods that have been used. Overall, the presented analysis aids the understanding and comparison of the various different approaches that have been proposed so far.

AB  - In this paper, we present a framework for an expressive virtual storyteller for children. Our virtual storyteller displays facial expressions of appraisals related to story events. The facial expressions are animated jointly with deictic gestures towards graphical elements representing story events. We describe a preliminary study that we conducted with 23 children. We discuss the impact of facial expressions of appraisals on children’s memorization of story events, their perception of characters’ appraisals, their subjective perception of the virtual storyteller and more generally how emotion combines with joint attention.

AB  - Few studies have focused on integrating affective computing and soft computing technique for human physiology signals recognition in digital content learning system. This study develops a human affective norm (emotion and attention) recognition system for U-learning system. Eight elementary school students (4 male and 4 female) were recruited as participants to see some emotion pictures in international affective picture system (IAPS), and to collect their affective information—attention, meditation, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and SpO2 for developing the affective norm recognition system. These bio-physiology signals were extracted important features selection (Factor analysis) to serve as the input variables for radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. The results showed that all types of factor analysis did not perform well in our emotion norm database. Factor analysis with covariance extraction has higher accumulative variances than correlation extraction. This study suggested that future research can adopt more nonlinear feature selection methods to develop a high accuracy support vector machine based emotion recognition system.

JO  - Frontiers of Computer Science
SP  - 290
EP  - 306
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
AB  - Smartphone applications (apps) are becoming increasingly popular all over the world, particularly in the Chinese Generation Y population; however, surprisingly, only a small number of studies on app factors valued by this important group have been conducted. Because the competition among app developers is increasing, app factors that attract users’ attention are worth studying for sales promotion. This paper examines these factors through two separate studies. In the first study, i.e., Experiment 1, which consists of a survey, perceptual rating and verbal protocol methods are employed, and 90 randomly selected app websites are rated by 169 experienced smartphone users according to app attraction. Twelve of the most rated apps (six highest rated and six lowest rated) are selected for further investigation, and 11 influential factors that Generation Y members value are listed. A second study, i.e., Experiment 2, is conducted using the most and least rated app websites from Experiment 1, and eye tracking and verbal protocol methods are used. The eye movements of 45 participants are tracked while browsing these websites, providing evidence about what attracts these users’ attention and the order in which the app components are viewed. The results of these two studies suggest that Chinese Generation Y is a content-centric group when they browse the smartphone app marketplace. Icon, screenshot, price, rating, and name are the dominant and indispensable factors that influence purchase intentions, among which icon and screenshot should be meticulously designed. Price is another key factor that drives Chinese Generation Y’s attention. The recommended apps are the least dominant element. Design suggestions for app websites are also proposed. This research has important implications.

AB  - This paper presents a new GPU-based method for creating abstracted representations of photographs. Based on the constrained mean curvature flow and the Shock filter, our approach simplifies both shapes and colors simultaneously while preserving and conveying the directionality of important features and shape boundaries. The level of abstraction can be intuitively controlled by iteratively and incrementally applying the algorithm. Note that the whole pipeline design is highly parallel, enabling a GPU-based implementation. Our GPU-based method outperforms the CPU-based one with two magnitudes of speedup. Several experimental examples are shown to demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - Fast and robust ellipse detection algorithm for head-mounted eye tracking systems
JO  - Machine Vision and Applications
SP  - 845
EP  - 860
VL  - 29
IS  - 5
AB  - In head-mounted eye tracking systems, the correct detection of pupil position is a key factor in estimating gaze direction. However, this is a challenging issue when the videos are recorded in real-world conditions, due to the many sources of noise and artifacts that exist in these scenarios, such as rapid changes in illumination, reflections, occlusions and an elliptical appearance of the pupil. Thus, it is an indispensable prerequisite that a pupil detection algorithm is robust in these challenging conditions. In this work, we present one pupil center detection method based on searching the maximum contribution point to the radial symmetry of the image. Additionally, two different center refinement steps were incorporated with the aim of adapting the algorithm to images with highly elliptical pupil appearances. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a dataset consisting of 225,569 head-mounted annotated eye images from publicly available sources. The results are compared with the better algorithm found in the bibliography, with our algorithm being shown as superior.

AB  - With the development of assistive technology, eye typing has become an alternative form of text entry for physically challenged people with severe motor disabilities. However, additional eye-tracking devices need to be used to track eye movements which is inconvenient in some cases. In this paper, we propose an appearance-based method to estimate the person’s gaze point using a webcam, and also investigate some practical issues of the method. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of eye typing using the proposed method.

AB  - The EyeDee™ embedded eye tracking solution developed by SuriCog is the world’s first innovative solution using the eye as a real-time mobile digital cursor, while maintaining full mobility. The system consists in a wearable device capturing images on the human’s eye and sending these images over a transmission medium (wire/wireless transmission). One important request of this system is the real-time transmission of the captured images, along with low-power, low-heat, low-MIPS requirements. This work is concentrated around an improvement of the ROI (Region of Interest – region containing image of the human’s pupil) image compression performance achieved via extra information removal. The feature based compression lies on ROI image blocks classification, implemented using a neural network.

VL  - 74
IS  - 8
AB  - The chronological process of eye accommodation used when viewing objects was analysed to predict the size of viewed objects. Viewer’s visual evoked potentials (VEP), eye movements and pupil oscillations were measured while six sizes of Landolt circles were presented for 1s each. The significant features of the metrics were extracted to illustrate the perception process and the resulting sizes of visual stimuli. The stimulus sizes affect P1 and N1 delay times of VEP, means of eye movement lengths and pupil diameters and oscillations during the second 500 milliseconds of observation. The feasibility of prediction of stimulus sizes viewed was confirmed using the features of eye behaviour and support vector machines. Both indices of eye movements and pupil diameters were determined to be significant features for making predictions. The influences of the combination of features and viewer’s individual factors were also confirmed. This result suggests that features of oculo-motor indices reflect the size of objects being viewed and that these viewing sizes can be predicted using the features.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Figural effects demonstrate that the influence on reasoning performance derives from the figure of the presented syllogistic arguments (Johnson-Laird and Bara, 1984). It has been reported that figure P-M/M-S is easier to reason with than figure M-P/S-M with syllogistic generation paradigm (Johnson-Laird, 1984), where M is the middle term, S is the subject and P is the predicate of conclusion, respectively. However, the figural effects are still unclear in syllogistic evaluation paradigm. In order to study such effects, we employed the figure M-P/S-M/S-P and the figure P-M/M-S/S-P syllogistic evaluation tasks with 30 subjects using eye-movement. The results showed that figural effects that the figure P-M/M-S/S-P was more cognitively demanding than the figure M-P/S-M/S-P, occurred in major premise and conclusion for the early processes, and in both premises and conclusion for late processes, rather than in minor premise reported by Espino et al (2005) that the figure P-M/M-S has less cognitive load than the figure M-P/S-M with generation paradigm. Additionally, pre-/post-conclusion viewing analysis found that for the inspection times of both premises the figure P-M/M-S/S-P took up more cognitive resources than the figure M-P/S-M/S-P when after viewing the conclusion. The findings suggested there were differences in figural effects between evaluation and generation paradigm.

AB  - Automatic generation of film comic requires solving several challenging problems such as selecting important frames well conveying the whole story, trimming the frames to fit the shape of panels without corrupting the composition of original image and arranging visually pleasing speech balloons without hiding important objects in the panel. We propose a novel approach to the automatic generation of film comic. The key idea is to aggregate eye-tracking data and image features into a computational map, called iMap, for quantitatively measuring the importance of frames in terms of story content and user attention. The transition of iMap in time sequences provides the solution to frame selection. Word balloon arrangement and image trimming are realized as the results of optimizing the energy functions derived from the iMap.

We investigate the relationship in peer tutoring of convergence, interpersonal rapport, and student learning. We develop an approach for computational modeling of convergence by accounting for the horizontal richness and time-based dependencies that arise in non-stationary and noisy longitudinal interaction streams. Our results, which illustrate that rapport as well as convergence are significantly correlated with learning gains, provide guidelines for development of peer tutoring agents that can increase learning gains through subtle changes to improve tutor-tutee alignment.

AB  - In order to examine whether there is a fixation adjustment and whether expert and novice pilots differ in their adjustment patterns during the landing process, and to identify specific fixation indicators that might be linked with landing performance, the eye movement data marked at different height (50–40 ft, 40–30 ft, etc.) of 29 captains and 28 copilots which were all serving in civil airlines with valid commercial license was collected by glasses eye-tractor during landing missions on Airbus320 full-motion simulators. The results show that: The landing performance of the experts was higher than that of the novices, experts had significantly better scores in terms a significant difference on the score of landing position, landing load, and handling stability, the difference between experts and novices on attitude, yaw angle and bank angle of the aircraft were only approaching significant. The study also found evidence suggesting the pilots do adjust their gaze points during the landing process and the experts made such an adjustment in a more salient manner. The pilots reduced their times of watch to the front part of the runway but increased their times of watching the rear part of the runway during the landing process. As compared to the novices, experts put much more attention to the front part of the runway from very beginning to almost halfway (50–30 ft height rang feet).

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We present a technique for dynamically directing a viewer’s attention to a focus object by analyzing and modulating bottom-up salient features of a video feed. Rather than applying a static modulation strategy, we inspect the original image’s saliency map, and modify the image automatically to favor the focus object. Image fragments are adaptively darkened, lightened and manipulated in hue according to local contrast information rather than global parameters. The goal is to suggest rather than force the attention of the user towards a specific location. The technique’s goal is to apply only minimal changes to an image, while achieving a desired difference of saliency between focus and context regions of the image. Our technique exhibits temporal and spatial coherence and runs at interactive frame rates using GPU shaders. We present several application examples from the field of Mixed Reality, or more precisely Mediated Reality.

We explored two user groups: elderly users (50 years and above) and users between 20 and 30 years of age. Our focus was on how elderly people perceive and interpret a navigation oriented iTV application. Apart from the standard usability data we used eye-tracking data to gain more insight on why iTV usage seemed to be more difficult for the group of elderly.

AB  - Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, such as World of Warcraft, have become the most widespread 3D graphical environments with millions of active subscribers worldwide. People with severe motor impairments should be able to take part in these games without the extent of their disability being apparent to others online. Eye gaze is a high bandwidth modality that can support this. We have developed a software device that uses gaze input in different modes for emulating mouse and keyboard events appropriate for interacting with on-line games. We report an evaluation study that investigated gaze-based interaction with World of Warcraft using the device. We have found that it is feasible to carry out tasks representative of game play at a beginners skill level using gaze alone. The results from the locomotion task part of the study show similar performance for gaze-based interaction compared with a keyboard and mouse. We discuss the usability issues that arose when completing three types of tasks in the game and the implications of these for playing of this type of game using gaze as the only input modality.

Cognitive scientists, on the other hand have studied attention and shown how variables like complexity and order can be controlled to gain and maintain attention. This paper reports an experiment using patterns created based on information theoretic principles and eye tracking to reveal various interrelated insights that explain attention, visual focus and interest. It extrapolates these findings to understand architectural forms and concludes by offering a set of design strategies or a visual rationale for creating form.

EP  - 348

CY  - Cham
AB  - Purposeful collaboration of driver and front-seat passenger can help in demanding driving situations and therefore increase safety. The characteristics of the car, as a context, limit the collaboration possibilities of the driver and front-seat passenger, though. In this paper, we present an approach that supports successful collaboration of the driver and front-seat passenger with regard to the contextual specifics. By capturing the front-seat passenger’s gaze and visualizing it for the driver, we create a collaborative space for information sharing in the car. We present the results from a study investigating the potentials of the co-driver’s gaze as means to support the driver during a navigational task. Our results confirm that the co-driver’s gaze can serve as helpful means to support the collaboration of driver and front-seat passenger in terms of perceived distraction and workload of the driver.

VL  - 77

AB  - With the proliferation of video data, video summarization is an ideal tool for users to browse video content rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel foveated convolutional neural networks for dynamic video summarization. We are the first to integrate gaze information into a deep learning network for video summarization. Foveated images are constructed based on subjects’ eye movements to represent the spatial information of the input video. Multi-frame motion vectors are stacked across several adjacent frames to convey the motion clues. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two video summarization benchmark datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the gaze information for video summarization despite the fact that the eye movements are collected from different subjects from those who generated summaries. Empirical validations also demonstrate that our proposed foveated convolutional neural networks for video summarization can achieve state-of-the-art performances on these benchmark datasets.

TI  - Fragile base-class problem, problem?
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 2612
EP  - 2657
VL  - 22
IS  - 5
AB  - The fragile base-class problem (FBCP) has been described in the literature as a consequence of “misusing” inheritance and composition in object-oriented programming when (re)using frameworks. Many research works have focused on preventing the FBCP by proposing alternative mechanisms for reuse, but, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research work studying the prevalence and impact of the FBCP in real-world software systems. The goal of our work is thus twofold: (1) assess, in different systems, the prevalence of micro-architectures, called FBCS, that could lead to two aspects of the FBCP, (2) investigate the relation between the detected occurrences and the quality of the systems in terms of change and fault proneness, and (3) assess whether there exist bugs in these systems that are related to the FBCP. We therefore perform a quantitative and a qualitative study. Quantitatively, we analyse multiple versions of seven different open-source systems that use 58 different frameworks, resulting in 301 configurations. We detect in these systems 112,263 FBCS occurrences and we analyse whether classes playing the role of sub-classes in FBCS occurrences are more change and–or fault prone than other classes. Results show that classes participating in the analysed FBCS are neither more likely to change nor more likely to have faults. Qualitatively, we conduct a survey to confirm/infirm that some bugs are related to the FBCP. The survey involves 41 participants that analyse a total of 104 bugs of three open-source systems. Results indicate that none of the analysed bugs is related to the FBCP. Thus, despite large, rigorous quantitative and qualitative studies, we must conclude that the two aspects of the FBCP that we analyse may not be as problematic in terms of change and fault-proneness as previously thought in the literature. We propose reasons why the FBCP may not be so prevalent in the analysed systems and in other systems in general.

EP  - 219
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Around 10% of the population has dyslexia, a reading disability that negatively affects a person’s ability to read and comprehend texts. Previous work has studied how to optimize the text layout, but adapting the text content has not received that much attention. In this paper, we present an eye-tracking study that investigates if people with dyslexia would benefit from content simplification. In an experiment with 46 people, 23 with dyslexia and 23 as a control group, we compare texts where words were substituted by shorter/longer and more/less frequent synonyms. Using more frequent words caused the participants with dyslexia to read significantly faster, while the use of shorter words caused them to understand the text better. Amongst the control group, no significant effects were found. These results provide evidence that people with dyslexia may benefit from interactive tools that perform lexical simplification.

AB  - The growth in the use of mobile devices have allowed for the development of new educational modalities within e-Learning. Because of this, we have shown the evolution experienced by GreedEx, a desktop application that facilitates the learning of greedy algorithms. Two iPad versions were developed (GreedEx Tab v1.0 and v2.0). The first iPad version adapted many functionalities to mobile devices, whilst the latest one adds several pedagogical usability characteristics. For that, we followed the CIAM Mobile methodology, improving the educational and collaborative aspects. Our main aim is to verify that this methodology is useful for the production of new methodological approaches aligned with the principles of MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) that gives support to learning activities within a group. Therefore, this work can be considered a preliminary m-CIAM test case.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper presents PeTra, a framework proposed for representing and treating multi-source heterogeneous traces from simulated learning environments. We tested our proposition on traces from TELEOS, a simulation-based ITS dedicated to percutaneous orthopedic surgery. This ITS captures learners interactions from three different and independent sources. The conducted experiment demonstrated that the sequences generated by PeTra fostered efficiently: 1) the learning analytics task of evaluating the influence of visual perceptions on learners’ errors; 2) the extraction of interesting association rules potentially reusable for tutoring services production. However, its genericity has not been tested and it will need to be evaluated at a larger scale.

This problem is related to the teleteaching of image processing which uses already implemented libraries of algorithms. This is in the context of a teleteaching European project. We first give a Bayesian approach to this problem, by using an image basis. Then we show how to use the Haar transform for this purpose. Finally we give examples and discuss our approach.

TI  - From analytical purposes to data visualizations: a decision process guided by a conceptual framework and eye tracking
JO  - Software & Systems Modeling
AB  - Data visualizations are versatile tools for gaining cognitive access to large amounts of data and for making complex relationships in data understandable. This paper proposes a method for assessing data visualizations according to the purposes they fulfill in domain-specific data analysis settings. We introduce a framework that gets configured for a given analysis domain and allows to choose data visualizations in a methodically justified way, based on analysis questions that address different aspects of data to be analyzed. Based on the concepts addressed by the analysis questions, the framework provides systematic guidance for determining which data visualizations are able to serve which conceptual analysis interests. In a second step of the method, we propose to follow a data-driven approach and to experimentally compare alternative data visualizations for a particular analytical purpose. More specifically, we propose to use eye tracking to support justified decisions about which of the data visualizations selected with the help of the framework are most suitable for assessing the analysis domain in a cognitively efficient way. We demonstrate our approach of how to come from analytical purposes to data visualizations using the example domain of Process Modeling Behavior Analysis. The analyses are performed on the background of representative analysis questions from this domain.

AB  - Perception and attention mechanisms are of great importance for entities situated within complex dynamic environments. With roles extending greatly beyond passive information services about the external environment, such mechanisms actively prioritise, augment and expedite information to ensure that the potentially relevant is made available so appropriate action can take place. Here, we describe the rationale behind endowing artificial entities, or virtual agents, with real-time perception and attention systems. We cover the fundamentals of designing and building such systems. Once equipped, the resulting agents can achieve a more substantial connection with their environment for the purposes of reacting, planning, decision making and, ultimately, behaving.

On the left hand side, we see the general problem the decision makers are faced with: the choice task. Generally speaking, a choice task defines the problem of choosing the preferred out of a discrete and finite set of alternatives. The decision makers’ preferences determine what the preferred alternative is. Thus, in Sect. 2.1, we define both choice tasks and preferences.

AB  - In this paper we are interested in the saliency of visual content from wearable cameras. The subjective saliency in wearable video is studied first due to the psycho-visual experience on this content. Then the method for objective saliency map computation with a specific contribution based on geometrical saliency is proposed. Fusion of spatial, temporal and geometric cues in an objective saliency map is realized by the multiplicative operator. Resulting objective saliency maps are evaluated against the subjective maps with promising results, highlighting interesting performance of proposed geometric saliency model.

AB  - No matter how powerful or elegant the technologies underlying multimedia computing, it is the user interface that ultimately determines how these systems will be used. We provide an overview of two emerging areas of user-interface research that will play major roles in future multimedia systems: virtual environments and ubiquitous computing. We discuss what they are and why they are important, and describe their relationship to current multimedia systems. While mouse and window-based user interfaces provide access to 2D graphics, video, and sound, virtual environments not only involve interactive 3D graphics, but further address all our senses through the use of spatial audio, haptics, and other modalities. While it is still a research goal to provide high-throughput video on demand, ubiquitous computing will require that multimedia network infrastructure also support extremely low-latency interaction among large numbers of mobile wireless users. To arrive at an understanding of the needs, capabilities, and potential of these new paradigms, we introduce their terminology and technology, and explain the basic system architectures being explored, leading up to a discussion of key current research issues and future directions.

CY  - Cham
AB  - It is usually taken for granted that Direct Manipulation is the best interaction style for inexperienced or non-expert users; moreover, this style of interaction is generally considered the best for almost every situation and user. The recent shifts in technology that we all are currently experiencing have given rise to a great deal of new kinds of users performing specific tasks in a variety of scenarios. In this paper, we focus on users who access a system occasionally, infrequently, or in an unplanned way; i.e., users who do not want or cannot afford a learning curve. We show that for them, Direct Manipulation is not always the most suitable style of interaction. We assess the advantages of guiding this kind of users, in particular through the guided interaction framework known as Goal Driven Interaction. GDI can be viewed as a superset of wizards providing support far beyond a few steps through dialogs. Indeed, GDI is an interaction style with characteristics of its own. We report a complete user test that backs up previous hypotheses. The analysis of empirical data proves that GDI is more time-efficient than DM, requiring fewer moderator assistances for the users. Post-test questionnaires confirmed that participants had a strong preference for GDI.

AB  - Wearable cameras allow users to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favourable location, they frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision, methods understand the hands as a background/foreground segmentation problem that ignores two important issues: (i) Each pixel is sequentially classified creating a long processing queue, (ii) Hands are not a single “skin-like” moving element but a pair of interacting entities (left-right hand). This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated implementation of a left right-hand segmentation algorithm. The GPU implementation exploits the nature of the pixel-by-pixel classification strategy. The left-right identification is carried out by following a competitive likelihood test based the position and the angle of the segmented pixels.

AB  - Visual attention plays a critical role in game playing. A better understanding of the allocation of visual attention can benefit the design of game scenarios. In this paper we propose to design games in different difficulty levels based on the estimation of attention. We use eye movement information in an analysis of attention. Eye fixation and pursuit conditions are considered separately.We find that the image complexity at eye fixation points and the relative position between pursuit direction and disturbance during pursuit eye movements are significant for attention allocation. This result is applied to the design of an interactive 2D game having two difficulty levels. Player response speeds and scores are compared for each difficulty level of the game.

AB  - In this paper, we present a solution for computer assisted emotional analysis of game session. The proposed approach combines eye movements and facial expressions to annotate the perceived game objects with the expressed dominate emotions. Moreover, our system EMOGRAPH (Emotional Graph) gives easy access to information about user experience and predicts player’s emotions. The prediction mainly uses both subjective measures through questionnaire and objective measures through brain wave activity (electroencephalography - EEG) combined with eye tracking data. EMOGRAPH’s method was experimented on 21 participants playing horror game “Outlast”. Our results show the effectiveness of our method in the identification of the emotions and their triggers. We also present our emotion prediction approach using game scene’s design goal (defined by OCC variables from the model of emotions’ cognitive evaluation of Ortony, Clore and Collins [1]) to annotate the player’s situation in a scene and machine learning algorithms. The prediction results are promising and would widen possibilities in game design.

GUR consists of more than playtesting game; it comprises a collection of methods that allow designers to bring their creations closer to the initial vision of the player experience. With the prices of physiological sensors falling, and the advancement of research in this area, physiological evaluation will soon become a standard tool in GUR and game evaluation. Since mixed-method approaches are of increasingly prominent value, this chapter describes core GUR methods with a special focus on physiological evaluation, keeping in mind both benefits and limitations of the approach in academic and industrial applications.

Moving objects support vision and processing the information conveyed in children with CVI; they also find it easier to deal with more simple images. Our serious games help them keeping focused on the exercise by using touch interface, the game paradigm and cartoon characters. The paper reports lesson learned from data collected in a user study to highlight the high potential of using these games also in the rehabilitation process, which brings us to develop the games also in a mobile platform to allow children train the skill at home, i.e., more intensively and in a familiar environment.

AB  - Findings from eye movement research in humans have demonstrated that the task determines where to look. One hypothesis is that the purpose of looking is to reduce uncertainty about properties relevant to the task. Following this hypothesis, we define a model that poses the problem of where to look as one of maximising task performance by reducing task relevant uncertainty. We implement and test our model on a simulated humanoid robot which has to move objects from a table into containers. Our model outperforms and is more robust than two other baseline schemes in terms of task performance whilst varying three environmental conditions, reach/grasp sensitivity, observation noise and the camera’s field of view.

AB  - Screen magnifiers are one of the core tools to assist people with visual impairments in accessing digital content. We introduce an approach to minimize interaction requirements by magnifying at the fixation point/area which is identified using eye tracking. Screen magnifiers mostly use the cursor to define the magnification area and ask for configuring when and how to magnify. This paper presents a modular design of a gaze based magnification tool reducing interaction tasks and thereby also supporting a good overview of the content and thereby showing potential to improve usability. Modularization supports an easy integration of filtering and personalization techniques to support adjustment of gaze based magnification to unusual eye-movements as e.g. nystagmus.

AB  - This study described a method of using glance behavior as design indices of In-Vehicle Visual Support (IVVS) system. The method was implemented to evaluate information content of the IVVS to facilitate operation of a mobile crane, which was challenging due to depth perception and load oscillation. The results suggested information content was well-discriminated using gaze behavior, which indicated its feasibility as design indices. Most importantly, emotional response was well-defined using gaze behavior. By not requiring self-evaluation of emotional response after the experimental procedure, design of IVVS could be evaluated by observing gaze behavior simultaneously during the experiment. In addition, elements of bias and social masking could be minimized because gaze response is sub-conscious.

AB  - Learning by doing, such as when learners give explanations to peer learners in collaborative learning, is known to be an effective strategy for gaining knowledge. This study used two types of facilitation technology in a simple explanation task to experimentally investigate those influence on the performance of understanding self’s concept during collaborative explanation activity. Dyads were given a topic about cognitive psychology and were required to use two different theoretical concepts, each of which was provided separately to one or the other of them, and explain the topic to each other. Two types of facilitation were examined: (1) use of a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA) and (2) visual gaze feedback using eye-track sensing. The PCA was expected to enable greater support of task-based activity (task-work) and visual gaze feedback to support learner coordination within the dyads (team-work). Results show that gaze feedback was effective when there was no PCA, and the PCA was effective when there was no gaze feedback on explaining self’s concept. This work provides preliminary implications on designing collaborative learning technologies using tutoring agents and sensing technology.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We present the results of a first experimental study to improve the computation of saliency maps, by using luminance and depth images features. More specifically, we have recorded the center of gaze of users when they were viewing natural scenes. We used machine learning techniques to train a bottom-up, top-down model of saliency based on 2D and depth features/cues. We found that models trained on Itti & Koch and depth features combined outperform models trained on other individual features (i.e. only Gabor filter responses or only depth features), or trained on combination of these features. As a consequence, depth features combined with Itti & Koch features improve the prediction of gaze locations. This first characterization of using joint luminance and depth features is an important step towards developing models of eye movements, which operate well under natural conditions such as those encountered in HCI settings.

TI  - Gaze analysis of user characteristics in magazine style narrative visualizations
JO  - User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction
AB  - Previous research has shown that various user characteristics (e.g., cognitive abilities, personality traits, and learning abilities) can influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These findings have prompted researchers to investigate user-adaptive information visualizations that can help users by providing personalized support based on their specific needs. Whereas existing work has been mostly limited to tasks involving just visualizations, the aim of our research is to broaden this work to include scenarios where users process textual documents with embedded visualizations, i.e., Magazine Style Narrative Visualizations, or MSNVs for short. In this paper, we analyze eye tracking data collected from a user study with MSNVs to uncover processing behaviors that are negatively impacting user experience (i.e., time on task) for users with low abilities in these user characteristics. Our analysis leverages Linear Mixed-Effects Models to evaluate the relationships among user characteristics, gaze processing behaviors, and task performance. Our results identify several MSNV processing behaviors within the visualization that contribute to poor task performance for users with low reading proficiency. For instance, we identify that users with low reading proficiency transition significantly more often compared to their counterparts between relevant and non-relevant bars, and transition more often from bars to the labels. We present our findings as a step toward designing user-adaptive support mechanisms to alleviate these difficulties with MSNVs, and provide suggestions on how our results can be leveraged for creating a set of meaningful interventions for future evaluation (e.g., dynamically highlighting relevant bars and labels in the visualization to help users with low reading proficiency locate them more effectively).

We are also addressing issues relating to the use of gaze as the main interaction input modality. We have designed and developed two operational user interfaces: one for providing motor-disabled users with easy gaze-based access to map applications and graphical software; the other for iteratively testing and improving the usability of gaze-contingent displays.

AB  - The quality and availability of eye tracking equipment has been increasing while costs have been decreasing. These trends increase the possibility of using eye trackers for entertainment purposes. Games that can be controlled solely through movement of the eyes would be accessible to persons with decreased limb mobility or control. On the other hand, use of eye tracking can change the gaming experience for all players, by offering richer input and enabling attention-aware games. Eye tracking is not currently widely supported in gaming, and games specifically developed for use with an eye tracker are rare. This paper reviews past work on eye tracker gaming and charts future development possibilities in different sub-domains within. It argues that based on the user input requirements and gaming contexts, conventional computer games can be classified into groups that offer fundamentally different opportunities for eye tracker input. In addition to the inherent design issues, there are challenges and varying levels of support for eye tracker use in the technical implementations of the games.

JO  - Machine Vision and Applications
SP  - 267
EP  - 278
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
AB  - This paper investigates the recognition of the Eye Accessing Cues used in the Neuro-Linguistic Programming as a method for inferring one’s thinking mechanisms, since the meaning of non-visual gaze directions may be directly related to the internal mental processes. The direction of gaze is identified by separating the components of the eye (i.e., iris, sclera and surrounding skin) followed by retrieving the relative position of the iris within the eye bounding box that was previously extracted from an eye landmarks localizer. The eye cues are retrieved via a logistic classifier from features that describe the typical regions within the eye bounding box. The simultaneous investigation of both eyes, as well as the eye tracking over consecutive frames, are shown to increase the overall performance. The here proposed solution is tested on four databases proving to have superior performance when compared in terms of recognition rate with methods relying on state of the art algorithms.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 261
EP  - 272
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - This paper introduces the concept of enabling gaze-based interaction for users with high-level motor disabilities to control an avatar in a first-person perspective on-line community. An example community, Second Life, is introduced that could offer disabled users the same virtual freedom as any other user, and so allow disabled users to be able-bodied (should they wish) within the virtual world. A survey of the control demands for Second Life and a subsequent preliminary experiment show that gaze control has inherent problems particularly for locomotion and camera movement. These problems result in a lack of effective gaze control of Second Life, such that control is not practical and show that disabled users who interact using gaze will have difficulties in controlling Second Life (and similar environments). This suggests that these users could once again become disabled in the virtual world by the difficulties in effectively controlling their avatars, and their ‘disability privacy’, or the right to control an avatar as effectively as an able bodied user, and so appear virtually able bodied, will be compromised. Methods for overcoming these difficulties such as the use of gaze aware on-screen assistive tools could overcome these problems, but games manufacturers must design inclusively, so that disabled users may have the right to disability privacy in their Second (virtual) Lives.

JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 2861
EP  - 2889
VL  - 76
IS  - 2
AB  - In the recent years, the rapid increase of the volume of multimedia content has led to the development of several automatic annotation approaches. In parallel, the high availability of large amounts of user interaction data, revealed the need for developing automatic annotation techniques that exploit the implicit user feedback during interactive multimedia retrieval tasks. In this context, this paper proposes a method for automatic video annotation by exploiting implicit user feedback during interactive video retrieval, as this is expressed with gaze movements, mouse clicks and queries submitted to a content-based video search engine. We exploit this interaction data to represent video shots with feature vectors based on aggregated gaze movements. This information is used to train a classifier that can identify shots of interest for new users. Subsequently, we propose a framework that during testing: a) identifies topics (expressed by query clusters), for which new users are searching for, based on a novel clustering algorithm and b) associates multimedia data (i.e., video shots) to the identified topics using supervised classification. The novel clustering algorithm is based on random forests and is driven by two factors: first, by the distance measures between different sets of queries and second by the homogeneity of the shots viewed during each query cluster defined by the clustering procedure; this homogeneity is inferred from the performance of the gaze-based classifier on these shots. The evaluation shows that the use of aggregated gaze data can be exploited for video annotation purposes.

AB  - We describe a setup and experiments where users are checking and correcting image tags given by an automatic tagging system. We study how much the application of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) method speeds up the process of finding and correcting the erroneously-tagged images. We also analyze the use of implicit relevance feedback from the user’s gaze tracking patterns as a method for boosting up the CBIR performance. Finally, we use automatic speech recognition for giving the correct tags for those images that were wrongly tagged. The experiments show a large variance in the tagging task performance, which we believe is primarily caused by the users’ subjectivity in image contents as well as their varying familiarity with the gaze tracking and speech recognition setups. The results suggest potentials for gaze and/or speech enhanced CBIR method in image tagging, at least for some users.

CY  - Cham
AB  - To communicate one’s thinking precisely and to find proper solution in case of conflict, it is important to improve one’s thinking skills. Thinking skills are required to expose the root of conflict between one’s own thought process and that of others. To cultivate such a skill, a training tool that analyzes a person’s internal self-conversation by verbalizing their thought is proposed by [1]. If such a process can be interpreted in human-understandable levels, a system can judge whether the learner is thinking logically in the self-conversation or not. In this paper, we propose a system that traces the sequence of a user’s eye-gaze during his/her internal self-conversation process. The initial analysis based on the trainers’ correction process data for hospital nurses’ cases showed that our proposed system has the potential to interpret the context of a person’s metacognitive monitoring and control process.

To render a scene in real-time, the reverse-mapped z-buffer DOF simulation technique with the blurring method based on Poisson disk is used. We conduct perceptual experiments to test human impressions caused by simulation of the DOF phenomenon and to assess benefits of using eye tracker to control the DOF effect rendering in virtual environments. Additionally, we survey the eye tracking technologies suitable for virtual environments and preview techniques of the real time DOF rendering.

AB  - This paper describes an intelligent system that we developed to support affective multimodal human-computer interaction (AMM-HCI) where the user’s actions and emotions are modeled and then used to adapt the interaction and support the user in his or her activity. The proposed system, which we named Gaze-X, is based on sensing and interpretation of the human part of the computer’s context, known as W5+ (who, where, what, when, why, how). It integrates a number of natural human communicative modalities including speech, eye gaze direction, face and facial expression, and a number of standard HCI modalities like keystrokes, mouse movements, and active software identification, which, in turn, are fed into processes that provide decision making and adapt the HCI to support the user in his or her activity according to his or her preferences. A usability study conducted in an office scenario with a number of users indicates that Gaze-X is perceived as effective, easy to use, useful, and affectively qualitative.

TI  - Gaze-based interactions in the cockpit of the future: a survey
JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
AB  - Flying an aircraft is a mentally demanding task where pilots must process a vast amount of visual, auditory and vestibular information. They have to control the aircraft by pulling, pushing and turning different knobs and levers, while knowing that mistakes in doing so can have fatal outcomes. Therefore, attempts to improve and optimize these interactions should not increase pilots’ mental workload. By utilizing pilots’ visual attention, gaze-based interactions provide an unobtrusive solution to this. This research is the first to actively involve pilots in the exploration of gaze-based interactions in the cockpit. By distributing a survey among 20 active commercial aviation pilots working for an internationally operating airline, the paper investigates pilots’ perception and needs concerning gaze-based interactions. The results build the foundation for future research, because they not only reflect pilots’ attitudes towards this novel technology, but also provide an overview of situations in which pilots need gaze-based interactions.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this study, we developed a novel system, called Gaze2Segment, integrating biological and computer vision techniques to support radiologists’ reading experience with an automatic image segmentation task. During diagnostic assessment of lung CT scans, the radiologists’ gaze information were used to create a visual attention map. Next, this map was combined with a computer-derived saliency map, extracted from the gray-scale CT images. The visual attention map was used as an input for indicating roughly the location of a region of interest. With computer-derived saliency information, on the other hand, we aimed at finding foreground and background cues for the object of interest found in the previous step. These cues are used to initiate a seed-based delineation process. The proposed Gaze2Segment achieved a dice similarity coefficient of 86% and Hausdorff distance of 1.45 mm as a segmentation accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, Gaze2Segment is the first true integration of eye-tracking technology into a medical image segmentation task without the need for any further user-interaction.

AB  - In hub-satellite collaboration using video, interpreting gaze direction is critical for communication between hub coworkers sitting around a table and their remote satellite colleague. However, 2D video distorts images and makes this interpretation inaccurate. We present GazeLens, a video conferencing system that improves hub coworkers’ ability to interpret the satellite worker’s gaze. A $$360^{\circ }$$360∘camera captures the hub coworkers and a ceiling camera captures artifacts on the hub table. The system combines these two video feeds in an interface. Lens widgets strategically guide the satellite worker’s attention toward specific areas of her/his screen allow hub coworkers to clearly interpret her/his gaze direction. Our evaluation shows that GazeLens (1) increases hub coworkers’ overall gaze interpretation accuracy by $$25.8\%$$25.8%in comparison to a conventional video conferencing system, (2) especially for physical artifacts on the hub table, and (3) improves hub coworkers’ ability to distinguish between gazes toward people and artifacts. We discuss how screen space can be leveraged to improve gaze interpretation.

AB  - This paper provides evidence of individual difference on digital reading, by examining male/female and good/poor readers’ eye tracking records (including pupil, blinks, fixations, saccades, and regressions). From 6,520 undergraduate students’ university entrance exam scores and the follow-up reading assessments, we strategically selected 74 participants (half males and half females, top 3% good readers and bottom 3% poor readers) from different disciplines. Results indicated that the major differences between male and female readers were saccade duration, regression rate, and blink rate. Good and poor readers differ significantly in most of the eye tracking indicators, and the major effects of reading ability were more obvious than the gender effects. Among all the eight indicators examined in this study, blink and regression rates are most sensitive to gender attribute, while fixation rate and saccade amplitude presented least sensitiveness. These findings would be helpful for user modeling with eye-tracking data in intelligent tutoring systems.

AB  - One of the most confusing aspects that one meets as he introduces himself into gaze tracking is the variety, in terms of hardware equipment, of available systems providing solutions to the same matter, i.e. determining subject’s gaze. Calibration permits adjusting trackers based on different hardware and image features to the subject. The negative aspect of calibration is that it permits the system to work properly but at the expense of a lack of control over the intrinsic behavior of the tracker. The objective of this work is to overcome this obstacle to explore more deeply the elements of a tracker from a purely geometrical point of view. Alternative models based on image features are evaluated. As result of this study a model has been constructed based on minimal calibration using one camera and multiple lighting with acceptable accuracy level.

AB  - In this chapter we investigated which hand gestures are intuitive to control a large display multimedia interface from a user’s perspective. Over the course of two sequential user evaluations, we defined a simple gesture set that allows users to fully control a large display multimedia interface, intuitively. First, we evaluated numerous gesture possibilities for a set of commands that can be issued to the interface. These gestures were selected from literature, science fiction movies, and a previous exploratory study. Second, we implemented a working prototype with which the users could interact with both hands and the preferred hand gestures with 2D and 3D visualizations of biochemical structures. We found that the gestures are influenced to significant extent by the fast paced developments in multimedia interfaces such as the Apple iPhone and the Nintendo Wii and to no lesser degree by decades of experience with the more traditional WIMP-based interfaces.

EP  - 2864
VL  - 23
IS  - 5
AB  - A map is a data structure that is commonly used to store data as key–value pairs and retrieve data as keys, values, or key–value pairs. Although Java offers different map implementation classes, Android SDK offers other implementations supposed to be more efficient than HashMap: ArrayMap and SparseArray variants (SparseArray, LongSparseArray, SparseIntArray, SparseLongArray, and SparseBooleanArray). Yet, the performance of these implementations in terms of CPU time, memory usage, and energy consumption is lacking in the official Android documentation; although saving CPU, memory, and energy is a major concern of users wanting to increase battery life. Consequently, we study the use of map implementations by Android developers in two ways. First, we perform an observational study of 5713 Android apps in GitHub. Second, we conduct a survey to assess developers’ perspective on Java and Android map implementations. Then, we perform an experimental study comparing HashMap, ArrayMap, and SparseArray variants map implementations in terms of CPU time, memory usage, and energy consumption. We conclude with guidelines for choosing among the map implementations: HashMap is preferable over ArrayMap to improve energy efficiency of apps, and SparseArray variants should be used instead of HashMap and ArrayMap when keys are primitive types.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We address the deployment of perceptual attention to social interactions as displayed in conversational clips, when relying on multimodal information (audio and video). A probabilistic modelling framework is proposed that goes beyond the classic saliency paradigm while integrating multiple information cues. Attentional allocation is determined not just by stimulus-driven selection but, importantly, by social value as modulating the selection history of relevant multimodal items. Thus, the construction of attentional priority is the result of a sampling procedure conditioned on the potential value dynamics of socially relevant objects emerging moment to moment within the scene. Preliminary experiments on a publicly available dataset are presented.

JO  - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
SP  - 645
EP  - 659
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
AB  - There is an inextricable link between attention and learning, yet AIED systems in 2015 are largely blind to learners’ attentional states. We argue that next-generation AIED systems should have the ability to monitor and dynamically (re)direct attention in order to optimize allocation of sparse attentional resources. We present some initial ideas towards achieving this goal, starting with a 2 × 2 (direction of attention × content of thoughts) organizational framework that encapsulates a range of attentional states including overt inattention, covert inattention, zone outs, tune outs, and focused, alternating, and divided attention. We then sketch out a three component attentional computing architecture consisting of: (1) devices to monitor where attention appears to be directed; (2) mechanisms for real-time attentional state diagnosis; and (3) interventions to dynamically (re)direct attention. We describe two closed-loop attention-aware AIED systems to serve as concrete renditions of these ideas. We conclude by arguing that AIED can achieve the dual goals of advancing basic research on the science of learning while simultaneously developing highly-effective AIED systems by “attending to attention.”

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we consider the Pattern Recognition applied to paper documents based on the grammatical inference (GI) for classes of structured documents like summaries, dictionaries, bibliographic data basis, encyclopaedias and so on. In this task, the inference engine takes as input a set of individual examples of these documents and outputs a set of rules that recognise similar documents. We place GI in an algebraic framework in which rewrite rules will define the process of generalisation. The implementation algorithm discussed here is used in a current document handling project in which paper documents are typographically tagged and then recognised. One of the current applications in this project is to extract the physical and the logical structures of a given set of paper documents and then reorganise them in a machine readable form like HTML code.

SP  - 236

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Many eye-tracking studies have shown that visual attention patterns during diagram-based problem solving, measured by eye movements, reveal critical aspects of the problem solving process that traditional measures like solution time and accuracy cannot address. In our first experiment (n = 14), we use this method during the solution of a widely-studied high level reasoning problem, Duncker’s (1945) radiation problem, to show that differences in visual attention to a particular diagram feature corresponds with correctly solving the problem. We then extend these findings in a second experiment (n = 81) to evaluate cognitive sensitivity to perceptual changes in the diagram. We show that problem solvers are highly sensitive to the diagram structure, and that the shifts in attention that result from subtle perceptual changes in the diagram appear to have a dramatic positive effect on reasoning.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper briefly summarises our results on gaze guidance such as to complement the demonstrations that we plan to present at the workshop. Our goal is to integrate gaze into visual communication systems by measuring and guiding eye movements. Our strategy is to predict a set of about ten salient locations and then change the probability for one of these candidates to be attended: for one candidate the probability is increased, for the others it is decreased. To increase saliency, in our current implementation, we show a natural-scene movie and overlay red dots very briefly such that they are hardly perceived consciously. To decrease the probability, for example, we locally reduce the temporal frequency content of the movie. We here present preliminary results, which show that the three steps of our above strategy are feasible. The long-term goal is to find the optimal real-time video transformation that minimises the difference between the actual and the desired eye movements without being obtrusive. Applications are in the area of vision-based communication, augmented vision, and learning.

AB  - Within the HILAS flight deck strand a flight simulator experiment was performed. It was the first experiment of a series of two. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate a set of Human Factors tools (toolbox) for measurement of HCI aspects when new technologies are installed on a flight deck. This paper is an informative document that describes the tools and technologies that were applied in that first experiment. The lessons that will be identified from this experiment will be the input for a better and improved Human Factors toolbox which will be evaluated in the second experiment. Eventually this toolbox may be used by authorities and industry as a structured way of measuring HCI aspects of new technologies and applications that may be installed in future flight decks and as such may also be used as a HF certification instrument.

AB  - This paper presents perspectives from both academia and practice on how an HCI testing is to be conducted and the deliberations that go into the testing. HCI testing can be conducted in closed-door laboratory or in a field setting. While there is an increased interest in field testing of an HCI artifact, there is always an enduring concern over how to administer a field testing given that the testers will have less control over the course of testing. In this paper, we cover HCI testing deliberation as well as the operational issues of field testing, and conclude the paper with an exemplary case of a large-scale field testing conducted in Taiwan.

We examined attention distribution from novice to advanced drivers and a visual experiment was conducted using stickers and camera to both quantify and qualify attention while participants were in a simulation auto-driving scenario. Thus, an consciousness hot-map could be determined by stickers’ distribution and eye-tracking data, which could contribute to interface design and its structure in autonomous driving vehicles.

AB  - Whilst much effort is being invested into the design of human-computer interfaces that provide users with access to large amounts of information, there is less understanding of how human performance can be optimized in such interaction-driven contexts. We suggest one way to improve performance is to tailor the structure of the interface to the adaptive nature of cognition and orient behavior towards certain strategies, and away from others. Here, we show how small changes in Information Access Cost (IAC) - the time, physical and mental cost of accessing information - can effect powerful changes in cognitive processing strategies that subsequently affect performance. Increasing IAC on task-critical information was generally shown to encourage a more ‘memory-intensive’ processing strategy. This strategy not only improved future memory for task-relevant information, but also improved learning during problem solving, and planning. Implications for display designers in HCI are discussed.

CY  - Cham
AB  - We introduce eye tracking features including existing features like (1) scan path and (2) heat map, and novel features including (1) components of scan path and (2) peaks of heat to better define and understand human vision. In this paper, these features are used to describe the eye movements of a person when he/she is watching an image and looking for the target object in it. Based on these features, a new image complexity called eye tracking complexity is defined. Eye tracking complexity can be computed either by carrying out eye tracking experiments and extracting eye tracking features or through a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is introduced in this paper. This CNN computes eye tracking complexity directly from images. It has been validated that eye tracking complexity of an image corresponds to the detection algorithms average precision over an image. Thus, eye tracking complexity can be used to predict the hardness of object detection, which can yield guidelines for the hierarchical algorithms design.

We discuss several possibilities of extracting features from the eye-movement patterns of annotators and injecting them in popular NLP frameworks. We show that features derived from such forms of cognitive data (referred to as cognition-driven features or cognitive features), when augmented with traditional linguistic features used for well-known supervised machine learning-based NLP systems, improve the performance of such systems. We stick to the tasks of sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection—two well-known problems in text classification.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new approach to determine the head pose which is a very important issue in several new applications. Our method consists of building a synthetic image database for a dense set of pose parameter values. This can be done with only one real image of the face using the Candide-3 model. To determine the pose, we compare each synthesized face image to the current image using an Hausdorff-like distance applied to gradient orientation features. Experimental results show the efficiency of our approach on real images. The improvement is also proved through a comparison with other technique presented in literature.

The collected corpus comprises 78 minutes in four interactions. Using automated techniques to record head pose and speech patterns, we analyze head pose patterns in turn-transitions. We find that introduction of objects makes addressee identification based on head pose more challenging. The symmetrical setup also allows us to compare human-human to human-robot behavior within the same interaction. We argue that this symmetry can be used to assess to what extent the system exhibits a human-like behavior.

One issue with reading on computers is that user’s hands are often occupied in turning pages, which prevents them from performing certain tasks well. It is possible to free user’s hands from physical input devices by designing new input methods. We present a prototype system that uses a camera to monitor user’s head, and when the user makes head gestures, the system helps the user turn pages on the currently active document. We evaluate the usability of our system through experiment and questionnaire. Feedback from users indicates that our system is helpful in hand-occupying situations.

AB  - E-textbooks are often considered as having several advantages over printed textbooks. However, research shows conflicting results regarding school learners’ satisfaction with e-textbooks. In South Africa a particular e-book platform, EduBook for e-textbooks, is currently used in 170 schools across the country. In this study the satisfaction and continuance intention of 10 learners from a South African high school where cross-subject implementation of the EduBook platform was piloted, were considered. In this mixed method study, a control group of 7 non e-textbooks users from other schools were used to compare the findings. Guided by the adapted ECM model of Baker-Eveleth and Stone (2015), quantitative data was collected through eye tracking tests and qualitative data was collected through individual interviews and a focus group discussion. The findings confirm the influence of usability, expectations and perceived usefulness on satisfaction and continuance intention to use the e-textbook platform. In addition, it highlights post-adoption expectations created by cross-subject implementation and its influence on learners’ satisfaction. The important role played by the way in which teachers use the platform is emphasised and learners provided useful suggestions on how teachers can be prepared and assisted in the use of the platform.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This research proposes 3D graphical agents in the role of virtual presenters with a new type of functionality – the capability to process and respond to visual attention of users communicated by their eye movements. Eye gaze is an excellent clue to users’ attention, visual interest, and visual preference. Using state-of-the-art non-contact eye tracking technology, eye movements can be assessed in a unobtrusive way. By analyzing and interpreting eye behavior in real-time, our proposed system can adapt to the current (visual) interest state of the user, and thus provide a more personalized, context-aware, and ‘attentive’ experience of the presentation. The system implements a virtual presentation room, where research content of our institute is presented by a team of two highly realistic 3D agents in a dynamic and interactive way. A small preliminary study was conducted to investigate users’ gaze behavior with a non-interactive version of the system. A demo video based on our system was awarded as the best application of life-like agents at the GALA event in 2006.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Automatic recognition of facial expression is a necessary step toward the design of more natural human-computer interaction systems. This work presents a user-independent approach for the recognition of facial expressions from image sequences. The faces are normalized in scale and rotation based on the eye centers’ locations into tracks from which we extract features representing shape and motion. Classification and localization of the center of the expression in the video sequences are performed using a Hough transform voting method based on randomized forests. We tested our approach on two publicly available databases and achieved encouraging results comparable to the state of the art.

TI  - How Do Sponsored Search Results Affect User Behavior in Web Search?
BT  - Information Retrieval Technology
SP  - 73
EP  - 85
PB  - Springer International Publishing

AB  - Sponsored search has gained considerable attention in Web search-related studies. In this paper, we investigate into the user interaction process on search engine result pages (SERPs) considering the influence of sponsored search results. We integrate different styles of sponsored links into SERPs to systematically study how they affect users’ behavioral preferences. Based on an analysis into users’ eye movements and click-through behavior, we showed that different presentation styles among sponsored links might lead to different behavior biases, not only for the sponsored search results but also for the organic ones. We also showed that search task type might influence the click-through of sponsored links, whereas this factor has little effect on the visual attention that users devote to top sponsored results. Interestingly, it seems that user satisfaction, which was intuitively measured by participants, was unaffected by the different sponsored search result appearances. These results help us better understand how users interact with search engines and how we can improve the placement of sponsored search results on SERPs.

TI  - How Do Viewers Spontaneously Segment Animated Diagrams of Mechanical and Biological Subject Matter?
BT  - Diagrammatic Representation and Inference
SP  - 337
EP  - 339
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - A challenges for learning from animated diagrams is to first parse the continuous flow of information into discrete event units. Inadequacies in this parsing process can prejudice the quality of the mental model constructed from the depiction. One approach that has been proposed for ameliorating such problems is for the designer to pre-segment the animation. However, the pre-segmentation techniques used tend to be either intuitive or based on an expert’s understanding of the subject matter. Neither of these approaches takes proper account of the psychological processing that must occur for an external animation to be properly internalized. This poster reports a study of the processes that learners spontaneously use when asked to segment whole animations into events. It compared segmentation of two contrasting diagram types, one representing a mechanical system and the other a biological system. The number of events identified was low relative to the number that were actually present. There were deficiencies in participants’ placement of event boundaries and in their characterization of inter-event relationships. Identification of events in the mechanical system proceeded from micro to macro, this order was reversed with the biological system.

TI  - How Do We Read Specifications? Experiences from an Eye Tracking Study
BT  - Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality
SP  - 301
EP  - 317
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - [Context and motivation] Writing good specifications is difficult and takes time. There are several guidelines such as the Volere template to assist writing a good specification. They provide a table of contents which can be used like a checklist to consider all relevant aspects. Voluminous specifications take more time to write, and also more time to read. A larger specification is not always a better one. [Question/Problem] A requirements engineer should be aware of how readers make use of a specification and consider their interests in writing it. In addition, some people prefer reading on a screen while others hold a preference for paper printouts. Some parts or aspects may be read differently in both representations. [Principal ideas/results]: We have conducted an Eye Tracking study investigating how specifications are read. We compared paper-based with on-screen presentation, and different reading perspectives such as UI designers, tester, software architects etc. We derived study goals by using GQM down to the level of quantitative and statistical eye tracking analyses. [Contribution]: There is a two-fold contribution: (a) Observations and findings about the way specifications are read; e.g., we had expected paper-based reading to be faster. Instead, we found similar reading patterns on paper versus on screen. (b) Insights with respect to eye tracking as a research method for requirements engineering. We discuss strengths and shortcomings, and provide lessons learned.

BT  - Handbook of Human Centric Visualization
SP  - 623
EP  - 650
PB  - Springer New York
CY  - New York, NY
AB  - In recent years, the analysis of dynamic network data has become an increasingly prominent research issue. While several visual analytics techniques with the focus on the examination of temporal evolving networks have been proposed in recent years, their effectiveness and utility for end users need to be further analyzed. When dealing with techniques for dynamic network analysis, which integrate visual, computational, and interactive components, users become easily overwhelmed by the amount of information displayed—even in case of small sized networks. Therefore we evaluated visual analytics techniques for dynamic networks during their development, performing intermediate evaluations by means of mock-up and eye-tracking studies and a final evaluation of the running interactive prototype, traceing three pathways of development in detail: The first one focused on the maintenance of the user’s mental map throughout changes of network structure over time, changes caused by user interactions, and changes of analytical perspectives. The second one addresses the avoidance of visual clutter, or at least its moderation. The third pathway of development follows the implications of unexpected user behaviour and multiple problem solving processes. Aside from presenting solutions based on the outcomes of our evaluation, we discuss open and upcoming problems and set out new research questions.

AB  - This study aims to compare the user experiences in a web search context. Within the scope of the study, 15 voluntary students participated in the sessions in a fully equipped human-computer interaction laboratory. Two different tasks were assigned, which varied in the context: everyday vs. academic. There was no time limitation to complete the tasks. All sessions were recorded by Tobii software, which allowed recording eye movements. Collected data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings suggest that searching for everyday content can be less complicated than that for academic content. Participants shared some common beliefs for the everyday content. They trusted a website including real travelers’ reviews, and do not need to visit any other website, but for academic task, they first judged the seriousness of the website. They did not prefer to visit blogs, wikis, or news web sites while they were looking for academic information.

SP  - 1
EP  - 28
VL  - 29
IS  - 1
AB  - The goal of this study was to use eye-tracking and log-file data to investigate the impact of prior knowledge on college students’ (N = 194, with a subset of n = 30 for eye tracking and sequence mining analyses) fixations on (i.e., looking at) self-regulated learning-related areas of interest (i.e., specific locations on the interface) and on the sequences of engaging in cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning processes during learning with MetaTutor, an Intelligent Tutoring System that teaches students about the human circulatory system. Results revealed that there were no significant differences in fixations on single areas of interest by the prior knowledge group students were assigned to; however there were significant differences in fixations on pairs of areas of interest, as evidenced by eye-tracking data. Furthermore, there were significant differences in sequential patterns of engaging in cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning processes by students’ prior knowledge group, as evidenced from log-file data. Specifically, students with high prior knowledge engaged in processes containing cognitive strategies and metacognitive strategies whereas students with low prior knowledge did not. These results have implications for designing adaptive intelligent tutoring systems that provide individualized scaffolding and feedback based on individual differences, such as levels of prior knowledge.

AB  - Recent developments in controlled natural language editors for knowledge engineering (KE) have given rise to expectations that they will make KE tasks more accessible and perhaps even enable non-engineers to build knowledge bases. This exploratory research focussed on novices and experts in knowledge engineering during their attempts to learn a controlled natural language (CNL) known as OWL Simplified English and use it to build a small knowledge base. Participants’ behaviours during the task were observed through eye-tracking and screen recordings.

SP  - 9

PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - Joint attention is critical for effective communication and learning during shared reading. There is a potential disassociation of attention when the adult reads texts while the child looks at pictures. We hypothesize the lack of joint attention limits children’s opportunity to learn print words. Traditional research paradigm does not measure joint attention in real-time. In the current study, three experiments were conducted to monitor parent-child joint attention in shared storybook reading. We simultaneously tracked eye movements of a parent and his/her child with two eye-trackers. We also provided real-time eye gaze feedback to the parent about where the child was looking at, and vice versa. Changes of dyads’ reading behaviors before and after the intervention were measured from both eye movements and video records. Baseline data showed little joint attention in the naturalistic parent-child shared reading. The real-time eye gaze feedback significantly increased parent-child joint attention and improved children’s learning.

AB  - In our experiment, we studied the searching sequence of humans, i.e. how humans solve the game tree. We created a controlled environment of maze game to simulate the situation where the player is not allowed to observe the entire map freely. We use “fog-block” to cover the intersection of a maze. Thus, the maze becomes an “imperfect information maze.” We give additional information to hint on the path that the player should choose. Then we observed the change in players’ behavior. We found that hints affect searches making it best fit path towards hint.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper describes the pilot study that attempts to analyze the difference in learners’ behavior of reading multimedia learning materials by our program. Learners with different cognitive styles characterized as verbalizers and visualizers were assigned to read the materials about cooking science with their eye movement recorded, and analyzed. An alternative strategy of visualization to integrate the instructional message with the temporal and spatial data in a single diagram is attempted and testified in this pilot study. As the result, it is observed that the gaze of the verbalizers mainly moves back and forth among the paragraph areas constituted mainly by text of each page whereas the visualizers frequently check pictures referenced by some text, yet figure legends are more read by verbalizers. Preliminary findings from the pilot study provide data presentation and interpretation in better granularity, and support that learners’ cognitive styles affect their decisions of orders, emphasis, and repetition to read text and pictures.

AB  - We present an empirical study using eye tracking equipment to understand how novices read source code in the context of two introductory programming classes. Our main goal is to begin to understand how novices read source code and to determine if we see any improvement in program comprehension as the course progresses. The results indicate that novices put in more effort and had more difficulty reading source code as they progress through the course. However, they are able to partially comprehend code at a later point in the course. The relationship between fixation counts and durations is linear but shows more clusters later in the course, indicating groups of students that learned at the same pace. The results also show that we did not see any significant shift in learning (indicated by the eye tracking metrics) during the course, indicating that there might be more than one course that needs to be taken over the course of a few years to realize the significance of the shift. We call for more studies over a student’s undergraduate years to further learn about this shift.

EP  - 265
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - With the widespread emergence of “feed” in mobile Internet products, their competition for users and their usage time has become increasingly fierce, which makes improving the feed reading experience important. This research focuses on the news feed of Chinese news applications (apps) and attempts to provide an integrated picture of user experience with mobile news feed. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first stage, we explored users’ demands on mobile news feed and extracted important factors affecting users’ preference for products through in-depth interviews. Excluding the influence of news contents, the graphic layout and image quality, ancillary information, and template combination play important roles in users’ preference for products. On this basis, the template combination was further studied with an eye-tracking experiment. Results of eye-tracking data and subjective evaluation of six combinations show that templates and their combination influence users’ browsing behaviors and their subjective evaluation. It is a good choice to combine large-picture template with consecutive single-picture templates or consecutive three-picture ones since it can be well integrated. When consecutive three-picture templates work with one single-picture template, the score on users’ satisfaction of “good organization” is low, and the single-picture template is more likely to be ignored by the user, which greatly weakens the value of this piece of news. The research results provide design suggestions for the news feed of mobile news apps.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between semantic processing of words and modifications in pupil size. Variations in pupil diameter reflect cognitive processing, as has been widely demonstrated in literature. We designed an experiment in which semantic association between words was manipulated in order to disclose potential differences in cognitive processing. Moreover, we measured the concurrent pupil diameter changes. Results showed faster pupil dilation in trials in which words were semantically associated. As changes in pupil diameter do not occur under voluntary control, they could reflect processing of preconscious information. We believe that a better symbiotic relationship between humans and machines is achievable once systems are able to make us aware of these “involuntary” changes.

The participants tried to find the misspelled words in the texts, during the data collection there was no time limitation. Participants’ eye movements were recorded by Tobii 1750 eye tracker device. The data were analyzed according to the accuracy and eye behavior metrics. The findings showed that participants read from sans serif typeface faster and more accurate than serif typeface. The findings suggest that participants fixated on the misspelled words more on serif typeface than sans serif typeface, in terms of the total visit duration participants spent more time on serif typeface than sans serif typeface.

Eye-gaze data were analyzed to examine where users focus their attention when reading privacy policies and searching for information in them. Overall, participants showed poor comprehension of the information conveyed in the privacy policies even though they were written at the participants’ level of education. When searching for information in the privacy policies, participants relied on the listing of individual sections provided at the beginning of a privacy policy, when available. When the listing of sections was not available, participants skimmed the entire policy, examining the headings and first few words of each paragraph to determine whether the sections or paragraphs were likely to contain the information for which they were searching.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Query suggestion (or recommendation) has become an important technique in commercial search engines (e.g., Google, Bing and Baidu) in order to improve users’ search experience. Most existing studies on query suggestion focus on formalizing various query suggestion models, while ignoring the study on investigating how users select query suggestions under different satisfaction states. Specifically, although a number of effective query suggestion models have been proposed, some basic problems have not been well investigated. For example, (i) how much the importance of query suggestion feature for users with respect to different queries; (ii) how user’s satisfaction for current search results will influence the selection of query suggestions. In this paper, we conduct extensive user study with a search engine interface in order to investigate above problems. Through the user study, we gain a series of insightful findings which may benefit for the design of future search engine and query suggestion models.

AB  - It is exciting to witness the fast development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging which opens the door to many new applications. In view of developing rich and efficient services, we wonder which strategy should be adopted to predict salience in UAV videos. To that end, we introduce here a benchmark of off-the-shelf state-of-the-art models for saliency prediction. This benchmark monitors two challenging aspects related to salience, namely the peculiar characteristics of UAV contents and the temporal dimension of videos. This paper enables to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current static, dynamic, supervised and unsupervised models for drone videos. Eventually, we highlight several strategies for the development of visual attention in UAV videos.

TI  - How do measures of cognitive effort relate to each other? A multivariate analysis of post-editing process data
JO  - Machine Translation
SP  - 41
EP  - 62
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
AB  - There has been growing interest of late in the cognitive effort required by post-editing of machine translation. Compared to number of editing operations, cognitive (or mental) effort is frequently considered a more decisive indicator of the overall effort expended by post-editors. Estimating cognitive effort is not straightforward, however. Previous studies often triangulate different measures to obtain a consensus, but little post-editing research to date has attempted to show how measures of cognitive effort relate to each other in a multivariate analysis. This paper addresses this by presenting an exploratory comparison of cognitive measures based on eye tracking, pauses, editing time, and subjective ratings collected in a post-editing task carried out by professional and non-professional participants. All measures correlated with each other, but a principal components analysis showed that the measures cluster together in different ways. In particular, measures that increase with task time alone behaved differently from the others, with higher mutual associations and higher reliability. Regarding differences between professional and non-professional participants, it was observed that subjective ratings were overall more strongly associated with objective measures in the case of professionals. Surprising findings from previous research based on pause ratio are discussed. The paper argues that a pause typology will benefit the study of pause lengths and cognitive effort in post-editing.

JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 307
EP  - 320
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
AB  - It is well known that many Web pages are difficult to use for visually disabled people. Without access to a rich visual display, the intended structure and organisation of the page is obscured. To fully understand what is missing from the experience of visually disabled users, it is pertinent to ask how the presentation of Web pages on a standard display makes them easier for sighted people to use. This paper reports on an exploratory eye tracking study that addresses this issue by investigating how sighted readers use the presentation of the BBC News Web page to search for a link. The standard page presentation is compared with a “text-only” version, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that the removal of the intended presentation alters “reading” behaviours. The demonstration that the presentation of information assists task completion suggests that it should be re-introduced to non-visual presentations if the Web is to become more accessible. The conducted study also explored the extent to which algorithms that generate maps of what is perceptually salient on a page match the gaze data recorded in the eye tracking study. The correspondence between a page’s presentation, knowledge of what is visually salient, and how people use these features to complete a task might offer an opportunity to re-model a Web page to maximise access to its most important parts.

TI  - How programmers read regular code: a controlled experiment using eye tracking
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1440
EP  - 1477
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - Regular code, which includes repetitions of the same basic pattern, has been shown to have an effect on code comprehension: a regular function can be just as easy to comprehend as a non-regular one with the same functionality, despite being significantly longer and including more control constructs. It has been speculated that this effect is due to leveraging the understanding of the first instances to ease the understanding of repeated instances of the pattern. To verify and quantify this effect, we use eye tracking to measure the time and effort spent reading and understanding regular code. The experimental subjects were 18 students and 2 faculty members. The results are that time and effort invested in the initial code segments are indeed much larger than those spent on the later ones, and the decay in effort can be modeled by an exponential model. This shows that syntactic code complexity metrics (such as LOC and MCC) need to be made context-sensitive, e.g. by giving reduced weight to repeated segments according to their place in the sequence. However, it is not the case that repeated code segments are actually read more and more quickly. Rather, initial code segments receive more focus and are looked at more times, while later ones may be only skimmed. Further, a few recurring reading patterns have been identified, which together indicate that in general code reading is far from being purely linear, and exhibits significant variability across experimental subjects.

AB  - An eye movement study was conducted to study the visual factors which influencing the searching efficiency of bus stop board. 31 ordinary adults were measured to investigate the effects of the alignment patterns, the positions of the arrow indicating bus route direction on the searching efficiency of the different sexual passengers at different age stage by Eye-tracking. The eye movement experiment took the bus stop names as material, set simulated bus route, and made series of bus stop boards with different color combinations and graphic designs. The result shows that the difference in search time and fixation times between the positions of the direction arrow and the alignment patterns of the bus name list is significant. When the arrow was below of the bus stop name list, it cost much less time for distribute alignment bus stop boards than for top alignment ones in searching destination bus stop; and when the bus stop name list was in distribute alignment, those bus stop boards which the direction arrow was below the bus stop name list had a significant advantage over those that the arrow was above in searching time and fixation times. As a conclusion, the obtained results could be a reference for design the bus stop board.

AB  - This study evaluated the hypothesis that design aspects of the user interface of the applications and the capabilities and constraints of different mobile devices could affect mobile user experience in social network sites (SNS). For this purpose a qualitative mobile usability test, based on a multi-method approach, was carried out with a sample of 25 Turkish university students who were experienced mobile SNS users. The tests were conducted with two different smartphones: Iphone and Blackberry. The participants were observed during the task executions and additional data was collected by the “think aloud” procedure, eye-tracking and video recording of the participants. A short debriefing interview was also made to gain a detailed insight into the user experience. The findings revealed significant mobile usability problems caused specifically by the user interface features of the applications and limitations of each device and enable to propose guidelines to improve user experience in mobile SNS.

AB  - Advanced information visualisation systems offer many different forms of interaction. Nevertheless, we do not know how useful these interactions are. Researchers have suggested to develop a science of interaction. In this paper we discuss which research methods might be appropriate to study interaction with information visualisation systems. We suggest that thinking aloud, log files and eye tracking are promising candidates. These methods enable researchers to study interaction in more detail than other methods. All these methods have strengths and weaknesses. A combination of two or three of these methods might help to overcome the weaknesses.

AB  - Most cell phones today can receive and display video content. Nonetheless, we are still significantly behind the point where premium made for mobile content is mainstream, largely available, and affordable. Significant issues must be overcome. The small screen size is one of them. Indeed, the direct transfer of conventional contents (i.e. not specifically shot for mobile devices) will provide a video in which the main characters or objects of interest may become indistinguishable from the rest of the scene. Therefore, it is required to retarget the content. Different solutions exist, either based on distortion of the image, on removal of redundant areas, or cropping. The most efficient ones are based on dynamic adaptation of the cropping window. They significantly improve the viewing experience by zooming in the regions of interest. Currently, there is no common agreement on how to compare different solutions. A retargeting metric is proposed in order to gauge its quality. Eye-tracking experiments, zooming effect through coverage ratio and temporal consistency are introduced and discussed.

Both methods help to understand and to chart not only the usability of different websites but also the affective imp ressions associated with the websites. In this study, an Experimental and a Control-group were tested to assess the usability of the site and the emotional re actions to it. The results reveal that the Hungarian government website is too complicated, dull and difficult to apprehend at a glance.

VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - The presentation of a text has a significant effect on the reading speed of people with dyslexia. This paper presents a set of recommendations to customize texts on a computer screen in a more accessible way for this target group. This set is based on an eye tracking study with 92 people, 46 with dyslexia and 46 as control group, where the reading performance of the participants was measured . The following parameters were studied: color combinations for the font and the screen background, font size, column width as well as character, line and paragraph spacings. It was found that larger text and larger character spacings lead the participants with and without dyslexia to read significantly faster . The study is complemented with questionnaires to obtain the participants’ preferences for each of these parameters, finding other significant effects. These results provide evidence that people with dyslexia may benefit from specific text presentation parameters that make text on a screen more readable. So far, these recommendations based on eye tracking data are the most complete for people with dyslexia.

AB  - A widely accepted prediction is that computing will move to the background, weaving itself into the fabric of our everyday living spaces and projecting the human user into the foreground. If this prediction is to come true, then next generation computing should be about anticipatory user interfaces that should be human-centered, built for humans based on human models. They should transcend the traditional keyboard and mouse to include natural, human-like interactive functions including understanding and emulating certain human behaviors such as affecti0ve and social signaling. This article discusses how far are we from enabling computers to understand human behavior.

AB  - An understanding of gaze control requires knowledge of the basic properties of eye movements during scene viewing. Because most of what we know about eye movement behavior is based on the viewing of images on computer screens, it is important to determine whether viewing in this setting generalizes to the viewing of real-world environments. Our objectives were to characterize eye movement behavior in the real world using head-mounted eyetracking technology and to illustrate the need for and development of automated analytic methods. Eye movements were monitored while participants searched for and counted coffee cups positioned within a cluttered office scene. Saccades were longer than typically observed using static displays, but fixation durations appear to generalize across viewing situations. Participants also made longer saccades to cups when a pictorial example of the target was provided in advance, suggesting a modulation of the perceptual span in accordance with the amount of information provided.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new human implicit intent understanding model based on multi-modal information, which is a combination of eye movement data and brain wave signal obtained from eye-tracker and Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors respectively. From the eye movement data, we extract human implicit intention related to features such as fixation count and fixation duration corresponding to the areas of interest (AOI). Also, we analyze the EEG signals based on phase synchrony method. Combining the eye movement and EEG information, we train several classifiers such as support vector machine classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model and Naïve Bayesian, which can successfully identify the human’s implicit intention into two defined categories, i.e. navigational and informational intentions. Experimental results show that the human implicit intention can be better understood using multimodal information.

Technologies such as fNIR could provide additional performance metrics directly from brain-based measures to assess safety and performance of operators in high-risk fields. This paper reports a case study utilizing a continuous wave fNIR technology deployed in a real-time air traffic control (ATC) setting to evaluate the cognitive workload of certified professional controllers (CPCs) during the deployment of one of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Next Generation (NextGen) technologies.

AB  - Since the early days of aviation, aircraft design engineers have been using automation to reduce pilot workload and enhance flight safety. While the basic automated systems performed quite simple tasks such as to hold altitude or heading, modern flight guidance and control systems typically have over 20 different modes of operation. The basic philosophy of flight mode annunciation however, did hardly change. It is therefore not surprising that flight crews encounter more and more difficulties to comprehend the active flight mode. In current designs, the active flight mode is typically shown on top of the primary flight display (PFD). A new flight mode annunciation (FMA) concept was investigated using a flight simulator in conjunction with eye-tracking analysis and a questionnaire. The experiment involved 20 participants, aged between 22 and 47 years (M = 27.7, SD = 7). Thereof 12 were qualified pilots and 8 were aerospace engineering professionals. Flight experience reached from 0 to 11000 h (M = 946, SD = 2567). The study showed that the modified display style caused a significant decrease of fixation duration and subjective workload.

Attention is particularly relevant both in a multi-motion scene and in social interactions, when it comes to select and discern why and what to focus on. The first crucial role of attention concerns the saliency of human motion within a scene where other dynamics might occur. The second role, in social-close interactions, is highlighted by the selectivity shown towards gesture modalities both in peripheral and central vision. Experiments for both modeling and testing have been based on a dynamic 3D gaze tracker.

AB  - Humans are poor at detecting deception under the best conditions. The need for having a decision support system that can be a baseline for data-driven decision making is obvious. Such a system is not biased like humans are, and these often subconscious human biases can impair people’s judgment. A system for helping people at border security (CBP) is the AVATAR. The AVATAR, an Embodied Conversational agent (ECA), is implemented as a self-service kiosk. Our research uses this AVATAR as the baseline and we plan to augment the automated credibility assessment task that the AVATAR performs using a Humanoid robot. We will be taking advantage of humanoid robots’ capability of realistic dialogue and nonverbal gesturing. We are also capturing data from various sensors like microphones, cameras and an eye tracker that will help in model building and testing for the task of deception detection. We plan to carry out an experiment where we compare the results of an interview with the AVATAR and an interview with a humanoid robot. Such a comparative analysis has never been done before, hence we are very eager to conduct such a social experiment.

AB  - This paper describes the robust reading competitions for ICDAR 2003. With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term ‘robust reading’ to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems.

AB  - Mathematical user interfaces for authoring, collaboration, problem-solving and reasoning invariably rely on the ability to read, write and manipulate complex mathematical expressions. However, very little research has been done on how people read mathematical expressions, let alone how they are understood by the mind. One technique which researchers use to gain insight into how people read and comprehend symbols and complex phenomena are studies using eye-tracking hardware: focus on, and tracking of, pupils in order to determine the reader’s attention and fixation. In this paper we will explore the results of a study on two classes of students: mathematically “expert” (mathematical sciences students) and non-expert (Faculty of Science majors from outside the mathematical sciences). Each participant was presented with a series of mathematical problems (stimuli) and their eyes and attention/focus tracked as they worked through the problems mentally. We will discuss the differences in the two classes, both with respect to the correctness of responses to the problems and the structure of the scanning and identification of important components within the problem. This study has applications in mathematical software usability, accessibility, and design of interfaces, as comprehension of mathematical notation and formalism is assumed in the implementation of the modified symbolism inherent in structured mathematical software interfaces.

AB  - Older adults traditionally face major challenges at work when it comes to dealing with new technological tools. A sense of overwhelm and frustration can quickly arise under these circumstances. Continuous negative feelings in the work environment may lead to the increase of the risks for cognitive decline and threaten independence and quality of life. In this work, we focus on the seamless identification of frustration of older adults at work via physiological sensors embedded in an in-house developed computer mouse, denoted as CogniMouse. For the purpose of this research, we have developed a probabilistic classification algorithm that receives real-time signals and physiological measurement streams as input, and accordingly identifies frustration events. Ultimately, such classification can be leveraged to deliver user interventions and personalized solutions to help reduce user frustration.

AB  - We propose a novel approach for the identification of human implicit visual search intention based on eye movement patterns and pupillary analysis, in general, as well as pupil size, gradient of pupil size variation, fixation length and fixation count corresponding to areas of interest, and fixation count corresponding to non-areas of interest, in particular. The proposed model identifies human implicit visual search intention as task-free visual browsing or task-oriented visual search. Task-oriented visual search is further identified as task-oriented visual search intent generation, task-oriented visual search intent maintenance, or task-oriented visual search intent disappearance. During a visual search, measurement of the pupillary response is greatly influenced by external factors such the intensity and size of the visual stimulus. To alleviate the effects of external factors, we propose a robust baseline model that can accurately measure the pupillary response. Graphical representation of the measured parameter values shows significant differences among the different intent conditions, which can then be used as features for identification. By using the eye movement patterns and pupillary analysis, we can detect the transitions between different implicit intentions—task-free visual browsing intent to task-oriented visual search intent and task-oriented visual search intent maintenance to task-oriented visual search intent disappearance—using a hierarchical support vector machine. In the proposed model, the hierarchical support vector machine is able to identify the transitions between different intent conditions with greater than 90 % accuracy.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Assuming that eye tracking will be a common input device in the near future in notebooks and mobile devices like iPads, it is possible to implicitly gain information about images and image regions from these users’ gaze movements. In this paper, we investigate the principle idea of finding specific objects shown in images by looking at the users’ gaze path information only. We have analyzed 547 gaze paths from 20 subjects viewing different image-tag-pairs with the task to decide if the tag presented is actually found in the image or not. By analyzing the gaze paths, we are able to correctly identify 67% of the image regions and significantly outperform two baselines. In addition, we have investigated if different regions of the same image can be differentiated by the gaze information. Here, we are able to correctly identify two different regions in the same image with an accuracy of 38%.

TI  - Identifying Patterns in Eyetracking Scanpaths in Terms of Visual Elements of Web Pages
BT  - Web Engineering
SP  - 163
EP  - 180
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Web pages are typically decorated with different kinds of visual elements that help sighted people complete their tasks. Unfortunately, this is not the case for people accessing web pages in constraint environments such as visually disabled or small screen device users. In our previous work, we show that tracking the eye movements of sighted users provide good understanding of how people use these visual elements. We also show that people’s experience in constraint environments can be improved by reengineering web pages by using these visual elements. However, in order to reengineer web pages based on eyetracking, we first need to aggregate, analyse and understand how a group of people’s eyetracking data can be combined to create a common scanpath (namely, eye movement sequence) in terms of visual elements. This paper presents an algorithm that aims to achieve this. This algorithm was developed iteratively and experimentally evaluated with an eyetracking study. This study shows that the proposed algorithm is able to identify patterns in eyetracking scanpaths and it is fairly scalable. This study also shows that this algorithm can be improved by considering different techniques for pre-processing the data, by addressing the drawbacks of using the hierarchical structure and by taking into account the underlying cognitive processes.

SP  - 459
EP  - 473
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The objective of this study is to identify implicit psychophysiological pain points during an e-commerce interaction. In this article, we propose a method that allows to identify implicit pain points in the user’s experience, by targeting moments when the user has both a high level of arousal and a negative emotional valence, compared to his baseline state; which means that the user feels an intense negative emotion. Identifying those pain points and combining them with eye-tracking data gives key insights into the user journey and helps identify implicit pain points shared among users. It also allows to gain a deeper understanding of pain points that users may fail to identify during the post-task interview. Our results show that the temporal occurrence of psychophysical pain points can be accurately identified and that it is more reliable than pain points explicitly mentioned by users. This study contributes to the user experience literature and practice by proposing a reliable method to visualise peak emotional reactions experienced by users while performing a task. Thus, providing more precision and reliability in identifying pain points when compared to pain points mentioned by users after the task.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The goal of lossy image compression ought to be reducing entropy while preserving the perceptual quality of the image. Using gaze-tracked change detection experiments, we discover that human vision attends to one scale at a time. This evidence suggests that saliency should be treated on a per-scale basis, rather than aggregated into a single 2D map over all the scales. We develop a compression algorithm which adaptively reduces the entropy of the image according to its saliency map within each scale, using the Laplacian pyramid as both the multiscale decomposition and the saliency measure of the image. We finally return to psychophysics to evaluate our results. Surprisingly, images compressed using our method are sometimes judged to be better than the originals.

TI  - Image and Video Saliency Models Improvement by Blur Identification
BT  - Computer Vision and Graphics
SP  - 280
EP  - 287
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Visual saliency models aim at predicting where people look. In free viewing conditions, people look at relevant objects that are in focus. Assuming blurred or out-of-focus objects do not belong to the region of interest, this paper proposes a significant improvement and the validation of a saliency model by taking blur into account. Blur identification is associated to a spatio-temporal saliency model. Bottom-up models are designed to mimic the low-level processing of the human visual system and can thus detect out-of-focus objects as salient. The blur identification allows decreasing saliency values on blurred areas while increasing values on sharp areas. In order to validate our new saliency model we conducted eye-tracking experiments to record ground truth of observer’s fixations on images and videos. Blur identification significantly improves fixation prediction for natural images and videos.

TI  - Image quality assessment for inpainted images via learning to rank
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 1399
EP  - 1418
VL  - 78
IS  - 2
AB  - This paper proposes an image quality assessment (IQA) method for image inpainting, aiming at selecting the best one from a plurality of results. It is known that inpainting results vary largely with the method used for inpainting and the parameters set. Thus, in a typical use case, users need to manually select the inpainting method and the parameters that yield the best result. This manual selection takes a great deal of time and thus there is a great need for a way to automatically estimate the best result. Unlike existing IQA methods for inpainting, our method solves this problem as a learning-based ordering task between inpainted images. This approach makes it possible to introduce auto-generated training sets for more effective learning, which has been difficult for existing methods because judging inpainting quality is quite subjective. Our method focuses on the following three points: (1) the problem can be divided into a set of “pairwise preference order estimation” elemental problems, (2) this pairwise ordering approach enables a training set to be generated automatically, and (3) effective feature design is enabled by investigating actually measured human gazes for order estimation.

JO  - Science China Information Sciences
SP  - 1093
EP  - 1105
VL  - 55
IS  - 5
AB  - This paper presents a graphics processing unit (GPU) based stylization approach that preserves the fine structure between the original and the stylized images using gradient optimization. Existing abstraction and painterly stylization methods focused on contrast manipulation only, and thus the detailed salient structures of the input images are always destroyed when performing the current stylization techniques because of limitations like unavoidable salience information loss caused by contrast abstraction. We propose an image structure map to naturally model the fine structure existing in the original images. Gradient-based structure tangent generation and tangent-guided image morphology are used to construct the structure map. The image structure map, unlike an edge map, not only systematically models the boundary information within the imagery but also accentuates the underlying inner structure detail for further stylization. We facilitate the final stylization via parallel bilateral grid and structure-aware stylizing optimization on a GPU-CUDA platform in real time. In multiple experiments, the proposed method consistently demonstrates efficient and high quality image stylization performance.

TI  - Image visual attention computation and application via the learning of object attributes
JO  - Machine Vision and Applications
SP  - 1671
EP  - 1683
VL  - 25
IS  - 7
AB  - Visual attention aims at selecting a salient subset from the visual input for further processing while ignoring redundant data. The dominant view for the computation of visual attention is based on the assumption that bottom-up visual saliency such as local contrast and interest points drives the allocation of attention in scene viewing. However, we advocate in this paper that the deployment of attention is primarily and directly guided by objects and thus propose a novel framework to explore image visual attention via the learning of object attributes from eye-tracking data. We mainly aim to solve three problems: (1) the pixel-level visual attention computation (the saliency map); (2) the image-level visual attention computation; (3) the application of the computation model in image categorization. We first adopt the algorithm of object bank to acquire the responses to a number of object detectors at each location in an image and thus form a feature descriptor to indicate the occurrences of various objects at a pixel or in an image. Next, we integrate the inference of interesting objects from fixations in eye-tracking data with the competition among surrounding objects to solve the first problem. We further propose a computational model to solve the second problem and estimate the interestingness of each image via the mapping between object attributes and the inter-observer visual congruency obtained from eye-tracking data. Finally, we apply the proposed pixel-level visual attention model to the image categorization task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available benchmarks and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

We show in this paper that the magnitude of the gradient of an image obeys this law. We show, experimentally, that this also applies for the laplacian pyramid code. This yields to the field of entropy based coding which takes advantage of the a priori information about the probability of any symbol in the signal.

AB  - Devising new service ideas for information systems by deploying user-involvement approaches is a challenging task. The power of collective creation by involving users in designing systems has attracted attention; however, stakeholders with no design training face critical challenges in generating ideas. In this paper, by exemplifying our user-involvement method with game elements, ICT Service Design Game, in comparison with conventional brainstorming, we show the impact of constraints and rules in user-involvement methods when creating service concepts and specifications for information systems. The analysis is based on a comparative experiment on two design methods and shows that the constraints and rules of our game approach fostered innovative idea generation in spite of participants’ limited knowledge of and experience with design processes. Although our analysis is still in a preliminary stage, it indicates some positive impact of constraints and rules in design methods, especially when the methods are used by non-design professionals.

AB  - By training participants to use map-first mental rotation as their primary strategy on absolute navigational task, this study focused on how integration of heading information (from the exocentric reference frame) with target position information (from the egocentric reference frame) affects absolute direction judgments. Comparing with previous studies, the results in this study showed (1) response was not better for north than for south, (2) response was the slowest for back position in canonical position condition, and (3) the cardinal direction advantage of right-back position was not impaired. Eye movement data supported these conclusions partially, and should be cautious to use for similar goals. These findings can be applied to navigational training and interfaces design such as electric space.

VL  - 25

AB  - We-awareness is the socially recursive inferences that let collaborators know that all are mutually aware of each other’s awareness. While we-awareness is easy afforded in face to face collocated collaboration, it is much more difficult to design distributed groupware tools to provide equivalent capabilities: there can be no awareness unless it is programmed in via system features. We identify a series of questions that must be considered if we-awareness is to be supported. What types of awareness information is crucial and should thus be added to the ‘blank slate’ of a screen sharing system? How can that awareness information be captured through technology, and what information will be lost during this capture process? How should that information be translated, transformed and encoded into a digital form, and—as part of that—what information will be altered as part of that translation process? How will that information be transmitted, and what are the network effects in terms of that information being received in a timely manner? How will that information be represented to other participants in order to enable the rich and subtle interactions that occur in the face-to-face setting? We illustrate the nuances of these questions and why they are difficult to answer by revisiting several prior technical solutions to we-awareness.

AB  - Humans vary in their learning behaviour. It is difficult to predict the actual needs of learners through their search activity. It is also difficult to predict accurately the level of satisfaction after the learner finds a perceived relevant document. This research is a preliminary study to examine the predictive strength of some implicit indicators on web documents. An automated study was carried out and 13 participants were given 15 short documents to read and rate according to their perception of relevance to a given topic area. An investigation was carried out to examine if there exists a correlation between user generated implicit indicators and the explicit ratings. The findings show that there is a positive correlation between the dwell time and user explicit ratings. Although there was no significant correlation between mouse movement/distance and user explicit rating, there was a relationship between the homogeneous clusters of the implicit indicators and the user ratings.

AB  - This paper investigates how to exploit human feedback for interactive object segmentation in videos. In particular, we present an interactive video object segmentation approach where humans can contribute by either explicitly clicking on objects of interest in videos or implicitly while looking at video sequences. User feedback is then translated into a set of spatio-temporal constraints for an energy-based minimization problem. We tested the method on standard benchmarking datasets when using both eye-gaze data and user clicks. The results indicated how our method outperformed existing automated and interactive methods regardless of the type of human feedback (explicit or implicit), and that click-based feedback was more reliable than eye-gaze one.

TI  - Improving Head Movement Tolerance of Cross-Ratio Based Eye Trackers
JO  - International Journal of Computer Vision
SP  - 459
EP  - 481
VL  - 101
IS  - 3
AB  - When first introduced, the cross-ratio (CR) based remote eye tracking method offered many attractive features for natural human gaze-based interaction, such as simple camera setup, no user calibration, and invariance to head motion. However, due to many simplification assumptions, current CR-based methods are still sensitive to head movements. In this paper, we revisit the CR-based method and introduce two new extensions to improve the robustness of the method to head motion. The first method dynamically compensates for scale changes in the corneal reflection pattern, and the second method estimates true coplanar eye features so that the cross-ratio can be applied. We present real-time implementations of both systems, and compare the performance of these new methods using simulations and user experiments. Our results show a significant improvement in robustness to head motion and, for the user experiments in particular, an average reduction of up to 40 % in gaze estimation error was observed.

AB  - Many deaf adults in the U.S. have difficulty reading written English text; computer animations of American Sign Language (ASL) can improve these individuals’ access to information, communication, and services. Current ASL animation technology cannot automatically generate expressions in which the signer associates locations in space with entities under discussion, nor can it generate many ASL signs whose movements are modified based on these locations. To determine how important such phenomena are to user-satisfaction and the comprehension of animations by deaf individuals, we conducted a study in which native ASL signers evaluated ASL animations with and without entity-representing spatial phenomena. We found that the inclusion of these expressions in the repertoire of ASL animation systems led to a significant improvement in user comprehension of the animations, thereby motivating future research on automatically generating such ASL spatial expressions.

TI  - Improving design-pattern identification: a new approach and an exploratory study
JO  - Software Quality Journal
SP  - 145
EP  - 174
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - The identification of occurrences of design patterns in programs can help maintainers to understand the program design and implementation. It can also help them to make informed changes. Current identification approaches are limited to complete occurrences, are time- and resource-consuming, and lead to many false positives. We propose to combine a structural and a numerical approach to improve the identification of complete and incomplete occurrences of design patterns. We develop a structural approach using explanation-based constraint programming and we enhance this approach using experimentally built numerical signatures. We show that the use of numerical signatures improves the identification of complete and incomplete occurrences in terms of performance and precision.

TI  - Improving the representation of roles in conceptual modeling: theory, method, and evidence
JO  - Requirements Engineering
SP  - 465
EP  - 491
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
AB  - Conceptual models represent the Organizational domain for which an information system is developed. These models are important tools in defining the requirements for the system. When describing an Organization or part of it, a key concept is the notion of roles played by actors in the domain. Actors in an Organization act in various roles, hence, showing that roles in a conceptual model can promote understanding of how the Organization works. However, despite the importance of roles in understanding Organizations and their prevalence in various aspects of information systems development, no consensus exists on what roles are, or how to represent them in conceptual models. In this paper, we formally define role as a conceptual modeling construct based on literature analysis, ontological concepts, and principles of classification. Using this definition, we derive guidelines for representing roles in conceptual models and suggest rules for modeling roles with the widely used extended entity-relationship grammar. Finally, we test the effectiveness of the modeling rules by conducting an experimental study to compare the domain understanding of readers using two types of conceptual modeling scripts. One script was obtained by violating the rules and the other by not violating the rules. We obtained data on domain understanding (using problem-solving questions) and on the process of understanding (using eye tracking). The results indicate that the role-based rules are not only useful for understanding the models but also provide direct clues as to why this is so.

SP  - 363
EP  - 378
PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - Bookmarks are a valuable webpage re-visitation technique, but it is often difficult to find desired items in extensive bookmark collections. This experiment used response-time measures and eye-movement tracking to investigate how different information structures within bookmarks influence their salience and recognizability. Participants were presented with a series of news websites. The task following presentation of each site was to find the bookmark indexing the previously-seen page as quickly as possible. The Informational Structure of bookmarks was manipulated (top-down vs. bottom-up verbal organizations), together with the Number of Informational Cues present (one, two or three). Only this latter factor affected gross search times: Two cues were optimal, one cue was highly sub-optimal. However, more detailed eye-movement analyses of fixation behaviour on target items revealed interactive effects of both experimental factors, suggesting that the efficacy of bookmark recognition is crucially dependent on having an optimal combination of information quantity and information organization.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - We address the task of jointly determining what a person is doing and where they are looking based on the analysis of video captured by a headworn camera. We propose a novel deep model for joint gaze estimation and action recognition in First Person Vision. Our method describes the participant’s gaze as a probabilistic variable and models its distribution using stochastic units in a deep network. We sample from these stochastic units to generate an attention map. This attention map guides the aggregation of visual features in action recognition, thereby providing coupling between gaze and action. We evaluate our method on the standard EGTEA dataset and demonstrate performance that exceeds the state-of-the-art by a significant margin of $$3.5\%$$3.5%.

TI  - Incorporating Audio Signals into Constructing a Visual Saliency Map
BT  - Image and Video Technology
SP  - 468
EP  - 480
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The saliency map has been proposed to identify regions that draw human visual attention. Differences of features from the surroundings are hierarchially computed for an image or an image sequence in multiple resolutions and they are fused in a fully bottom-up manner to obtain a saliency map. A video usually contains sounds, and not only visual stimuli but also auditory stimuli attract human attention. Nevertheless, most conventional methods discard auditory information and image information alone is used in computing a saliency map. This paper presents a method for constructing a visual saliency map by integrating image features with auditory features. We assume a single moving sound source in a video and introduce a sound source feature. Our method detects the sound source feature using the correlation between audio signals and sound source motion, and computes its importance in each frame in a video using an auditory saliency map. The importance is used to fuse the sound source feature with image features to construct a visual saliency map. Experiments using subjects demonstrate that a saliency map by our proposed method reflects human’s visual attention more accurately than that by a conventional method.

AB  - The rapidly increasing availability of electronic publications containing information graphics poses some interesting challenges in terms of information access. For example, visually impaired individuals should ideally be provided with access to the knowledge that would be gleaned from viewing the information graphic. Similarly, digital libraries must take into account the content of information graphics when constructing indices. This paper outlines our approach to recognizing the intended message of an information graphic, focusing on the concept of perceptual task effort, its role in the inference process, our rules for estimating effort, and the results of an eye tracking experiment conducted in order to evaluate and modify those rules.

AB  - This study investigated the driver’s pupil diameter involved in car accidents within a driving simulation environment. The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between the vehicle accidents and the changes in pupil diameter. We hypothesized that the patterns of pupil diameter could indicate the occurrence of a collision and the severity of car accidents. To investigate the relationship between the drivers’ pupil diameter and the levels of a car accident, multiple hazard events were tested in a driving simulation environment. The eye-tracking technology was used to analyze the changes of pupil diameter and the vehicle accident events. We compared the patterns of pupil diameter trace among various levels of car accidents. The result showed that there was a significant difference on the patterns between minor crashes and severe crashes.

IS  - 3
AB  - Identifying indices of effort in post-editing of machine translation can have a number of applications, including estimating machine translation quality and calculating post-editors’ pay rates. Both source-text and machine-output features as well as subjects’ traits are investigated here in view of their impact on cognitive effort, which is measured with eye tracking and a subjective scale borrowed from the field of Educational Psychology. Data is analysed with mixed-effects models, and results indicate that the semantics-based automatic evaluation metric Meteor is significantly correlated with all measures of cognitive effort considered. Smaller effects are also observed for source-text linguistic features. Further insight is provided into the role of the source text in post-editing, with results suggesting that consulting the source text is only associated with how cognitively demanding the task is perceived in the case of those with a low level of proficiency in the source language. Subjects’ working memory capacity was also taken into account and a relationship with post-editing productivity could be noticed. Scaled-up studies into the construct of working memory capacity and the use of eye tracking in models for quality estimation are suggested as future work.

SP  - 22

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - A major thrust in building intelligent systems is to encourage users to capitalize their existing real world non-digital skills and seamlessly integrate the representations users have built in real world activities with their ongoing interactions with computing systems. In virtual environments, studies have demonstrated that users treat virtual environments as if they were real even when the environments were a crude approximation to real environments. These results revealed that the feeling of presence is a fluid dynamic psychological state that could vary depending on individual users’ characteristics. The current study aimed to investigate whether individual differences in working memory capacity impact the feelings of presence in virtual environments. Participants performed a vegetable cutting task on behalf of an avatar in a desktop virtual environment. Experiment 1 revealed that high working memory (HWM) individuals cut closer to the fingertip of the avatar than low working memory (LWM) individuals. Experiment 2 used eye-tracking measures and revealed that HWM participants mitigated the demonstrated risk by planning. Taken together, Experiments 1 and 2 provide evidence how individual differences in working memory capacity can impact the feelings of presence in virtual environments and demonstrated that our conscious experiences of what is real is malleable.

The examination of human interaction and behavior within their environments, particularly ones in which humans often perform functions critical to safety, is one topic studied by human factors and industrial engineers. Traditional measurement methods of human performance often include measures of reaction time and accuracy, e.g., how fast a person completes a task and how well this task is performed. These are generally measures associated with performance. To study the steps taken to perform the tasks requires analysis of the individual procedures performed. For this analysis, process measures are often needed. Eye movements are particularly interesting in this latter context since they present measures which can provide insights into the visual, cognitive, and attentional aspects of human performance.

We also show promising results on the classifier ability to detect learning in real-time during interaction.

AB  - Many studies have been done to investigate good abandonment, but only a few have utilized it to improve search engine performance. In this paper, we aim at inferring user preference in good abandonment. Particularly, we use eye movement data to infer which search result has satisfied user’s information need in each good abandonment instance. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted to capture user’s eye movement data in good abandonment search tasks. These data were transformed into histograms and sequences on which we applied popular machine learning algorithms for the inference. Our results show that the approach can infer user preference with reasonable accuracy.

This condition underlies a proof rule for proving that a nondeterministic program has no infinite computations satisfying a given formula, interpreted over state sequences. We also show two different forms of seemingly more natural necessary and sufficient conditions to be inadequate.

JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
SP  - 161
EP  - 173
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper reports on an experimental study on human–machine interface in LED manufacturing systems to measure the influence of information overload on user experience. The results are based on cognitive ergonomics. The experiment used eye-tracking methods and a questionnaire to gather data. The independent variables were interface complexity and user background. Interface complexity had three levels: high interface complexity, moderate interface complexity and low interface complexity. User background had two levels: the novice group and the expert group. The dependent variables included time to first fixation, fixations before and subjective feelings. A total of 38 operators participated in the experiment, and the results showed that (1) interface complexity caused a significant difference in time to first fixation (P < 0.05) and fixations before (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the results revealed significant differences between high complexity interfaces compared to low complexity interfaces (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between moderate and low complexity interfaces or between moderate and high complexity interfaces (P > 0.05); (2) user background significantly affected the user experience; (3) within the same complexity level, expert operators’ cognitive workload was significantly lower than that of novice operators; and (4) there was no significant relationship between the interface complexity and the user’s background. The study concludes that because interface complexity has a significant effect on the time taken to locate the target button on the screen, interface design should be as simple as possible, while still providing the necessary level of functionality.

AB  - Eye tracking heatmaps have become very popular and easy to create over the last few years. They are very compelling and can be effective in summarizing and communicating data. However, heatmaps are often used incorrectly and for the wrong reasons. In addition, many do not include all the information that is necessary for proper interpretation. This paper describes several types of heatmaps as representations of different aspects of visual attention, and provides guidance on when to use and how to interpret heatmaps. It explains how heatmaps are created and how their appearance can be modified by manipulating different display settings. Guidelines for proper use of heatmaps are also proposed.

TI  - Integrating Blink Click interaction into a head tracking system: implementation and usability issues
JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 247
EP  - 264
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
AB  - In the area of human–computer interaction, contemporary head tracking systems are often used as camera-based mouse emulators. While head movement detection provides the basis for related mouse shifting and positioning, standard click actions are usually emulated using stillness counter techniques such as Dwell Click (DC). However, these techniques can be a source of enlarged interaction burden, as users often have to struggle with time-consuming repetitive UI actions. This paper proposes a novel version of Blink Click (BC) action called B2C, based on double eye blink detection, as a valuable supplement for faster mouse click emulation. The integration of the proposed BC action into an existing head tracking system is presented, and implementation issues are thoroughly analyzed. Usability testing of the proposed B2C interaction model, along with the already embedded DC model, has been carried out, providing both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. The results show efficiency improvement as well as a higher level of users’ satisfaction when using the proposed version of BC, thus making it a strong candidate to become a standard feature within the computer-vision-based mouse emulation.

AB  - Extended learning environments involving system to collect data for learning analytics and to support learners will be useful for all-age education. As the first steps towards to build new learning environments, we developed a system for multimodal learning analytics using eye-tracker and EEG measurement, and inclusive user interface design for elderly learners by dual-tablet system. Multimodal learning analytics system can be supportive to extract where and how learners with varied backgrounds feel difficulty in learning process. The eye-tracker can retrieve information where the learners paid attention. EEG signals will provide clues to estimate their mental states during gazes in learning. We developed simultaneous measurement system of these multimodal responses and are trying to integrate the information to explore learning problems. A dual-tablet user interface with simplified visual layers and more intuitive operations was designed aiming to reduce the physical and mental loads of elderly learners. A prototype was developed based on a cross-platform framework, which is being refined by iterative formative evaluations participated by elderlies, in order to improve the usability of the interface design. We propose a system architecture applying the multimodal learning analytics and the user-friendly design for elderly learners, which couples learning analytics “in the wild” environment and learning analytics in controlled lab environments.

AB  - The Center for Innovation of Translation and Translation Technology (CRITT) environment at Copenhagen Business School (CBS) draws on primarily two types of NLP resources, namely treebanks and the logging of user activity data (UAD) during text production and translation activities, in order to do research into the cognitive processes that lie behind translation activity. In this paper we make a short presentation of the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank (CDT), and elaborate how UAD is obtained and represented in Translog-II. Finally, the paper discusses some general perspectives on how process-oriented translation research methodology could benefit from the integration of UAD with structural linguistic information in the form of linguistically annotated text data.

JO  - Machine Vision and Applications
SP  - 69
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Immersive virtual environments with life-like interaction capabilities can provide a high fidelity view of the virtual world and seamless interaction methods to the user. High demanding requirements, however, raise many challenges in the development of sensing technologies and display systems. The focus of this study is on improving the performance of human–computer interaction by rendering optimizations guided by head pose estimates and their uncertainties. This work is part of a larger study currently being under investigation at NASA Ames, called “Virtual GloveboX” (VGX). VGX is a virtual simulator that aims to provide advanced training and simulation capabilities for astronauts to perform precise biological experiments in a glovebox aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Our objective is to enhance the virtual experience by incorporating information about the user’s viewing direction into the rendering process. In our system, viewing direction is approximated by estimating head orientation using markers placed on a pair of polarized eye-glasses. Using eye-glasses does not pose any constraints in our operational environment since they are an integral part of a stereo display used in VGX. During rendering, perceptual level of detail methods are coupled with head-pose estimation to improve the visual experience. A key contribution of our work is incorporating head pose estimation uncertainties into the level of detail computations to account for head pose estimation errors. Subject tests designed to quantify user satisfaction under different modes of operation indicate that incorporating uncertainty information during rendering improves the visual experience of the user.

AB  - Severe motion impairments can result from non-progressive disorders, such as cerebral palsy, or degenerative neurological diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), or muscular dystrophy (MD). They can be due to traumatic brain injuries, for example, due to a traffic accident, or to brainstem strokes [9, 84]. Worldwide, these disorders affect millions of individuals of all races and ethnic backgrounds [4, 75, 52]. Because disease onset of MS and ALS typically occurs in adulthood, afflicted people are usually computer literate. Intelligent interfaces can immensely improve their daily lives by allowing them to communicate and participate in the information society, for example, by browsing the web, posting messages, or emailing friends. However, people with advanced ALS, MS, or MD may reach a point when they cannot control the keyboard and mouse anymore and also cannot rely on automated voice recognition because their speech has become slurred.

AB  - Research in human/computer interaction has primarily focused on natural language, text, speech and vision in isolation. A number of recent research projects have studied the integration of such modalities. The rationale is that many inherent ambiguities in single modes of communication can be resolved if extra information is available. This paper discusses issues related to designing and building a multi-modal system. The main characteristics of such a system are that it can process input and output from conventional as well as new channels. Examples of multi-modal systems are the Smart Work Manager [1] and the Intelligent Assistant [2]. Main components of the two systems described here are the reasoner, the speech system, the non-intrusive neural-network-based gaze-tracking system, the user presence detector and the integration platforms. The paper concludes with a discussion on the limitations and possible enhancements of the current system.

JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 6683
EP  - 6696
VL  - 75
IS  - 11
AB  - This work develops effective masks for AdaBoost-based gender classification. A set of intensity contrast masks around small regions of two neighbor pixels is proposed. The design exploits the sharp intensity contrast that is common to the male face and the smooth intensity contrast that is typically exhibited by the female face. The number of weak classifiers is only approximately 0.5 % of the set of weak classifiers based on pixel comparisons that were proposed by S. Baluja and H. Rowley (Int J Comput Vis 71(1):111–119, 2007). Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and confirm the basic ideas on which this study is based. The first is that intensity contrast in face images is essential to gender classification, and the number of intensity contrast features are more required than are those intensity contrast features designed based on pixel comparisons. Second, structural information in face images may not enable features to be distinguished. Third, although intensity contrast is important to gender classification, other factors should be considered in designing a complete set of gender-related features.

AB  - This paper investigates novel ways to direct computers by eye gaze. Instead of using fixations and dwell times, this work focuses on eye motion, in particular gaze gestures. Gaze gestures are insensitive to accuracy problems and immune against calibration shift. A user study indicates that users are able to perform complex gaze gestures intentionally and investigates which gestures occur unintentionally during normal interaction with the computer. Further experiments show how gaze gestures can be integrated into working with standard desktop applications and controlling media devices.

AB  - In-car devices with speech user interfaces are proliferating. How can we build these interfaces such that they allow human–computer interactions with multiple devices to overlap in time, but without interfering with the driving task? We suggest that interface design can be inspired by the way people deal with this problem in human–human dialogues and propose discovering human dialogue behaviors of interest through experiments. In this paper, we discuss how to design an appropriate human–human dialogue scenario for such experiments. We also report on one human–human experiment, in terms of the dialogue behaviors found, and impact on the verbal tasks and on driving. We also offer design considerations based on the results of the study.

AB  - Dyslexia Explorer is a screening program for dyslexia that focuses on mapping visual patterns of reading Arabic scripts to reading difficulties. Dyslexia Explorer is designed to process the eye gaze patterns exhibited by readers with Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLDs) in screening sessions with Arabic stimuli. The screening is based on gaze measures of eye fixation duration for the Area Of Interest (AOI), mean fixation duration, fixation count for the AOI, total fixations count, backward patterns (within words, lines and paragraph). The system is a novel contribution in screening for reading difficulties in the Arabic language. It helps in diagnosing dyslexia by specifying reading deficits, providing objective gaze metrics and linking them to phonological processing difficulties of readers.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Online video advertising (video-in-video) strategies are typically agnostic to the video content (ex.: advertising on YouTube) and the human viewer’s preferences. How to assess the emotional state and engagement of the viewer to place an advertisement? Where to insert an advertisement based on the content in an advertisement and a specific target video stream? Surely these are relevant questions that should be addressed by a good model for video advertisement placement. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address two important aspects of (a) multi-modal affective analysis of video content and viewer behavior (b) a method for interactive personalized advertisement insertion for a single user. Our analysis and framework is backed by a systematic study of literature in marketing, consumer psychology and affective analysis of videos. Results from the user-study experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art in video-in-video advertising.

AB  - Based on the analysis of “real” Second Life meetings data, in educational and professional settings, our objective is to understand the actual uses of this kind of Virtual World and more particularly, the interactive frames constructed in SL meetings and their interrelation with uses of communication media. The originality of our analytical framework stems from the combination of two perspectives: a third view perspective based on analyses of observational data and a first view perspective based on users’ reports on their experience in SL. Our results highlight: boundaries between serious and recreational registers; avatar’s expression and attribution of feelings to the person “behind”; spatial positioning as indicators and constructors of roles and engagement; management of communication fluidity and joint focus; narrowing of communication media used for task focus content; emerging mediation role for management of fractured exchanges.

AB  - The project Stylized Animations for Research on Autism (SARA) aims to develop a better understanding of the cognitive processes behind emotional categorization in children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in comparison with neurotypically developed peers. To this end, we combine novel real-time non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) algorithms, emotional facial animations, and eye-tracking technologies in a framework that serves as an interactive testbed for empirical research. In this paper, we focus on three experiments that: (1) validate real-time facial animations of virtual characters, (2) evaluate the NPR algorithms to create abstracted facial expressions, and (3) elucidate the relation between eye gaze behavior, ASD and alexithymia (i.e., difficulties in expressing ones emotions). The results show that our animations can be used in the proposed experiments; however, more evaluation is needed regarding the NPR abstractions, especially with individuals with ASD. Finally, even though no correlation was found between gaze behavior, ASD and alexithymia, the study opened several questions that will be addressed in future work.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of the cockpit interface design on pilots’ attention distribution during flight operations. Two different fighter jet simulators, Fighter-A and Fighter-B, with different interface designs were used in this research. Both Fighter-A and Fighter-B simulators are dynamic, high-fidelity trainers that replicate actual aircraft performance, navigation and weapon systems. Sixty-nine qualified mission-ready pilots (39 Fighter-A pilots, 30 Fighter-B pilots) participated in this research. Fighter-A pilots had: ages between 26 and 45 years old (M = 34, SD = 5); total flying hours between 372 and 3,200 h (M = 1294, SD = 753); and type flying hours between 89 and 2,270 h (M = 815, SD = 524). Fighter-B pilots had: ages between 26 and 51 years old (M = 30, SD = 6); total flying hours between 310 and 2,920 h (M = 845, SD = 720); and type flying hours between 63 and 2,000 h (M = 461, SD = 487). Eye movement data were collected by a head-mounted ASL (Applied Science Laboratory) Mobile Eye, which is 76 g in weight. Eye movements at five areas of interest (AOIs) were analyzed, since those AOIs provide pilots with the required flight information to accomplish the mission. The AOIs are: Head-up Display (HUD); Integrated Control Panel (ICP); Right Multiple Function Display (RMFD); Left Multiple Function Display (LMFD); and Outside of Cockpit (OC). The findings indicate that differences in interface design might impact pilots’ visual scanning patterns, which is associated closely with attention distribution. This research demonstrated that interface designs of HUD, ICP, RMFD and LMFD of Fighter-A attract a higher percentage of fixation and longer average fixation duration compared with Fighter-B. Furthermore, Fighter-A pilots’ perceived workloads were lower, but their situational awareness performance was better than Fighter-B pilots. The application of an eye-tracking device during flight operations is not only beneficial to understand the pilot’s attention distribution, but also to understand the interaction performance between the pilot and the interface. The findings of this research have potential benefits for improving interface design and the efficiency of aviation training.

We look at studies involving these fonts to see evidence for or against them. The studies try to be scientific, but lack internal validity; i.e., the studies don’t eliminate the possibility that something else could explain the result.

AB  - Gamification is the concept that utilizing elements and ideas of video games in non-gaming fields. It aims at improving user experience, user engagement and users’ motivation by utilizing elements and mechanisms by which video games entertain many people. In the paper, we explain some basic ideas to let people enjoy housekeeping work, and propose a vacuum cleaner with gamification elements as an example of the ideas. As a result of the experiments, it turned out that our vacuum cleaner with game elements could provide more enjoyable experience to users than usual.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - New Directions in Empirical Translation Process Research is a continuation of the development which originates in descriptive translation studies as conceived by Holmes (1972) and Toury (1995). This introduction shows how this volume is a documentation of a technological development which makes it possible for translation research to go beyond the description. As the various chapters in this volume argue, the analysis of records from keyloggers and eye-trackers enable us to “explain and predict” (Holmes, 1972:71) translators’ behaviour on various levels of granularity. All contributions are centered around the CRITT TPR-DB, a unique resource of more than 500 h of recorded translation process data augmented with over 200 different annotations. The chapters describe aspects of computational, statistical and psycholinguistic models of the translation process that are facilitated by the TPR-DB. This chapter gives an overview of the contributions and provides a background for the work reported in the volume.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with interactions between computers and human through the medium of languages. NLP is founded on the science of linguistics, whose aim it is to gain insight into the linguistic operations integral to human livelihood and existence, in the form of speech, writing, and multimodal content. The goal of NLP (often otherwise referred to as Computational Linguistics) is to translate linguistic principles and artifacts to and from computer-understandable forms. Why is this important? Well, in the current era of online information explosion, it has become necessary for agencies and individuals to extract and organize critical information from a humongous amount of electronic textual content from Web sites, conversation systems, and other modes of communication. Since manual extraction of such information can be prohibitively expensive, it has become obvious to automatize the process of information gathering from large-scale text. And, NLP provides ways to do that.

AB  - This chapter first discusses various areas of eye gaze research in order to show that gaze information plays an important role in various human cognitive activities. Based on the discussion, a three-step approach towards effective and natural gaze-aware human-computer interaction is proposed, which involves the analysis of human attentional behaviors, establishing computational models for interpreting eye gaze information, and building gaze-aware user interfaces. Finally, an overview of each chapter is provided to discuss how each of them contributes to one of these aspects.

BT  - Hierarchical Perceptual Grouping for Object Recognition: Theoretical Views and Gestalt-Law Applications

AB  - Images contain repetitions of structure. Very often, these similar things are ordered along certain laws, which are long known and referred to as Gestalt laws. Things are arranged in patterns. Moreover, often there is hierarchy in such arrangements. Small things are arranged in patterns within bigger things, and these in turn may again be part of an even greater aggregate, and so forth. This chapter introduces the analysis of such hierarchies informally by discussing a small probe of example images. Thus motivated a domain is introduced in which these things can be manipulated by machines. We call them Gestalten. They feature location, scale, orientation, and so forth. But their most important property is their assessment—a number between zero and one. This chapter also reviews related approaches to the topic. There are several important books that give alternative views, and continuous competition workshops on symmetry recognition are held along the major machine vision conferences, and of course, there are key publications in major journals.

AB  - Enterprise information, such as policies and procedures, enterprise data, enterprise social networks, and emails, to name a few, all reside in different information systems. This situation results in information silos, which in turn lead to the increased cost of information integration and reduced capacity for exploiting synergies within the organization. In fact, information silos in organizational information systems can result in inefficiency of information retrieval, redundancy and conflicts between information assets of the company, leading to duplication of efforts and job roles, as well as an incomplete understanding of the organization.

AB  - Mental workload is an increasingly important determinant of the performance of human-machine systems. As the power, complexity and ubiquity of both everyday and specialised computing solutions increase, the limiting factor of such systems performance is shifting from the ma-chine to the human. This dynamic is further exacerbated by the need for human decision making in environments characterized by the need to process and integrate an unprecedented amount of information. Furthermore, the rapid pace of industrial, commercial, and indeed every-day life frequently requires high levels of user performance under time-limited conditions and often in sub-optimal contexts characterised by stress and competing demands for attention. As such, the need to understand and design for the particular characteristics of the user has never been stronger.

AB  - Pointing with the hand is an activity so basic and pervasive to human experience that most of us fail to notice the complex neural and psychomotor functioning that makes it possible. But pointing is more than neuromuscular events: it is the expression of our focus of attention on a particular aspect of the world. Pointing is inherently the communication of our intentions to other people. It is a demonstrative activity. It is with this sense that the, somewhat peculiarly named, computer input devices — the mouse, the joystick and the trackball — have become known as pointing devices. In a highly interactive system with a graphical user interface (GUI), the act of pointing is an act of communication with the system. Computer-based pointing is an expression of human intention that selects objects and actions mutually ‘known’ to the human user and the program.

TI  - Inverse discounted-based LQR algorithm for learning human movement behaviors
JO  - Applied Intelligence
SP  - 1489
EP  - 1501
VL  - 49
IS  - 4
AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing interest towards understanding human movement behaviors. In this regard, one of the approaches is to retrieve the unknown underlying objective function that the human has to optimize while achieving a certain movement behavior. Existing research of behavioral understanding merely depends on predefined optimality criteria, where the minimum time, minimum variance or/and minimum effort are mainly adopted. These criteria are assumed to be constant, where the human is assumed to have the same preferences during the movement duration. However, in this paper, the optimality criteria underlying the kinematic characteristics of a certain human behavior are assumed to be exponentially discounted to account for the change in the human preferences that could happen while achieving this behavior. A new Inverse Discounted-based Linear Quadratic Regulator (ID-LQR) algorithm is developed in the light of Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) framework to find out the discounted cost function that could reproduce the measured human behavior perfectly. Meanwhile, an Incremental version of the ID-LQR algorithm is proposed to continuously refine the so far learned cost function in the case of sequentially presented demonstrations. The saccadic eye gaze movement is studied as an example to quantify both the proposed ID-LQR and Inverse ID-LQR approaches. Simulation results are encouraging and show that the saccadic trajectories generated by ID-LQR approach match the experimental data in many aspects, including position and velocity profiles of saccades. Moreover, when it is assessed by a subsequent set of scenarios, the incremental ID-LQR algorithm confirms its capability to generalize the so far retrieved cost function for the unseen saccadic demonstrations.

BT  - Immersive Learning Research Network
SP  - 222
EP  - 233
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Prior research has supported that game-based learning is dependent on the degree of immersion achieved, namely the degree to which children become cognitively and emotionally engaged with a given educational digital game. With the emergence of embodied digital educational games, researchers have assumed that the affordances of these games for movement-based interaction may heighten even more experienced immersion. However, there is lack of empirical research on the investigation of children’s immersive experiences in embodied educational games, warranting this claim. Existing research on immersion is still restricted in highly-controlled laboratory settings and focuses on non-educational embodied games played by mostly young adult populations. Extending prior research in the educational context, this study has investigated children’s immersion in a high-embodied digital learning game integrated in an authentic school classroom (Group1 = 24), in comparison to a low-embodied digital version of the game (Group2 = 20). Our findings did not support previous hypotheses regarding experienced immersion in high-embodied digital games; post-interventional surveys indicated that there was no difference in most dimensions of experienced immersion. Interviews with a subset of the children (n = 8 per condition) resulted in the identification of various (a) media form, (b) media content and (c) context-related factors, which provided plausible explanations about children’s experienced immersion in the two conditions. Implications are discussed for supporting immersion in high-embodied educational digital games implemented in authentic educational settings.

EP  - 218
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Natural language text and source code are very different in their structure and semantics. Source code uses words from natural language such as English mainly in comments and identifier names. Is there an inherent difference in the way programmers read natural language text compared to source code? Does expertise play a role in the reading behavior of programmers? In order to start answering these questions, we conduct a controlled experiment with novice and non-novice programmers while they read small short snippets of natural language text and C++ source code. This study is a replication of an earlier study by Busjahn et al. [1] but uses C++ instead of Java source code. The study was conducted with 33 students, who were each given ten tasks: a set of seven programs, and three natural language texts. They were asked one of three random comprehension questions after each task. Using several linearity metrics presented in an earlier study [1], we analyze the eye movements on source code and natural language. The results indicate that novices and non-novices both read source code less linearly than natural language text. We did not find any differences between novices and non-novices between natural language text and source code. We compare our results to the Busjahn study and provide directions for future work.

EP  - 152
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This chapter introduces translator-information interaction (TII) as the field of study that investigates translators’ interaction with (digital) information and information tools. In particular, the current chapter examines translators’ interaction with a prototype biconcordancer (BiConc) tool integrated in the CASMACAT workbench. The BiConc was introduced in the third CASMACAT field trial (The data of the third CASMACAT field trial is stored in the TPR-DB under the study name CFT14, cf. Chap. 2, this volume.) a post-editing experiment involving seven English-to-Spanish professional translators. In addition to external online tools, the BiConc was one of the informational resources that participants could use while post-editing two machine-translated texts under two different conditions: (1) traditional post-editing and (2) interactive post-editing with online learning (A description of the CASMACAT online-learning mode is provided in Chap. 3in this volume). In the case study reported in this chapter, only the segments in which participants used the CASMACAT BiConc tool were examined. On the basis of screen recordings, the present study analyses the way translators interacted with the BiConc and other informational resources in order to solve a particular problem while post-editing. Overall, the chapter argues that human-centered research is essential not only in the understanding of the cognitive processes involved in translation activity, but also in the development and the improvement of tools intended to better address the professional needs of translators. Thus, this case study and subsequent TII investigations can be used to inform the efficient integration of the BiConc tool and other informational resources to CASMACAT and other future-generation (web-based) translation environments.

JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 119
EP  - 136
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - Currently, lane change decision aid systems primarily address foveal vision and thus compete for drivers’ attention with interfaces of other assistant systems. Also, alternative modalities such as acoustic perception (Mahapatra et al., in: 2008 International conference on advanced computer theory and engineering, pp 992–995. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2008.165, 2008), tactile perception (Löcken et al., in: Adjunct proceedings of the 7th international conference on automotive user interfaces and interactive vehicular applications, AutomotiveUI ’15, pp 32–37. ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/2809730.2809758, 2015), or peripheral vision (Löcken et al., in: Proceedings of the 7th international conference on automotive user interfaces and interactive vehicular applications, AutomotiveUI ’15, pp 204–211. ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/2799250.2799259, 2015), have been introduced for lane change support. We are especially interested in ambient light displays (ALD) addressing peripheral vision since they can adapt to the driver’s attention using changing saliency levels (Matthews et al., in: Proceedings of the 17th Annual ACM symposium on user interface software and technology, UIST ’04, pp 247–256, ACM. https://doi.org/10.1145/1029632.1029676, 2004). The primary objective of this research is to compare the effect of ambient light and focal icons on driving performance and gaze behavior. We conducted two driving simulator experiments. The first experiment evaluated an ambient light cue in a free driving scenario. The second one focused on the difference in gaze behavior between ALD and focal icons, called “abstract faces with emotional expressions” (FEE). The results show that drivers decide more often for safe gaps in rightward maneuvers with ambient light cues. Similarly, drivers decide to overtake more often when the gaps are big enough with both displays in the second experiment. Regarding gaze behavior, drivers looked longer towards the forward area, and less often and shorter into the side mirrors when using ALD. This effect supports the assumption that drivers perceive the ALD with peripheral vision. In contrast, FEE did not significantly affect the gaze behavior when compared to driving without assistance. These results help us to understand the effect of different modalities on performance and gaze behavior, and to explore appropriate modalities for lane change support.

SP  - 231

VL  - 19
IS  - 2
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a user study on exploratory search activities in a social science digital library. We conducted a user study with 32 participants with a social sciences background—16 postdoctoral researchers and 16 students—who were asked to solve a task on searching related work to a given topic. The exploratory search task was performed in a 10-min time slot. The use of certain search activities is measured and compared to gaze data recorded with an eye tracking device. We use a novel tree graph representation to visualise the users’ search patterns and introduce a way to combine multiple search session trees. The tree graph representation is capable of creating one single tree for multiple users and identifying common search patterns. In addition, the information behaviour of students and postdoctoral researchers is being compared. The results show that search activities on the stratagem level are frequently utilised by both user groups. The most heavily used search activities were keyword search, followed by browsing through references and citations, and author searching. The eye tracking results showed an intense examination of documents metadata, especially on the level of citations and references. When comparing the group of students and postdoctoral researchers, we found significant differences regarding gaze data on the area of the journal name of the seed document. In general, we found a tendency of the postdoctoral researchers to examine the metadata records more intensively with regard to dwell time and the number of fixations. By creating combined session trees and deriving subtrees from those, we were able to identify common patterns like economic (explorative) and exhaustive (navigational) behaviour. Our results show that participants utilised multiple search strategies starting from the seed document, which means that they examined different paths to find related publications.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper investigates the use of a gaze-based interface for testing simple shared attention behaviours during an interaction scenario with a virtual agent. The interface is non-intrusive, operating in real-time using a standard web-camera for input, monitoring users’ head directions and processing them in real-time for resolution to screen coordinates. We use the interface to investigate user perception of the agent’s behaviour during a shared attention scenario. Our aim is to elaborate important factors to be considered when constructing engagement models that must account not only for behaviour in isolation, but also for the context of the interaction, as is the case during shared attention situations.

AB  - We have investigated the accessibility issues of the program selection menus of a digital television interface. Initially we have simulated interaction patterns of visually and mobility impaired users and based on the simulation we have made changes to the font size and layout of the existing interface. Finally we have evaluated the new interface through a user trial involving people with disabilities. The results show that the new interface reduced the average time to select a channel and number of wrong channel selections for most of the participants.

AB  - Third party applications play an important role in enhancing a social network user’s online experience. These applications request various permissions from the users at install-time. However, these permissions are often ignored, and the users end up granting access to sensitive information. This motivates the need for techniques that can attract user attention towards the requested permissions and make users read and understand the permissions before authorizing them.

AB  - Air traffic controllers (ATC) have to perform under highly demanding circumstances, and they are often responsible for the lives of more than 5.000 people in mid-air at any given moment. Therefore, besides regular scheduled breaks to recover, it is of paramount importance to be in a level-minded state in order to maximize cognitive capabilities. Within this context and based on our previous research with active air traffic controllers, we designed a comparable scenario in which two airplanes from different directions converge and where subjects have to prevent collision. They watched an emotion inducing video shortly before participating in the experiment. The induced positive or negative valence lead to significant group-differences during their performance of the ATC task.

AB  - Research on quality issues of business process models has recently begun to explore the process of creating process models by analyzing the modeler’s interactions with the modeling environment. In this paper we aim to complement previous insights on the modeler’s modeling behavior with data gathered by tracking the modeler’s eye movements when engaged in the act of modeling. We present preliminary results and outline directions for future research to triangulate toward a more comprehensive understanding of the process of process modeling. We believe that combining different views on the process of process modeling constitutes another building block in understanding this process that will ultimately enable us to support modelers in creating better process models.

AB  - We investigate the utility of an eye tracker for providing information on users’ affect and reasoning. To do so, we conducted a user study, results from which show that users’ pupillary responses differ significantly between positive and negative affective states. As far as reasoning is concerned, while our analysis shows that larger pupil size is associated with more constructive reasoning events, it also suggests that to disambiguate between different kinds of reasoning, additional information may be needed. Our results show that pupillary response is a promising non-invasive avenue for increasing user model bandwidth.

JO  - Software Quality Journal
SP  - 641
EP  - 670
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
AB  - Past and recent studies have shown that design smells which are poor solutions to recurrent design problems make object-oriented systems difficult to maintain, and that they negatively impact the class change- and fault-proneness. More recently, lexical smells have been introduced to capture recurring poor practices in the naming, documentation, and choice of identifiers during the implementation of an entity. Although recent studies show that developers perceive lexical smells as impairing program understanding, no study has actually evaluated the relationship between lexical smells and software quality as well as their interaction with design smells. In this paper, we detect 29 smells consisting of 13 design smells and 16 lexical smells in 30 releases of three projects: ANT, ArgoUML, and Hibernate. We analyze to what extent classes containing lexical smells have higher (or lower) odds to change or to be subject to fault fixing than other classes containing design smells. Our results show and bring empirical evidence on the fact that lexical smells can make, in some cases, classes with design smells more fault-prone. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that classes containing design smells only are more change- and fault-prone than classes with lexical smells only.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Effective hand-eye coordination is an important aspect of training in laparoscopic surgery. This paper investigates the interdependency of the hand and eye movement along with the variability of their temporal relationships based on Granger-causality. Partial directed coherence is used to reveal the subtle effects of improvement in hand-eye coordination, where the causal relationship between instrument and eye movement gradually reverse during simple laparoscopic tasks. For assessing the practical value of the proposed technique for minimally invasive surgery, two laparoscopic experiments have been conducted to examine the ability of the trainees in handling mental rotation tasks, as well as dissection and manipulation skills in laparoscopic surgery. Detailed experimental results highlight the value of the technique in investigating hand-eye coordination in laparoscopic training, particularly during early motor learning for complex bimanual procedures.

SP  - 175
EP  - 187
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye movements can reflect the brain activities in word recognition and speech planning processes during reading and spontaneous speech comprehension. Most of the previous studies used isolated words alone to investigate the latency time of speech planning. However, it is difficult to explore the mechanism for speech planning in the real situation. In this paper, we used continuous speech to investigate the mechanism of speech planning by means of matching eye movements with the utterances during reading Chinese sentences. The plan units of the reading speech were estimated using the fixation of the eye movements, and the latent times for speech planning were measured for each unit in the reading sentences. It is found that the majority of the planning units was a grammatical word, while most of the four-syllable words were planned as two disyllable units. The latent time of the planning units decreases gradually along the time axis of a sentence. When a sentence consists of two sub-sentences, the decline tendency of the latent time was reset in the boundary between the two sub-sentences. When removing the meaning of the sentence by randomizing the word order, however, the declined tendency of the latent time was disappeared. These phenomena showed that the posterior words of the sentences may save time in semantic comprehension since the preceding words provided more semantic information for posterior ones. We can conclude that the semantic comprehension is an important part for speech planning as well as motor command designs, although comprehension is not an explicit task in the uttering.

SP  - 25
EP  - 32
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Depth estimation is one of the most fundamental challenges for performing minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. The requirement of accurate 3D instrument navigation using limited visual depth cues makes such tasks even more difficult. With the constant expectation of improving safety for MIS, there is a growing requirement for overcoming such constraints during MIS. We present in this paper a method of improving the surgeon’s perception of depth by introducing an “invisible shadow” in the operative field cast by an endoscopic instrument. Although, the shadow is invisible to human perception, it can be digitally detected, enhanced and re-displayed. Initial results from our study suggest that this method improves depth perception especially when the endoscopic instrument is in close proximity to the surface. Experiment results have shown that the method could potentially be used as an instrument navigation aid allowing accurate maneuvering of the instruments whilst minimizing tissue trauma.

BT  - Handbook of Iris Recognition

PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - The objective of this chapter is to present how to employ pupil dynamics in eye liveness detection. A thorough review of current liveness detection methods is provided at the beginning of the chapter to make the scientific background and position this method within current state-of-the-art methodology. Pupil dynamics may serve as a component of a wider presentation attack detection in iris recognition systems, making them more secure. Due to a lack of public databases that would support this research, we have built our own iris capture device to register pupil size changes under visible light stimuli, and registered 204 observations for 26 subjects (52 different irides), each containing 750 iris images taken every 40 ms. Each measurement registers the spontaneous pupil oscillations and its reaction after a sudden increase and a sudden decrease of the intensity of visible light. The Kohn and Clynes pupil dynamics modelKohn and Clynes pupil dynamics modelis used to describe these changes; hence, we convert each observation into a point in a feature space defined by model parameters. To answer the question whether the eye is alive (that is, if it reacts to light changes as a human eye) or the presentation is suspicious (that is, if it reacts oddly or no reaction is observed), we use linear and nonlinear support vector machines to classify natural reaction and spontaneous oscillations, simultaneously investigating the goodness of fit to reject bad modeling. Our experiments show that this approach can achieve a perfect performance for the data we have collected; all normal reactions are correctly differentiated from spontaneous oscillations. We investigated three variants of modeling to find the simplest, yet still powerful configuration of the method, namely (1) observing the pupil reaction to both the positive and negative changes in the light intensity, (2) using only the pupil reaction to positive surge of the light intensity, and (3) employing only the pupil reaction when the light is suddenly turned off. Further investigation related to the shortest observation time required to model the pupil reaction led to the final conclusion that time periods not exceeding 3 s are adequate to offer a perfect performance (on this dataset).

CY  - Cham
AB  - According to previous research, head mounted displays (HMDs) and head worn cameras (HWCs) are useful for remote collaboration. These systems can be especially helpful for remote assistance on physical tasks, when a remote expert can see the workspace of the local user and provide feedback. However, a HWC often has a wide field of view and so it may be difficult to know exactly where the local user is looking. In this chapter we explore how head mounted eye-tracking can be used to convey gaze cues to a remote collaborator. We describe two prototypes developed that integrate an eye-tracker with a HWC and see-through HMD, and results from user studies conducted with the systems. Overall, we found that showing gaze cues on a shared video appears to be better than just providing the video on its own, and combining gaze and pointing cues is the most effective interface for remote collaboration among the conditions tested. We also discuss the limitations of this work and present directions for future research.

AB  - Patient-centered healthcare and increased efficiency are major goals of modern medicine, and physician–patient interaction and communication are a cornerstone of clinical encounters. The introduction of the electronic health record (EHR) has been a key component in shaping not only organization, clinical workflow and ultimately physicians’ clinical decision making, but also patient–physician communication in the medical office. In order to inform the design of future EHR interfaces and assess their impact on patient-centered healthcare, designers and researchers must understand the multimodal nature of the complex physician–patient–EHR system interaction. However, characterizing multimodal activity is difficult and expensive, often requiring manual coding of hours of video data. We present our Lab-in-a-Box solution that enables the capture of multimodal activity in real-world settings. We focus here on the medical office where our Lab-in-a-Box system exploits a range of sensors to track computer-based activity, speech interaction, visual attention and body movements, and automatically synchronize and segment this data. The fusion of multiple sensors allows us to derive initial activity segmentation and to visualize it for further interactive analysis. By empowering researchers with cutting-edge data collection tools and accelerating analysis of multimodal activity in the medical office, our Lab-in-a-Box has the potential to uncover important insights and inform the next generation of Health IT systems.

AB  - This paper presents LECTOR, a system that helps educators in understanding when students have stopped paying attention to the educational process and assists them in reengaging the students to the current learning activity. LECTOR aims to take advantage of the ambient facilities that “smart classrooms” have to offer by (i) enabling educators to employ their preferred attention monitoring strategies (including any well-established activity recognition techniques) in order to identify inattentive behaviors and (ii) recommending interventions for motivating distracted students when deemed necessary. Furthermore, LECTOR offers an educator friendly design studio that enables teachers to create or modify the rules that trigger “inattention alarms”, as well as tailor the intervention mechanism to the needs of their course by modifying the respective rules. This paper presents the rationale behind the design of LECTOR and outlines its key features and facilities.

AB  - User fatigue problem in traditional interactive genetic algorithms restricts its population size. It is necessary to maintain a large population size to optimize complicated problems. We present a large population size interactive genetic algorithm with individuals’ fitness not assigned by user in this paper. The algorithm divides the population into several clusters, and the maximum number of clusters is changeable with the evolution and distribution of the population. The user only evaluates a center individual in each cluster and others’ fitness is estimated based on these ones. In addition, to assign a center individual’s fitness, we record the time when the user evaluates it satisfactory or unsatisfactory according to his/her sensitiveness, and its fitness is automatically calculated based on the time. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to the one-max problem, and compare it with traditional interactive genetic algorithms. The experimental results validate its efficiency.

BT  - Human Mental Workload: Models and Applications
SP  - 131
EP  - 146
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Mental workload has traditionally been measured by three different methods corresponding to its primary reflections: performance, subjective and physiological measures. Although we would expect a certain degree of convergence, research has shown that the emergence of disassociations and insensitivities between measures is very frequent. One possible explanation could be related to the differing latencies between each workload assessment method. We tested this explanation by manipulating task complexity through time spent performing a simulated air-traffic control task. In the experimental session, we collected physiological (pupil size), performance and subjective data. Our results showed two periods of bad performance caused by high traffic density and aircraft configurations. Those periods corresponded to higher mental workload as detected by subjective and physiological measures. However, subjective mental workload reacted sooner than physiological mental workload to task demands. These results suggest that the differences in latency could partially explain mental workload dissociations and insensitivities between measures.

We were also interested in uncovering any specific profiles of translators depending on personal factors such as previous experience in post-editing and typing skills. Finally, the aim was also to collect feedback from the post-editors in order to know more about their views regarding this type of technology.

AB  - Each learner has different preferences and needs. Therefore, it is very crucial to provide the different styles of learners with different learning environments that are more preferred and more efficient to them. This paper reports a study of the intelligent learning environment where the learner’s preferences are diagnosed, and then user interfaces are customized in an adaptive manner to accommodate the preferences. A learning system with a specific interface has been devised based on the learning-style model by Felder & Silverman, so that different learner preferences are revealed through user interactions with the system. Using this interface, learning styles are diagnosed from learner behavior patterns on the interface using Decision Tree and Hidden Markov Model approaches.

TI  - Learning gaze typing: what are the obstacles and what progress to expect?
JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
SP  - 297
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Gaze interaction is a promising input modality for people who are unable to control their fingers and arms. This paper suggests a number of new metrics that can be applied to the analysis of gaze typing interfaces and to the evaluation of user performance. These metrics are derived from a close examination of eight subjects typing text by gazing on a dwell-time activated onscreen keyboard during a seven-day experiment. One of the metrics, termed “Attended keys per character”, measures the number of keys that are attended for each typed character. This metric turned out to be particularly well correlated to the actual numbers of errors committed (r = 0.915). In addition to introducing metrics specific for gaze typing, the paper discusses how the metrics could make remote progress monitoring possible and provides some general advice on how to introduce gaze typing for novice users.

TI  - Learning multimodal behavioral models for face-to-face social interaction
JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 195
EP  - 210
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - The aim of this paper is to model multimodal perception-action loops of human behavior in face-to-face interactions. To this end, we propose trainable behavioral models that predict the optimal actions for one specific person given others’ perceived actions and the joint goals of the interlocutors. We first compare sequential models—in particular discrete hidden Markov models (DHMMs)—with standard classifiers (SVMs and decision trees). We propose a modification of the initialization of the DHMMs in order to better capture the recurrent structure of the sensory-motor states. We show that the explicit state duration modeling by discrete hidden semi markov models (DHSMMs) improves prediction performance. We applied these models to parallel speech and gaze data collected from interacting dyads. The challenge was to predict the gaze of one subject given the gaze of the interlocutor and the voice activity of both. For both DHMMs and DHSMMs the short-time Viterbi concept is used for incremental decoding and prediction. For the proposed models we evaluated objectively several properties in order to go beyond pure classification performance. Results show that incremental DHMMs (IDHMMs) were more efficient than classic classifiers and superseded by incremental DHSMMs (IDHSMMs). This later result emphasizes the relevance of state duration modeling.

AB  - Given its complexity, understanding the behavior of users on the Web has been one of the most challenging tasks for data mining-related fields. Historically, most of the approaches have considered web logs as the main source of data. This has led to several successful cases, both in industry and academia, but has also presented several issues and limitations. Given the new challenges and the need for personalization, improvement is required in the overall understanding of the processes that lie behind web browsing decision making. The use of neurodata to support this analysis represents a huge opportunity in terms of understanding the actions taken by the user on the web in a more comprehensive way. Techniques such as eye tracking, pupil dilation and EEG analysis could provide valuable information to craft more robust models. This chapter overviews the current state of the art of the use of neurodata for web-based analysis, providing a description and analysis in terms of the feasibility and effectiveness of each strategy given a specific problem.

AB  - Numerous techniques have been developed for text entry by gaze, and similarly, a number of evaluations have been carried out to determine the efficiency of the solutions. However, the results of the published experiments are inconclusive, and it is unclear what causes the difference in their findings. Here we look particularly at the effect of the language used in the experiment. A study where participants entered text both in English and in Finnish does not show an effect of language structure: the entry rates were reasonably close to each other. The role of other explaining factors, such as calibration accuracy and experimental procedure, are discussed.

AB  - Maintaining alertness is critical to the successful performance of a variety of tasks, ranging from target detection to language comprehension. Previous studies have identified neural correlates of fluctuations in alertness, namely the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and the default mode network (DMN). The current study examined the extent to which pupil dilation, an autonomic physiological response, tracks variation in the CON and DMN in a functional neuroimaging and pupillometry resting-state session. The results revealed that increasing pupil dilation was associated with increasing CON activity and decreasing DMN activity, and that regions of these networks were functionally anti-correlated. Furthermore, individuals with better self-reported attention control abilities (i.e., more mindful of the present moment) exhibited a reduction in the trade-off between these systems. These results suggest that pupillometry provides a valuable proxy of activity in the neural systems that underlie alertness, which may be impacted by individual differences in mindfulness.

CY  - Cham
AB  - What target is focused on by many people? Analysis of the target is a crucial task, especially in a cinema, a stadium, and so on. However, it is very difficult to estimate the gaze of each person in a crowd accurately and simultaneously with existing image-based eye tracking methods, since the image resolution of each person becomes low when we capture the whole crowd with a distant camera. Therefore, we introduce a new approach for localizing the gaze target focused on by a crowd of people. The proposed framework aggregates the individually estimated results of each person’s gaze. It enables us to localize the target being focused on by them even though each person’s gaze localization from a low-resolution image is inaccurate. We analyze the effects of an aggregation method on the localization accuracy using images capturing a crowd of people in a tennis stadium under the assumption that all of the people are focusing on the same target, and also investigate the effect of the number of people involved in the aggregation on the localization accuracy. As a result, the proposed method showed the ability to improve the localization accuracy as it is applied to a larger crowd of people.

AB  - Modern psychophysiological game research faces the problem that for understanding the computer game experience, it needs to analyze game events with high temporal resolution and within the game context. This is the only way to achieve greater understanding of gameplay and the player experience with the use of psychophysiological instrumentation. This paper presents a solution to recording in-game events with the frequency and accuracy of psychophysiological recording systems, by sending out event byte codes through a parallel port to the psychophysiological signal acquisition hardware. Thus, psychophysiological data can immediately be correlated with in-game data. By employing this system for psychophysiological game experiments, researchers will be able to analyze gameplay in greater detail in future studies.

AB  - Solutions for personalizing websites by automatically changing user interfaces (UI) to fit users’ needs have been proposed by the industry and the academy in order to provide individualized user experience. However, the users’ perception of changes in the tailored UI is still a topic to be studied. This work presents a tool developed to capture logs, generate, and apply individual adjustments, personalizing websites as people use it. In addition, the tool is proposed as a log-based personalization assistive technology and it is published to the community. The tool was evaluated in depth, qualitatively, counting with the participation of 4 blind users fluent in using the Web, knowing personalization existing features, and fluent on using computers. They were invited so that the understanding of outcomes and limitations of the personalization features offered could be better understood. Based on the results, we highlight possible scenarios where similar approaches could be used to assist people with disabilities and reinforce the importance of considering the users’ perception of changes automatically performed in UIs.

AB  - Mutual gaze is a powerful cue for communicating social attention and intention. A plethora of studies have demonstrated the fundamental roles of mutual gaze in establishing communicative links between humans, and enabling non-verbal communication of social attention and intention. The amount of mutual gaze between two partners regulates human-human interaction and is a sign of social engagement. This paper investigates whether implementing mutual gaze in robotic systems can achieve social effects, thus to improve human robot interaction. Based on insights from existing human face-to-face interaction studies, we implemented an interactive mutual gaze model in an embodied agent, the social robot head Furhat. We evaluated the mutual gaze prototype with 24 participants in three applications. Our results show that our mutual gaze model improves social connectedness between robots and users.

AB  - Gaze information provides indication of users focus which complements remote collaboration tasks, as distant users can see their partner’s focus. In this paper, we apply gaze for co-located collaboration, where users’ gaze locations are presented on the same display, to help collaboration between partners. We integrated various types of gaze indicators on the user interface of a collaborative search system, and we conducted two user studies to understand how gaze enhances coordination and communication between co-located users. Our results show that gaze indeed enhances co-located collaboration, but with a trade-off between visibility of gaze indicators and user distraction. Users acknowledged that seeing gaze indicators eases communication, because it let them be aware of their partner’s interests and attention. However, users can be reluctant to share their gaze information due to trust and privacy, as gaze potentially divulges their interests.

BT  - Data Driven Approaches in Digital Education
SP  - 238
EP  - 253
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - When watching an educational video, our eyes look for relevant information related to the topic that is being explained at that particular moment. Studying the learners’ gaze behavior and particularly how it correlates with their performance, we have found a series of results, which converge to an understanding about learner behavior that is more abstracted than the use situation or the studied learning contexts. In this contribution we present “Looking Through vs. Looking At” as a generative intermediate-level body of knowledge, and show how it can construct a Strong Concept (as developed by Höök [10]) in technology enhanced learning (TEL). “Looking At”, simply put, refers to missing the relevant information because of either looking at the incorrect place or lagging behind the teacher in time. “Looking Through”, on the other hand, is the success in finding the relevant displayed information at the right moment such that the communication, through verbal and visual channels, becomes synchronous. The visual medium becomes transparent and the learning experience shifts from interacting with the material to interacting with the teacher. We define formally and show how to quantify the proposed strong concept in dyadic interaction scenarios. This concept is applicable to MOOC video interaction, but also to other learning scenarios such as (collaborative) problem solving. We put a particular emphasis on the generative aspect of the concept and demonstrate, with examples, how it can help designing solutions for interactive learning situations.

AB  - Research investigating cognitive aspects of information systems is often dependent on detail–rich data. Eye–trackers promise to provide respective data, but the associated costs are often beyond the researchers’ budget. Recently, eye–trackers have entered the market that promise eye–tracking support at a reasonable price. In this work, we explore whether such eye–trackers are of use for information systems research and explore the accuracy of a low–cost eye–tracker (Gazepoint GP3) in an empirical study. The results show that Gazepoint GP3 is well suited for respective research, given that experimental material acknowledges the limits of the eye–tracker. To foster replication and comparison of results, all data, experimental material as well as the source code developed for this study are made available online.

Focusing on three different private shopping applications / mobile sites in Turkey, a qualitative mobile usability test, based on a multi-method approach, was carried out with a sample of 11 Turkish senior year university students, who were experienced mobile Internet users and potential customers of private shopping platforms. The participants were observed during the task executions and additional data was collected by the “think aloud” procedure, eye-tracking and video recording of the participants. A short debriefing interview was also made to gain a detailed insight into the user experience. The findings revealed significant mobile usability problems and enabled to propose guidelines to improve user experience in mobile private shopping.

AB  - Accurate point detection on image data is an important task for many applications, such as in robot perception, scene understanding, gaze point regression in eye tracking, head pose estimation, or object outline estimation. In addition, it can be beneficial for various object detection tasks where minimal bounding boxes are searched and the method can be applied to each corner. We propose a novel self training method, Multiple Annotation Maturation (MAM) that enables fully automatic labeling of large amounts of image data. Moreover, MAM produces detectors, which can be used online afterward. We evaluated our algorithm on data from different detection tasks for eye, pupil center (head mounted and remote), and eyelid outline point and compared the performance to the state-of-the-art. The evaluation was done on over 300,000 images, and our method shows outstanding adaptability and robustness. In addition, we contribute a new dataset with more than 16,200 accurate manually-labeled images from the remote eyelid, pupil center, and pupil outline detection. This dataset was recorded in a prototype car interior equipped with all standard tools, posing various challenges to object detection such as reflections, occlusion from steering wheel movement, or large head movements. The data set and library are available for download at http://ti.uni-tuebingen.de/Projekte.1801.0.html.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this paper, we present the preliminary steps conducted in the framework of the research project Mitigating Negative Impacts of Monitoring high levels of Automation (MINIMA). The main objectives of MINIMA are (i) to develop vigilance and attention neuro-physiological indexes, and (ii) to implement them in a system that can adapt its behavior and guide the operator’s attention. The goal is to mitigate negative impacts of the foreseen increasing automation in future Air Traffic Control (ATC) scenarios on Air Traffic Controller (ATCo) performance. The first step of research activities consists of better comprehension of Out-Of-The-Loop (OOTL) phenomena and of current methods to measure and compensate such effects. Based on this State of the Art, we propose the MINIMA concept, i.e. a dynamic adaptation of the task environment which is foreseen as a major requirement to keep the human ‘in the loop’, perfectly aware of the traffic situation. In the second part of this paper, we give details about the highly automated Terminal Manoeuvring Area selected as case study. Additionally, we describe the adaptation mechanisms that are planned to be implemented into this task environment and analyzed in the MINIMA project. Finally, the document provides information about the technical implementation of the vigilance and attention measurement that will be used to trigger adaptation of the task environment.

EP  - 6345
VL  - 75
IS  - 11
AB  - The MORE system is designed for observation and machine-aided analysis of social interaction in real life situations, such as classroom teaching scenarios and business meetings. The system utilizes a multichannel approach to collect data whereby multiple streams of data in a number of different modalities are obtained from each situation. Typically the system collects a 360-degree video and audio feed from multiple microphones set up in the space. The system includes an advanced server backend component that is capable of performing video processing, feature extraction and archiving operations on behalf of the user. The feature extraction services form a key part of the system and rely on advanced signal analysis techniques, such as speech processing, motion activity detection and facial expression recognition in order to speed up the analysis of large data sets. The provided web interface weaves the multiple streams of information together, utilizes the extracted features as metadata on the audio and video data and lets the user dive into analyzing the recorded events. The objective of the system is to facilitate easy navigation of multimodal data and enable the analysis of the recorded situations for the purposes of, for example, behavioral studies, teacher training and business development. A further unique feature of the system is its low setup overhead and high portability as the lightest MORE setup only requires a laptop computer and the selected set of sensors on site.

TI  - MPML3D: A Reactive Framework for the Multimodal Presentation Markup Language
BT  - Intelligent Virtual Agents
SP  - 218
EP  - 229
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - MPML3D is our first candidate of the next generation of authoring languages aimed at supporting digital content creators in providing highly appealing and highly interactive content with little effort. The language is based on our previously developed family of Multimodal Presentation Markup Languages (MPML) that broadly followed the “sequential” and “parallel” tagging structure scheme for generating pre-synchronized presentations featuring life-like characters and interactions with the user. The new markup language MPML3D deviates from this design framework and proposes a reactive model instead, which is apt to handle interaction-rich scenarios with highly realistic 3D characters. Interaction in previous versions of MPML could be handled only at the cost of considerable scripting effort due to branching. By contrast, MPML3D advocates a reactive model that allows perceptions of other characters or the user interfere with the presentation flow at any time, and thus facilitates natural and unrestricted interaction. MPML3D is designed as a powerful and flexible language that is easy-to-use by non-experts, but it is also extensible as it allows content creators to add functionality such as a narrative model by using popular scripting languages.

SP  - 17

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper contributes to our understanding of how to design learning analytics to capture and analyse collaborative problem-solving (CPS) in practice-based learning activities. Most research in learning analytics focuses on student interaction in digital learning environments, yet still most learning and teaching in schools occurs in physical environments. Investigation of student interaction in physical environments can be used to generate observable differences among students, which can then be used in the design and implementation of Learning Analytics. Here, we present several original methods for identifying such differences in groups CPS behaviours. Our data set is based on human observation, hand position (fiducial marker) and heads direction (face recognition) data from eighteen students working in six groups of three. The results show that the high competent CPS groups spend an equal distribution of time on their problem-solving and collaboration stages. Whereas, the low competent CPS groups spend most of their time in identifying knowledge and skill deficiencies only. Moreover, as machine observable data shows, high competent CPS groups present symmetrical contributions to the physical tasks and present high synchrony and individual accountability values. The findings have significant implications on the design and implementation of future learning analytics systems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to derive empirical knowledge of the visual search strategies of computer users who suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This was accomplished by recording eye movement during the use of feature-enhanced software. The results from this study show that there are differences between users who have AMD and users who are fully sighted (FS). Detailed analyses confirmed the hypotheses that there would be performance differences between the AMD and FS participants, and that specific features of the interface, namely icon size, background color, and the number of icons on a display, would significantly affect the search strategies of users.

SP  - 343

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - With an advent of the VR market, using 360-degree cameras to create Cinematic VR (CVR) experiences opened up a prominent question that can challenge the traditional film narratology. Additional fields of view are allowed so the viewers in CVR can move their heads to choose more attentive and informative scenes, but frequent scene changes are not welcomed due to VR nausea. These technical drawbacks (and/or advantages) demand a new narratology for CVR, in particular, how the director of CVR can convey certain narratives to the viewers in conjunction with how he/she can attract the viewers to look at the acting persons in the 360-degree scenes. In this study, we employed well-established underpinnings of both eye contact and gaze, by which the acting persons in CVR can effectively convey the narrative structure, and, at the same time, more attentiveness from the viewer in CVR can be ensured. We completed two versions of CVR, one with the traditional film narratology and the other for the new CVR narratology (i.e., eye contact and gaze) proposed in this article, and are now in the stage of evaluation. Our preliminary results showed that the viewers in the CVR film with more eye contact and gazes effectively presented the narratives of the film and also were more satisfied with the CVR environment.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - There have been numerous studies related to useful field of view with regard to ensuring safety during activities and preventing recognition failures that can result in human error. As a result, the form of the useful field of view has been determined and methods for its measurement have been proposed. Most studies have assumed a fixed gaze, however, thus failing to consider the useful field of view during eye movement. The present research takes an experimental approach toward discovering the effects of eye movement speed and direction on useful field of view, limiting eye movement speed to 30°/s. As a result, the direction of gaze movement, increases in speed, and the direction of the recognized object with respect to the focal point cause variation in the narrowing of the useful field of view.

AB  - In this text we present the results of oculometric experiment consisting the registration of anitsaccades of patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) in relation to their neurological data. PD is an important and incurable neurodegenerative disease and we are looking for methods optimizing the treatment. In our previous works we used Reflexive Saccades (RS) and Pursuit Ocular Movements (POM) to check what it can tell us about the disease’s progression expressed in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The UPDRS is the most commonly used scale in the clinical studies of Parkinson’s disease. In this experiment we examined antisaccades (AS) of 11 PD patients who performed eye movement tests in controlled conditions. We correlated neurological measurements of patient’s motoric abilities and data describing their treatment with values of AS parameters. We used RSES and for prediction of the UPDRS scoring groups and Weka methods for presentation of the results. We achieved good results with accuracy of 91% and coverage of 100%. The AS test is a relatively easy and non-invasive method that can be used in the telemedicine in the future.

SP  - 346

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Measuring organizational UX Capability/Maturity (UXCM) has been difficult or inaccurate. Moreover, the lack of empirically developed maturity models, models validated in practice, studies demonstrating their benefit and poor documentation or support for their use, has made this measurement even more problematic. To date, there is no straightforward and efficient method to assess UXCM although such assessment is a prerequisite for the improvement of UX processes. UX artifacts, methods and resources contribute toward the execution of UX processes: the production of UX artifacts demonstrate the execution of a process, whereas the use of UX methods demonstrates the implementation of specific UX processes with specific UX resources. In this paper, we present a measurement structure aiming at assessing organizational capabilities to implement UX processes. This structure consists of a capability scale, a maturity scale, a rating scale and a set of process attributes as measurable characteristics of UX processes. The contribution of this paper is threefold: a description of the measurement structure for the UXCM assessment, a questionnaire for the capability assessment by means of online survey or remote interviews and the documentation of a case study demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed model in an industrial project.

AB  - Our lab has conducted experimental evaluations of ASL animations, which can increase accessibility of information for signers with lower literacy in written languages. Participants watch animations and answer carefully engineered questions about the information content. Because of the labor-intensive nature of our current evaluation approach, we seek techniques for measuring user’s reactions to animations via eye-tracking technology. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between various metrics of eye movement behavior of native ASL signers as they watch various types of stimuli: videos of human signers, high-quality animations of ASL, and lower-quality animations of ASL. We found significant relationships between the quality of the stimulus and the proportional fixation time on the upper and lower portions of the signers face, the transitions between these portions of the face and the rest of the signer’s body, and the total length of the eye fixation path. Our work provides guidance to researchers who wish to evaluate the quality of sign language animations: to enable more efficient evaluation of animation quality to support the development of technologies to synthesize high-quality ASL animations for deaf users.

TI  - Measuring the impact of lexical and structural inconsistencies on developers’ cognitive load during bug localization
JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
AB  - A large portion of the cost of any software lies in the time spent by developers in understanding a program’s source code before any changes can be undertaken. Measuring program comprehension is not a trivial task. In fact, different studies use self-reported and various psycho-physiological measures as proxies. In this research, we propose a methodology using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking devices as an objective measure of program comprehension that allows researchers to conduct studies in environments close to real world settings, at identifier level of granularity. We validate our methodology and apply it to study the impact of lexical, structural, and readability issues on developers’ cognitive load during bug localization tasks. Our study involves 25 undergraduate and graduate students and 21 metrics. Results show that the existence of lexical inconsistencies in the source code significantly increases the cognitive load experienced by participants not only on identifiers involved in the inconsistencies but also throughout the entire code snippet. We did not find statistical evidence that structural inconsistencies increase the average cognitive load that participants experience, however, both types of inconsistencies result in lower performance in terms of time and success rate. Finally, we observe that self-reported task difficulty, cognitive load, and fixation duration do not correlate and appear to be measuring different aspects of task difficulty.

The subsequent sections then present some ideas for building key components of cognition (language, sound, and vision). The main point of this chapter is to illustrate how we can now proceed towards the mechanization of key elements of cognition. This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar with the concepts, terminology, and mathematics of elementary confabulation (as described in Chaps. 1–6 and the DVD video presentation) and its hypothesized biological implementation in the human cerebral cortex and thalamus (as described in Chaps. 3, 5, and 8).

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Incorporating faces into mediated discussions is a complex design problem. The face conveys social and personal identity; it reports fleeting changes of emotion and the cumulative effects of often repeated expressions. The face both expresses and betrays: it shows what the person wishes to convey - and much more. We are highly attuned to recognizing and interpreting faces (though these interpretations are very subjective). Incorporating faces into mediated environments can be quite desirable: it helps the participants gain a stronger sense of their community and can potentially provide finely nuanced expression. Yet there are significant disadvantages and difficulties. The immediate identifying markers revealed by the face, e.g. race, gender, age, are not necessarily the initial information one wants to have of others in an ideal society. And much can be lost in the path from user’s thought to input device to output rendering. This essay discusses key social, cognitive and technical issues involved in incorporating faces in mediated communication.

TI  - Mental workload evaluation and its application in train driving multitasking scheduling: a Timed Petri Net-based model
JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
AB  - Mental workload (MW) plays an important role in the task design of safety–critical systems, which varies across different operators in a given task and affects the performance. It is still a problem to provide a quantitative definition of MW and apply it to the system task optimization design more effectively. Based on this idea, this paper presents a Timed Petri Net (TPN)-based MW evaluation model. The departure phase multitasking scheduling of train driving was treated as an application to concretely represent how does the model improve task design and performance based on the MW evaluation results of individuals. A validation experiment was deployed in a driving simulator, and the Euclidean distance between MW and reaction time was taken as the index of task optimization. Results indicate that the index of the optimized task has a lower value than the original, which means participants achieve a better balance between MW and reaction time in the optimized task design. Besides the design of driver advisory systems, the method is expected to be useful for improving the evaluation accuracy and application efficiency of MW.

AB  - Metacognitive experience (ME) is one of the key facets of metacognition, which serves a critical cuing function in the process of self-regulated learning process. However, the study of ME is hindered by its subjective and implicit nature of and the challenges that are associated with accessing such experiences. In exploring such experiences, eye-tracking offers certain advantages over self-reporting methods. However, to date most studies tend to focus on utilizing eye-tracking to explore metacognitive skills (MS) rather than ME, with those that do explore ME also tending to require participants to self-report rather than relying on observation of possible behavioural indicators of such metacognitive processes. Based on previous works in this field, the research proposed is based on the hypothesis that eye-tracking data can provide a crucial objective measure of learners’ implicit ME processes. The research will also investigate the extent to which such data can serve as the basis for automatically predicting the occurrence and intensity of ME during learning using machine learning, in a way that can support the delivery of adaptive domain-independent feedback in a variety of Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs).

AB  - Unconscious attention shift triggered by a subliminal cue has been shown to be automatic; however, whether it can be brought into effect for images of real-world scenes remains to be investigated. We present a subliminal cueing method that flashes briefly a visual cue before presenting a real-world image to the viewer. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments using three types of cues (spatial cue, face cue, and object cue) of varied durations. Results show that depending on the cue type, the viewer’s visual attention is directed to the cued visual hemifield or the cued location without engaging the viewer’s awareness. The experiments demonstrate that a brief subliminal cue presented prior to the color image of a real-world complex scene can attract human visual attention. The method is useful for many applications that require efficient, unresisting attention shift to a target image area.

AB  - Eye gaze plays a very important role in identifying human’s attention, so it has been considered to be applied in human computer interaction, and one of the main factors in hindering eye gaze application is the complexity of systems and detection method of gaze direction. To build up an eye gaze tracking human-computer interaction system with simple infrastructure and good usability, a kind of gaze direction evaluating approach based on eyes moving trend has been proposed, and the eyes image and feature information are respectively captured and extracted with a Web camera and a computer, and the quantity of eyes moving trend is defined by the ratio of the distances from iris center to the both corners in one eye. Moreover, the image processing algorithms have been provided to detect the characteristics in the image of eyes area, and the eye corners equivalent position detection method has been put up with respect to the shape of eye corners. Some experiments have been done in the test system, and the results show that the proposed methods and algorithms can meet the communication demands for different subjects in multi type work conditions; after completing the initialization, the subjects can freely interact with the computer in a certain work range, and there is no need to frequently calibrate the work parameters, so the limitations to the subjects have been decreased and the system is easy to use, furthermore, it provides a new way for eye gaze tracking technology applied for caring the old and the disability.

AB  - Interactions among road users play an important role for road safety and fluent traffic. In order to design appropriate interaction strategies for automated vehicles, observational studies were conducted in Athens (Greece), Munich (Germany), Leeds (UK) and in Rockville, MD (USA). Naturalistic behaviour was studied, as it may expose interesting scenarios not encountered in controlled conditions. Video and LiDAR recordings were used to extract kinematic information of all road users involved in an interaction and to develop appropriate kinematic models that can be used to predict other’s behaviour or plan the behaviour of an automated vehicle. Manual on-site observations of interactions provided additional behavioural information that may not have been visible via the overhead camera or LiDAR recordings. Verbal protocols were also applied to get a more direct recording of the human thought process. Real-time verbal reports deliver a richness of information that is inaccessible by purely quantitative data but they may pose excessive cognitive workload and remain incomplete. A retrospective commentary was applied in complex traffic environment, which however carries an increased risk of omission, rationalization and reconstruction. This is why it was applied while the participants were watching videos from their eye gaze recording. The commentaries revealed signals and cues used in interactions and in drivers’ decision-making, that cannot be captured by objective methods. Multiple methods need to be combined, objective and qualitative ones, depending on the specific objectives of each future study.

AB  - Evaluation is an essential part of development. There are several good reasons for carrying out user testing in particular. A successful evaluation requires careful planning. Here we describe the issues that you need to take into account and discuss several effective methods that can be used to collect data. User testing reduces the risk that you will deliver a system to your users that is unusable and is therefore ineffective. We also touch briefly on the need make sure that any evaluation that you carry out is conducted according to appropriate ethical guidelines.

BT  - Foundations of Augmented Cognition
SP  - 401
EP  - 409
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The potential for bias to affect the results of knowledge elicitation studies is well recognized. Researchers and knowledge engineers attempt to control for bias through careful selection of elicitation and analysis methods. Recently, the development of a wide range of physiological sensors, coupled with fast, portable and inexpensive computing platforms, has added an additional dimension of objective measurement that can reduce bias effects. In the case of an abductive reasoning task, bias can be introduced through design of the stimuli, cues from researchers, or omissions by the experts. We describe a knowledge elicitation methodology robust to various sources of bias, incorporating objective and cross-referenced measurements. The methodology was applied in a study of engineers who use multivariate time series data to diagnose the performance of devices throughout the production lifecycle. For visual reasoning tasks, eye tracking is particularly effective at controlling for biases of omission by providing a record of the subject’s attention allocation.

AB  - Certain features of a video Baluch, FarhanItti, Laurentcapture human attention and this can be measured by recording eye movements of a viewer. Using this technique combined with extraction of various types of features from video frames, one can begin to understand what features of a video may drive attention. In this chapter we define and assess different types of feature channels that can be computed from video frames, and compare the output of these channels to human eye movements. This provides us with a measure of how well a particular feature of a video can drive attention. We then examine several types of channel combinations and learn a set of weightings of features that can best explain human eye movements. A linear combination of features with high weighting on motion and color channels was most predictive of eye movements on a public dataset.

VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Programming mistakes frequently waste software developers’ time and may lead to the introduction of bugs into their software, causing serious risks for their customers. Using the correlation between various software process metrics and defects, earlier work has traditionally attempted to spot such bug risks. However, this study departs from previous works in examining a more direct method of using psycho-physiological sensors data to detect the difficulty of program comprehension tasks and programmer level of expertise. By conducting a study with 38 expert and novice programmers, we investigated how well an electroencephalography and an eye-tracker can be utilized in predicting programmer expertise (novice/expert) and task difficulty (easy/difficult). Using data from both sensors, we could predict task difficulty and programmer level of expertise with 64.9 and 97.7% precision and 68.6 and 96.4% recall, respectively. The result shows it is possible to predict the perceived difficulty of a task and expertise level for developers using psycho-physiological sensors data. In addition, we found that while using single biometric sensor shows good results, the composition of both sensors lead to the best overall performance.

TI  - Mining reading patterns from eye-tracking data: method and demonstration
JO  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - Understanding how developers interact with different software artifacts when performing comprehension tasks has a potential to improve developers’ productivity. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze eye-tracking data using process mining to find distinct reading patterns of how developers interacted with the different artifacts. To validate our approach, we conducted an exploratory study using eye-tracking involving 11 participants. We applied our method to investigate how developers interact with different artifacts during domain and code understanding tasks. To contextualize the reading patterns and to better understand the perceived benefits and challenges participants associated with the different artifacts and their choice of reading patterns, we complemented the eye-tracking data with the data obtained from think aloud. The study used behavior-driven development, a development practice that is increasingly used in Agile software development contexts, as a setting. The study shows that our method can be used to explore developers’ behavior at an aggregated level and identify behavioral patterns at varying levels of granularity.

VL  - 15
IS  - 3
AB  - The proliferation of smartphones in the last decade and the number of publications in the field of authoring systems for computer-assisted learning depict a scenario that needs to be explored in order to facilitate the scaffolding of learning activities across contexts. Learning resources are traditionally designed in desktop-based authoring systems where the context is mostly restricted to the learning objective, capturing relevant case characteristics, or virtual situation models. Mobile authoring tools enable learners and teachers to foster universal access to educational resources not only providing channels to share, remix, or recontextualize these, but also capturing the context in situ and in time. As a further matter, authoring educational resources in a mobile context is an authentic experience where authors can link learning with their own daily life activities and reflections. The contribution of this manuscript is fourfold: First, the main barriers for ubiquitous and mobile authoring of educational resources are identified; second, recent research on mobile authoring tools is reviewed, and 10 key shortcomings of current approaches are identified; third, the design of a mobile environment to author educational resources (MAT for ARLearn) is presented, and the results of an evaluation of usability and hedonic quality are presented; fourth, conclusions and a research agenda for mobile authoring are discussed.

SP  - 883

VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - Assistive Technology (AT) revolutionized the process of learning for special needs students during the past three decades. Thanks to this technology, accessibility and educational inclusion became attainable more than any time in the history of special education. Meanwhile, assistive technology devices remain unreachable for a large number of students with disabilities, especially in under-developed and developing countries like Morocco due to a number of factors, especially, availability and affordability. Mobile learning, using smartphones and tablets in particular, may provide alternative solutions as special education tools in such countries. Additionally, open source platforms, particularly Google play store with all the applications it accommodates for disabled people, may obviate the need for monofunctional, sometimes expensive, AT devices. The present paper sets out to investigate potentials of using smartphones and tablets as alternative learning tools for assistive technology devices within formal and informal learning environments. It compares seven free Google Play medical apps with seven assistive technology devices at the level of functionality and affordability. The apps are of relevance to cases of physical as well as mental disabilities, namely hearing impairment, visual impairment, autism and speech articulation disorders.

The meaning of these elements depends on structural properties of the arguments, e.g. being an uninstantiated variable or a ground term when the goal is called, or involve success / failure conditions for the components which relates them to control. To model these effects we use a substructural calculus and introduce a binding mechanism at the level of sequents called freezing.

AB  - With the growing number of conversational systems that find their way in our daily life, new questions and challenges arise. Even though natural conversation with agent-based systems has been improved in the recent years, e.g., by better speech recognition algorithms, they still lack the ability to understand nonverbal behavior and conversation dynamics—a key part of human natural interaction. To make a step towards intuitive and natural interaction with virtual agents, social robots, and other conversational systems, this chapter proposes a probabilistic framework that models the dynamics of interpersonal cues reflecting the user’s social attitude within the context they occur.

TI  - Modeling cognitive load and physiological arousal through pupil diameter and heart rate
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - This study investigates individuals’ cognitive load processing abilities while engaged on a decision-making task in serious games, to explore how a substantial cognitive load dominates over the physiological arousal effect on pupil diameter. A serious game was presented to the participants, which displayed the on–line biofeedback based on physiological measurements of arousal. In such dynamic decision-making environment, the pupil diameter was analyzed in relation to the heart rate, to evaluate if the former could be a useful measure of cognitive abilities of individuals. As pupil might reflect both cognitive activity and physiological arousal, the pupillary response will show an arousal effect only when the cognitive demands of the situation are minimal. Evidence shows that in a situation where a substantial level of cognitive activity is required, only that activity will be observable on the pupil diameter, dominating over the physiological arousal effect indicated by the pupillary response. It is suggested that it might be possible to design serious games tailored to the cognitive abilities of an individual player, using the proposed physiological measurements to observe the moment when such dominance occurs.

AB  - In this study, we modeled customer purchasing behavior in a retail store using a Bayesian network-based probabilistic modeling tool to apply towards improving merchandise display and package design. The following four aspects of purchasing behavior were examined: purchasing gestures, glances made during the selection of merchandise, customer psychology concerning purchasing, and body information, including age, height, gender, eyesight, and dominant hand. To monitor purchasing behavior, three college students fitted with an eye tracker were asked to select the most appealing product among twenty-five snack food products that were displayed on five-tier shelving. Factors affecting customers’ merchandise selection in the experimental retail store were then computed using a Bayesian network, and a purchasing behavior model was constructed from the results. Using the constructed model, a method of effective merchandise display based on the characteristics of retail purchasing behavior was proposed.

BT  - Transforming Learning with Meaningful Technologies
SP  - 450
EP  - 465
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Most of the contemporary approaches in learner behaviour modelling either quantize continuous data into discrete states/events (e.g., HMM), or assume that the patterns in the data are distributed homogeneously in time (e.g., auto-regression). This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes the above mentioned issues and models learner behaviour using Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH). GARCH uses continuous time-series data, without the need for information quantization, and it considers the heterogeneity of event distribution in the time-series. A study was conducted to demonstrate how GARCH can be configured in an adaptive assessment setting. Specifically, GARCH was applied on six different constructs from eye-tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and compared with existing methods of modelling time-series data, such as Markov Models and models having auto-regressive components. The comparison shows that the models having a GARCH component outperform other models for most of the students, for all the variables considered. The results are encouraging towards building accurate learner behaviour models, adequate to drive the design and development of adaptive feedback tools (e.g., an early alert system), but further investigation is required.

SP  - 56

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Mobility models are used to mimic the realistic movement of entities. Mobility models for wireless networks feature different objectives and characteristics, most based on random behaviour. However, random based mobility models, e.g. Random Waypoint (RWP), are often not suitable to represent the reality of node mobility, particularly in disaster areas where the search time for victims is a critical factor. Moreover, the studied mobility models for disaster environments are either random based or not suitable for such scenarios. This work proposes a new mobility model based on Human Behaviour for Disaster Areas (HBDA) to properly evaluate the performance of mobile wireless networks in disaster environments. HBDA is designed to cover as much area as possible, regarding search time as an important factor. This work evaluates HBDA concerning movement and link performances. Results show that HBDA provides an even distribution of nodes, a high coverage area and an efficient routing performance.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Monitoring an individual’s mental state using unobtrusively measured signals is regarded as an essential element in symbiotic human-machine systems. However, it is not straightforward to model the relation between mental state and such signals in real life, without resorting to (unnatural) emotion induction. We recorded heart rate, facial expression and computer activity of nineteen participants while working at the computer for ten days. In order to obtain ‘ground truth’ emotional state, participants indicated their current emotion using a valence-arousal affect grid every 15 min. We found associations between valence/arousal and the unobtrusively measured variables. There was some first success to predict subjective valence/arousal using personal classification models. Thus, real-life office emotions appear to vary enough, and can be reported well enough, to uncover relations with unobtrusively measured variables. This is required to be able to monitor individuals in real life more fine-grained than the frequency with which emotion is probed.

Further, since data mining requires a significant sample size to accurately model patterns in the data, algorithms that automatically extract motion trajectories and time series data from video are required. A preliminary system for estimating human motion in video, as well as indexing and data mining of the resulting motion databases is described.

AB  - Team performance is a function, in part, of team cohesion: a dynamic process that is reflected in the tendency of a group to remain united in the pursuit of its goals and objectives (Carron 1982). We propose that a multi-modal measurement approach that integrates data from a variety of sources is critical to forming a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between team cohesion and performance, and can afford measurement of the hard-to-assess social component of team cohesion. Moreover, the use of a multi-modal measurement technique can afford flexibility in measuring across a variety of environments and selecting the most relevant measurement tools to minimize the technical footprint required for the assessment of teams and individuals in an operational environment.

AB  - Making connections between graphical representations is integral to learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) fields. However, students often fail to make these connections spontaneously. ITSs are suitable tools to support connection making. Yet, when designing an ITS for connection making, we need to investigate what learning processes and concepts play a role within the specific domain. We describe a multi-methods approach for grounding ITS design in the specific requirements of the target domain. Specifically, we applied this approach to an ITS for connection making in chemistry. We used a theoretical framework that describes potential target learning processes and conducted two empirical studies – using tests, eye tracking, and interviews – to investigate how these learning processes play out in the chemistry domain. We illustrate how our findings inform the design of a chemistry tutor. Initial pilot study results suggest that the ITS promotes learning processes that are productive in chemistry.

AB  - Users with severe motor impairment often depends on alternative input devices like eye-gaze or head movement trackers to access computers. However these devices are not as fast as computer mouse and often turn difficult to use. We have proposed a Neural-network based model that can predict pointing target by analyzing pointing trajectory. We have validated the model for standard computer mouse, eye-gaze and head movement trackers. The model is used to develop an adaptation system that can statistically significantly reduce pointing times.

TI  - Multi-modal indicators for estimating perceived cognitive load in post-editing of machine translation
JO  - Machine Translation
SP  - 91
EP  - 115
VL  - 33
IS  - 1
AB  - In this paper, we develop a model that uses a wide range of physiological and behavioral sensor data to estimate perceived cognitive load (CL) during post-editing (PE) of machine translated (MT) text. By predicting the subjectively reported perceived CL, we aim to quantify the extent of demands placed on the mental resources available during PE. This could for example be used to better capture the usefulness of MT proposals for PE, including the mental effort required, in contrast to the mere closeness to a reference perspective that current MT evaluation focuses on. We compare the effectiveness of our physiological and behavioral features individually and in combination with each other and with the more traditional text and time features relevant to the task. Many of the physiological and behavioral features have not previously been applied to PE. Based on the data gathered from ten participants, we show that our multi-modal measurement approach outperforms all baseline measures in terms of predicting the perceived level of CL as measured by a psychological scale. Combinations of eye-, skin-, and heart-based indicators enhance the results over each individual measure. Additionally, adding PE time improves the regression results further. An investigation of correlations between the best performing features, including sensor features previously unexplored in PE, and the corresponding subjective ratings indicates that the multi-modal approach takes advantage of several weakly to moderately correlated features to combine them into a stronger model.

AB  - The electronic typesetting of a document written in a language other than English is a problem that has been tackled seriously by the TEX community. A complete solution to this problem involves the solution of two subproblems: the preparation of the LATEX file and the typesetting of this file according to the typographic idiosyncrasies of the (main) language of the document. There are at least three different approaches to this really complicated problem:The use of standard LATEX packages (i.e., packages that suppose the use of TEX as the underlying typesetting engine and allow multilingual text processing in a portable way). The main drawback of this approach is that in many cases the user has to type commands that seem unnatural.The use of customized typsetting engines, such as pTEX, that are based on TEX and take care of most peculiarities of a particular language. The main drawback of this approach is that it is not adequate for documents written in languages other than the native language of the customized typesetting engine.Standard TEX extensions, such as ɛ-TEX and Ω, which have been designed to allow true multilingual typesetting. The drawback of this approach is that these systems have not gained really wide acceptance, mainly because their documentation is still under development.

AB  - This paper concerns the multimodal inference of complex mental states in the intelligent tutoring domain. The research aim is to provide intervention strategies in response to a detected mental state, with the goal being to keep the student in a positive affect realm to maximize learning potential. The research follows an ethnographic approach in the determination of affective states that naturally occur between students and computers. The multimodal inference component will be evaluated from video and audio recordings taken during classroom sessions. Further experiments will be conducted to evaluate the affect component and educational impact of the intelligent tutor.

AB  - No matter how well hidden our systems are and how well they do their magic unnoticed in the background, there are times when direct interaction between system and human is a necessity. As long as the interaction can take place unobtrusively and without techno-clutter, this is desirable. It is hard to picture a means of interaction less obtrusive and techno-cluttered than spoken communication on human terms. Spoken face-to-face communication is the most intuitive and robust form of communication between humans imaginable. In order to exploit such human spoken communication to its full potential as an interface between human and machine, we need a much better understanding of how the more human-like aspects of spoken communication work.

AB  - Difficulties in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communications as well as repetitive and atypical patterns of behavior, are typical characteristics of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Advances in computer and robotic technology are enabling assistive technologies for intervention in psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). A number of research studies indicate that many children with ASD prefer technology and this preference can be explored to develop systems that may alleviate several challenges of traditional treatment and intervention. The current work presents development of an adaptive virtual reality-based social interaction platform for children with ASD. It is hypothesized that endowing a technological system that can detect the feeling and mental state of the child and adapt its interaction accordingly is of great importance in assisting and individualizing traditional intervention approaches. The proposed system employs sensors such as eye trackers and physiological signal monitors and models the context relevant psychological state of the child from combination of these sensors. Preliminary affect recognition results indicate that psychological states could be determined from peripheral physiological signals and together with other modalities including gaze and performance of the participant, it is viable to adapt and individualize VR-based intervention paradigms.

AB  - In this paper, we propose that the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) community lead the charge in leveraging multimodal interfaces, in conjunction with artificial intelligence, to advance learning interfaces and experiences that are more inclusive. Recent years has seen the development of various multimodal technologies for capturing voice, gesture and gaze-based input modalities, as well as various forms of auditory and haptic feedback. These modalities could be powerful tools for developing inclusive learning interfaces. To ground this idea, we present a set of examples for how this work can be transformative in democratizing access to technology, while also democratizing designing and building technology. Additionally, our examples reinforce how designing for inclusive learning can result in improved learning interfaces for the general population.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Within the next decade multimodal neural interfaces (MNI’s) could begin to transform society by expanding human cognitive abilities. Embodiments of such interfaces will include a combination of biometric and environmental sensors working in cooperation with noninvasive brain stimulation or neuromodulation devices to optimize human cognitive processes. These MNI’s may, for example, monitor psychophysiological arousal using pupillometry and responsively stimulate noradrenergic activity in a manner to enhance sustained attention or vigilance. Other near-term applications may include MNI’s that are designed to enable an individual to maintain a particular state of calm or flow state during stressful tasks by using algorithms to generate auricular vagal nerve stimulation waveforms based on real-time heart rate variability and electroencephalography data. Numerous other possibilities remain. The present paper provides a brief overview of several different types of biometric sensors and the neurophysiological systems they can monitor. This information is provided in context of their present limitations, as well as how neurophysiological sensors may be used in combination with noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods to augment human cognition and performance. Overall the paper attempts to provide a balanced and realistic examination of the issues remaining to be solved or addressed in order to reliably enhance human cognition. Efforts that combine high quality sensors for monitoring neurophysiological signatures of attention and psychophysiological markers of arousal with scientifically-grounded neurostimulation approaches in an integrated MNI solution will be necessary to achieve reliable and reproducible cognitive augmentation facilitated by future MNI’s.

AB  - An experimental multimodal system, designed for polysensory diagnosis and stimulation of persons with impaired communication skills or even non-communicative subjects is presented. The user interface includes an eye tracking device and the EEG monitoring of the subject. Furthermore, the system consists of a device for objective hearing testing and an autostereoscopic projection system designed to stimulate subjects through their immersion in a virtual environment. Data analysis methods are described, and experiments associated with classification of mental states during listening exercises as well as audio-visual stimuli are presented and discussed. Feature extraction was based on discrete wavelet transformation and clustering employing the k-means algorithm was designed. All algorithms were implemented in the Python programming language with the use of Open Source libraries. Tests of the proposed system were performed in a Special School and Educational Center in Kościerzyna, Poland. Results and comparison with data gathered from the control group of healthy people are presented and discussed.

AB  - Spatial augmented reality environments are increasing in many domains. However, from a user-centred perspective we still do not know how to interact with them properly. Thus, there is a need for new interaction concepts. In this paper we discuss certain aspects which are special for the interaction in spatial augmented reality environments. We conclude that the most promising form of interaction will be multimodal and touchless. Additionally it should be taken into account that the user is interacting in a 3D space. Therefore different ways of interaction might be more appropriate for different spaces around the user instead of only one. We give a short review of advantages and disadvantages of touchless and multimodal input devices and then outline spatial aspects of perception and interaction in 3D space.

AB  - Predicting the psychological state of the user using physiological measures is one of the main objectives of physiological computing. While numerous works have addressed this task with great success, a large number of challenges remain to be solved in order to develop recognition approaches that can precisely and reliably feed human-computer interaction systems. This chapter focuses on one of these challenges which is the temporal asynchrony between different physiological signals within one recognition model. The chapter proposes a flexible and suitable method for feature extraction based on empirical optimisation of windows’ latency and duration. The approach is described within the theoretical framework of the psychophysiological inference and its common implementation using machine learning. The method has been experimentally validated (46 subjects) and results are presented. Empirically optimised values for the extraction windows are provided.

AB  - Multisensory information processing is a basic feature of neural systems and has been exploited to facilitate development of Army systems that augment Soldier performance through multisensory displays. However, the full potential of these systems has yet to be determined and will require understanding fundamental features of the underlying neurophysiology of multisensory processing, the neuroergonomics of multisensory machine interface and analytical methods for neural signal analysis, dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition. Here, findings from basic and applied research efforts will be presented that have focused on various aspects of human (brain)-computer interfaces to uncover understanding in these areas and mediate recent technological developments in multisensory display technology, passive mental state detection, attention/orientation detection, and human activities recognition from video in general. Based on the knowledge of multisensory processes acquired from these efforts there are emerging opportunities for creating new human gesture-controlled recognition systems based upon multimodal data analysis which will allow for unprecedented human-machine symbiosis.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to natural demonstration of manipulation skills for multimodal interactive robots. The main focus is on the natural demonstration of manipulation skills, especially grasping skills. In order to teach grasping skills to a multimodal interactive robot, a human instructor makes use of natural spoken language and grasping actions demonstrated to the robot. The proposed approach emphasizes on four different aspects of learning by demonstration: First, the dialog system for processing natural speech is considered. Second, an object detection and classification scheme for the robot is shown. Third, the correspondence problem is addressed by an algorithm for visual tracking of the demonstrator’s hands in real time and the transformation of the tracking results into an approach trajectory for a robotic arm. The fourth aspect addresses the fine-tuning of the robot’s hand configuration for each grasp. It introduces a criterion to evaluate a grasp for stability and possible reuse of a grasped object. The approach produces stable grasps and is applied and evaluated on a multimodal service robot.

PB  - Springer London

AB  - Natural gaze behavior during human-computer interaction provides valuable information about user’s cognitive processes and intentions. Including it as an additional input modality therefore provides great potential to improve human-computer interaction. However, the relation between natural gaze behavior and underlying cognitive processes still is unexplored to a large extend. Additionally, most interaction techniques proposed in recent years which incorporate eye gaze as input modality require the user to consciously diverge from natural gaze behavior in order to trigger certain events. In this paper we present results from two user studies. The first one aims at identifying and characterizing major factors which influence natural gaze behavior during human-computer interaction with a focus on the role of user’s mental model about the interactive system. We investigate how natural gaze behavior can be influenced by interaction design and point out implications for usage of gaze as additional modality in gaze-based interfaces. With the second user study we demonstrate how gaze-based intention estimation based on analysis of natural gaze behavior can be used to improve interaction in multi-display environments.

AB  - Now that virtual reality has finally become a customer ready product, museums can use this new mean to enhance their exhibitions. The main problem however is that such a tool was not thought for casual users, and to adapt this new technology to short experiences such as the ones museums could provide, it is necessary to reduce the adaptation time to the new mean. In this paper, we discuss how removing physical controllers in favour of visually-tracked virtual hands could significantly reduce the time needed by casual users to adapt to new experiences, underlying the current technological limitations both in terms of technology and design.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Humans tend to direct their attention toward the left half of their area of vision, which is known as visual pseudo neglect. Most navigational elements are placed at the left side. However, there is neither a theoretical reasoning nor empirical evidence, why these elements should be placed left. In the present study we examined three independent variables (presentation side of elements (left, right), number of elements (one, three, five) and a visual cue prior to selection (with cue, without). Dependent variables were selection times and accuracy of task completion. 50 participants were exposed to elements consisting of single words in bubbles. After clicking on the start element in the middle of the screen a number of elements were presented randomly on the left or right. In 50% of trials the presentation side was announced in advance, by using a visual cue. It was tested, whether and to what extent there is a preference and performance (correct selection time) increase for elements placed on the left side. When the cue was presented, performance increased; without cue information, elements on the left were selected faster. The use of cues resulted in no significant differences between the left and right side. A significantly better performance was found when only one element was presented on the left. With an increasing number of elements, the performance decreased. The results of this study suggest that the presentation of elements on the left side is advantageous for the speed of information processing only in the case of single elements. When selecting between numbers of options (three, five), placing elements on the left does not affect the selection performance.

AB  - In this paper we present our preliminary findings for the neural correlates of purchasing decisions made in a computerized setting as well as in an ecologically plausible supermarket environment. Participants who were randomly recruited from a database of typical customers maintained by a marketing consultancy company were given a specific budget and asked to make purchasing decisions for basic grocery items in two separate conditions. In the first condition, participants made their decisions in a computerized scenario, where in each trial a single product and its price were displayed for a fixed duration of time, and then the participants clicked on buttons to specify which products they wish to purchase. In the second experiment, participants made similar purchasing decisions while wandering around a custom-made grocery aisle with shelves including physical products. In both conditions participants’ brain activities in their prefrontal cortices as well as their eye movements were recorded wıth a wireless fNIR device and a glass eye tracker respectively. In both conditions we observed higher mean oxygenation levels for the purchase decisions at the left dorso-medial prefrontal cortex. Despite the limited sample size, the oxygenation trends were similar in both purchasing situations. Our preliminary findings suggest that fNIR can effectively be employed to investigate neural correlates of purchasing behavior in ecological settings.

AB  - Preliminary results of a longitudinal study aimed at understanding the neurocognitive correlates of learning in a visual object recognition task are reported. The experimental task used real-world novel stimuli, whereas the control task used real-world familiar stimuli. Participants practiced the tasks over 10 weeks and reached a high level of accuracy. Brain imaging data was acquired in weeks 2, 6, and 10 and eye-tracking data was acquired in the other seven weeks. Quantitative and qualitative changes in brain activity were observed over the course of learning and skill acquisition. Generally, in the experimental task, brain activity increased at week 6 and decreased at week 10, whereas in the control task, brain activity decreased at week 6 and further decreased at week 10 compared to week 2. New clusters of brain activity emerged at week 6 in the experimental task. Eye-fixation and pupil-dilation data showed that fast learners tend to inspect the stimuli more thoroughly even after a response was given. These results are used to inform the development of computational cognitive models of visual object recognition tasks.

There are many parameters that could be manipulated to affect physical fidelity in a simulator and we want to point out that in this study we make no claims of having covered a large portion of the possible fidelity design space. Rather, this study provides a comparison of trainee performance in a low to mid-level simulator with the performance obtained in a real fighter jet training aircraft using state-of-the-art operator state characterization equipment. As this study is ongoing, only partial data is shown in this paper.

AB  - Companies and marketing departments are devoting many resources to the implementation of neuromarketing with facial recognition. This document presents a systematic review of the literature whose main objective was to look for computer systems and technologies of facial recognition that are available to support neuromarketing. As a result, it was found that very few academic and scientific articles focus on this topic in a systematic way. None carry out an analysis for a complete solution and the studies are limited with databases that do not offer a group of images which are sufficiently broad to allow the performance of complete tests. Many works emphasize research on algorithms that increase the level of accuracy of the information analyzed at the time of facial recognition.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Technology continues to advance at exponential rates and we are exposed to a multitude of electronic interfaces in almost every aspect of our lives. In order to achieve seamless integration of both, human and technology, we must examine the objective and subjective responses to such interactions. The goal of this study was to examine neurophysiological responses to movement, communication, and usability with a robot assistant, in comparison to human assistant, in a real-world setting. OSHbot (robot assistants designed by Fellow Robots) were utilized as mobile store clerks to identify and locate merchandise in order to assist customers in finding items within a hardware store. By acquiring neurophysiological measures (electroencephalogram; EEG and electrocardiogram; ECG) of human perception and interaction with robots, we found evidence of Mirror Neuron System (MNS) elicitation and motor imagery processing, which is consistent with other studies examining human-robot interactions. Multiple analyses were conducted to assess differences between human-human interaction and human-robot interaction. Several EEG metrics were identified that were distinguishable based on interaction type; among these was the change observed across the Mu bandwidth (8–13 Hz). The variance in this EEG correlate has been related to empathetic state change. In order to explore differences in the interactions related to gender and age additional analyses were conducted to compare the effects of human-human interaction versus human-robot interaction with data stratified by gender and age. This analysis yielded significant differences across these categories between human-human interaction and human-robot interaction within EEG metrics. These preliminary data show promise for future research in the field of human-robot relations in contributing to the design and implementation of machines that not only deliver basic services but also create a social connection with humans.

AB  - A wide assortment of eye tracking studies can be found in the increasingly related fields of Neuroscience and Psychology. Topics range from basic re?search in vision science to the investigation of visual exploration in aesthetics (e.g., perception of art). A useful approach to navigating through vast collections of early and contemporary literature is to (for the outset) dissociate high-level cognitive studies from those concerned with a low-level functional view of the brain. In this sense, to use a computational analogy, one can distin?guish between the “hardware” (low-level brain circuitry) on which the “software” (high-level cognition) functions. In a complimentary view of the apparently disparate disciplines, neuroscience identifies the physiological components which are ultimately responsible for perception. In the context of vision and eye movements, knowledge of the physiological organization of the optic tract as well as of cognitive and behavioral aspects of vision is indispensable in obtaining a complete understanding of human vision.

AB  - Truly understanding the feelings of a user has always been a dream of user experience (UX) researchers. Current methods for understanding emotional response has been limited to self-reporting from study participants or qualitative methods such as surveys or focus groups. New biometric and neurometric devices allow us to collect behavioral data in ways that were not previously practical for user researchers. This paper will provide an overview of these new technologies and how they can be applied to the study of emotional responses during user experience evaluation.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 645

VL  - 23
IS  - 2
AB  - Interaction traces (ITs) are developers’ logs collected while developers maintain or evolve software systems. Researchers use ITs to study developers’ editing styles and recommend relevant program entities when developers perform changes on source code. However, when using ITs, they make assumptions that may not necessarily be true. This article assesses the extent to which researchers’ assumptions are true and examines noise in ITs. It also investigates the impact of noise on previous studies. This article describes a quasi-experiment collecting both Mylyn ITs and video-screen captures while 15 participants performed four realistic software maintenance tasks. It assesses the noise in ITs by comparing Mylyn ITs and the ITs obtained from the video captures. It proposes an approach to correct noise and uses this approach to revisit previous studies. The collected data show that Mylyn ITs can miss, on average, about 6% of the time spent by participants performing tasks and can contain, on average, about 85% of false edit events, which are not real changes to the source code. The approach to correct noise reveals about 45% of misclassification of ITs. It can improve the precision and recall of recommendation systems from the literature by up to 56% and 62%, respectively. Mylyn ITs include noise that biases subsequent studies and, thus, can prevent researchers from assisting developers effectively. They must be cleaned before use in studies and recommendation systems. The results on Mylyn ITs open new perspectives for the investigation of noise in ITs generated by other monitoring tools such as DFlow, FeedBag, and Mimec, and for future studies based on ITs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify eye movement characteristics during a visual search using nonlinear dynamics (chaos analysis). More concretely, the first Lyapunov exponent and the attractor plot were obtained for the time series data of x- and y-directional eye-gaze locations. An attempt was made to compare the first Lyapunov exponent and the attractor plot during a visual search task as a function of layout complexity of the display and to verify whether chaotic properties existed in the fluctuation of eye-gaze locations, and to examine how the scaling properties change as a function of the layout complexity. First Lyapunov exponent of the time series of eye-gaze locations took positive values, and tended to increase with the increase of search task difficulty (layout complexity). The attractor plot drew a trajectory like an ellipse, and the variation in attractor plots tended to be more complicated with the increase of task difficulty.

In this paper, we present NovA (NOnVerbal behavior Analyzer), a system that analyzes and facilitates the interpretation of social signals conveyed by gestures, facial expressions and others automatically as a basis for computer-enhanced social coaching. NovA records data of human interactions, automatically detects relevant behavioral cues as a measurement for the quality of an interaction and creates descriptive statistics for the recorded data. This enables us to give a user online generated feedback on strengths and weaknesses concerning his social behavior, as well as elaborate tools for offline analysis and annotation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Visualization of eye-tracking data is mainly based on fixations. However, saccade trajectories and their characteristics might contain more information than sole fixation positions. Artists, for example, can influence the way our eyes traverse a picture by employing composition methods. Repetitive saccade trajectories and the sequence of eye movements seem to correlate with this composition. In this work, we propose two novel methods to visualize saccade patterns during static stimulus viewing. The first approach, so-called saccade heatmap, utilizes a modified Gaussian density distribution to highlight frequent gaze paths. The second approach is based on clustering and assigns identical labels to similar saccades to thus filter for the most relevant gaze paths. We demonstrate and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches by examples of free-viewing paintings and compare them to other state-of-the-art visualization techniques.

AB  - Open Source Software (OSS) communities do not often invest in marketing strategies to promote their products in a competitive way. Even the home pages of the web portals of well-known OSS products show technicalities and details that are not relevant for a fast and effective evaluation of the product’s qualities. So, final users and even developers who are interested in evaluating and potentially adopting an OSS product are often negatively impressed by the quality perception they have from the web portal of the product and turn to proprietary software solutions or fail to adopt OSS that may be useful in their activities. In this paper, we define OP2A, an evaluation model and we derive a checklist that OSS developers and web masters can use to design (or improve) their web portals with all the contents that are expected to be of interest for OSS final users. We exemplify the use of the model by applying it to the Apache Tomcat web portal and we apply the model to 47 web sites of well-known OSS products to highlight the current deficiencies that characterize these web portals.

AB  - Existing approaches for object recognition typically rely on images captured on an ordinary digital camera and therefore the recognition task sometimes becomes difficult when the image contains other objects (cluttered) and the object of interest is not clearly indicated. In this work, we integrate a wearable eye tracker into the object recognition system in order to recognize which object the user is paying attention to in the scene camera. To demonstrate the usability of such a gaze based object recognition interface, we developed a prototypical application named Museum Guide 2.0 which can be used in a museum as a mechanical guide for visitors.

AB  - Methods to assess driving degradation due to driver distraction are currently discussed and defined by international standardization groups. A simulator experiment involving 17 participants was conducted to assess the reliability and relevance of one of these methods (Lane Change Test) to discriminate between secondary tasks. In addition to varying age groups, vehicles and secondary tasks, the protocol was also varied to assess the impact of the instruction occurrence and its possible conflict with primary task performance. Results show the limitations of the main parameter proposed by the method (lateral deviation) and question the reliability of the method in its current form. Additional indicators seem necessary to make sense of the respective impact of the varied conditions. Surprisingly, the impact of the instruction occurrence is very limited, apparently because individual strategies have more impact than situations differences.

JO  - Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
SP  - 875
EP  - 916
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
AB  - Knowledge and expertise sharing has long been an important theme in CSCW and, importantly, one that has frequently challenged a prevailing view concerning knowledge management. This critique focused, initially, on the practical problems associated with issues of Organisational Memory (OM), and in particular the difficulties inherent in an oversimplified ‘repository’ model. Attention then turned to issues of contextuality and communication for expertise sharing, drawing on concepts such as communities of practice and social capital to understand, again, the sharing of knowledge and expertise in practice. Here, we report on how particular kinds of ‘embodied action’ can be identified in relation to the potential of cyber-physical infrastructures for knowledge sharing in an industrial context. We argue that, in a complex industrial domain, both the recording of physical movement – ‘showing’ – and the representation of local knowledge – ‘telling’ – are potentially relevant. Our proposal is that the evolution of cyber-physical infrastructures now offers a way of changing some early assumptions about how knowledge might be captured and displayed. We argue that we are entering a third generation of knowledge and expertise sharing research, where the use of augmented reality (AR) and sensor technology will result in significant new methodological innovations, including the capture and sharing of knowledge, embedded in embodied action.

AB  - An eye-tracking study of a prototype website was conducted with 10 younger adults (ages 20-39) and 10 older adults (ages 50-69) to determine if there are differences in how they scan webpages. They performed the same tasks on the website. On the average, the older adults spent 42% more time looking at the content of the pages than did the younger adults. They also spent 51% more time looking at the navigation areas. The pattern of fixations on almost all pages showed that the older adults looked at more parts of the page than did the younger adults. Implications for designing webpages that work well for older adults are provided.

AB  - EagleEyes is a system that allows the user to control the computer through electrodes placed on the head. For people without disabilities it takes 15 to 30 minutes to learn to control the cursor sufficiently to spell out a message with an onscreen keyboard. We currently are working with two dozen children with profound disabilities to teach them to use EagleEyes to control computer software for entertainment, communication, and education. We have had some dramatic successes.

AB  - This experiment examines how, high and low mechanical and spatial abilities, learners understand an animation. Two variables were manipulated: the controllability of the animations and the task type of the learners to study the device. The comprehension test results indicated a positive effect of a fully controllable animation and also a positive effect of task type, when the attention of the learner is focused on the functional model and on local kinematics. The eye tracking data indicated that the learners attend more to the areas of the animations where a great amount of motion is involved along the causal chain of events. We show an effect of the controllability of the system and of the task type of the learner on the amount of eye fixations and on the number of transitions between areas that included the causal chain.

VL  - 120
IS  - 3
AB  - This study explored an approach to boosting a journal’s citation potential by proposing the Referenced Value of a journal (RFVj) as a new measure for evaluating a journal’s performance. Because RFVj can be defined once a journal has been published, it offers advantages regarding the properties of timeliness and certainty over traditional indicators such as journal impact factor (JIF) and the total number of citations of a journal. Additionally, RFVj has merits with both calculation simplicity and data reproducibility. Taking the underlying assumption that a journal’s long-term citations, which is used as a reliable proxy of a journal’s impact, can be obtained through a longer citation time window (CTW), we investigated the correlation between RFVj and a journal’s cumulative citation counts (a journal’s Times Cited, TCj) with a longer CTW. The results indicate that RFVj has a statistically significant correlation with TCj, based on which we argue that by improving its RFVj a journal can improve its TCj, namely a journal can boost its citation potential by improving its RFVj.

AB  - With 50% of people spending over 6 h per day surfing the web, web browsers offer a promising platform for the delivery of behavior change interventions. One technique might be subliminal priming of behavioral concepts (e.g., walking). This paper presents Subly, an open-source plugin for Google’s Chrome browser that primes behavioral concepts through slight emphasis on words and phrases as people browse the Internet. Such priming interventions might be employed across several domains, such as breaking sedentary activity, promoting safe use of the Internet among minors, promoting civil discourse and breaking undesirable online habits such excessive use of social media. We present two studies with Subly: one that identifies the threshold of subliminal perception and one that demonstrates the efficacy of Subly in a picture-selection task. We conclude with opportunities and ethical considerations arising from the future use of Subly to achieve behavior change.

AB  - To investigate the difficulties in communication, socialization abilities, and emotion perception deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we propose the project SARA. Its main goal is to assess how abstracted emotional facial expressions influence the categorization of the emotions by children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD. This paper focuses on the first pilot study where an adapted version of the Dynamic Emotional Categorization Test (DECT) was implemented. The results support the validity of the emotional facial animations, which is confirmed by the low performance of subjects with high-functioning ASD when categorizing emotions, in comparison with their peers without ASD.

AB  - Visual exploration skill acquisition is important for many vocational professions, yet many apprentices struggle to acquire these skills, impacting both their grades and practical work. Traditionally, the learning of visual skills is facilitated through exercises where it can be difficult to identify struggling apprentices early. We propose the use of gaze patterns to identify apprentices who may need additional support. In this paper, we investigated differences in gaze patterns between teachers and apprentices and the relationship between gaze patterns and student performance. In a study with 18 fashion design apprentices and 16 fashion design teacher, we found teachers have a higher gaze coverage of an image than apprentices and there is a correlation between the verbalisation score of apprentices and their similarity of gaze patterns to the teacher average. Using these results, we may be able to adapt exercises to apprentices’ particular needs early in the learning process.

We present an eye-tracking study that attempts to answer these questions for Spanish, using fixation and reading time to measure readability as well as comprehension questions to score understandability. We find that digits are faster to read but do not help comprehension. Fractions help understandability while percentages help readability. No significant results were found concerning the influence of rounding. Our experiments were performed by 72 persons, half of them with dyslexia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the cognitive load of number representation in any language, even more for people with dyslexia.

To investigate the possibility to handle multiple vehicles in a simulated setting was set up where the operator simultaneous managed one, two, or three UGVs with limited autonomy. The task was to navigate the UGVs to designated inspection points as fast as possible. The results showed that more inspections were made with multiple UGVs (p<0.05), but also that that there was no difference between using two or three UGVs (p>0.05). Analysis of use of autonomous mode, route selection, and interviews also show that the subject managed to operate two vehicles with increased performance but that a third vehicle does not provide any extra benefits.

AB  - In an aged society, easy-to-use information devices are necessary. In order to develop information devices which elderly adults can use easily, it is important to bring out characteristics of elderly adults in using information devices based on their cognitive functions. In this study, the authors focus on a relation between memory function and exploration behavior in a hierarchical menu while learning process. An experiment is conducted with eight elderly adults and eight young adults. In this experiment, a hierarchical menu composed based on the library classification, not actual hierarchical menus, is used in order to eliminate differences of knowledge about information devices between elderly and young adults. As a result, it seems that decrease of episodic memory increases a possibility of improper selections in the hierarchical menu when doing the same operations as previous operations.

AB  - Poor operator direct sight can lead to collisions between excavators and humans, especially during reversing movements. Viewing aids, such as mirrors and camera monitor systems (CMS) are intended to compensate this. As empirical evidence on operators’ visual information acquisition is scarce, this study investigated utilization of mirrors and CMS during regular work on construction sites by using eye-tracking and task observation. Results show that, during reversing movements, especially the left mirror and the CMS monitor were used. Implications of utilization and neglect are discussed with regard to safety and machinery design, such as configuration of viewing aids.

VL  - 23
IS  - 3
AB  - Given the factors such as safety, profitability, and environmental concerns at stake, operator training is an everlasting and vital process in the process industry. An inevitable need for skilled operators in the chemical industry leads to search for novel and effective training methodologies. Consequently, dynamic simulation techniques have been considered as a tool to educate and train inexperienced personnel as expected by the industry. Traditional training methodologies are hardly sufficient to instruct the operators for seldom-occurring perilous situations. Conventional operator training simulators (OTS) are generally effective, but they lack to give operators the actual feel of the scenarios. Training effectiveness can be enhanced by providing operators with a sense of realism. Therefore, integration of OTS with virtual reality (VR-OTS) certainly comes out to be an alternative. VR-OTS can replicate emergency conditions, accidents, and investigate safety protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for virtual reality (VR) in OTS, merits of VR-OTS, and the role of training assessment methods. Contributions of OTS Authors’ in process industry from year 2000 to mid-2017 are reviewed and discussed extensively. The review shows that VR-OTS provides tangible benefits over its conventional counterparts in terms of improved safety of plant, increased productivity, and environmental protection. Finally, this paper outlines future scopes that the current researcher may consider to focus for the increased and improved VR-OTS usage.

AB  - Field operators need access to and interaction with more information than is available today during field operations. Wearable computers can provide relevant information with hands-free interaction techniques to support work tasks in the field. Potential implications of introducing wearable computers are collaboration, information overload, situation awareness and social relationships. Interaction techniques between humans are natural and well known and include voice, gestures, eye movements and biopotentials. Voice is a promising interaction technique for wearable computers, assuming improvements for rough and noisy environments. Wearable computers may change the roles and responsibilities while providing extended support for communication and collaboration. Field operators will be better prepared to prevent failures and secure quality. Control room operators will perform more administrative and management tasks.

AB  - Information quantity is an important factor in decision making, but the relationship between them in digital interface is still unclear. This paper presents a study on the range of information quantity that is most suitable for decision making in digital interface of complex information systems. Interface image stimuli of nuclear power plant with linear change in image entropy are presented to subjects in a decision-making task. Subjects are required to make proper decision by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard when an abnormal value appears. Results show that interfaces with image entropy between 0.4 and 0.6 have higher decision efficiency than other ranges. The decision load increases as the quantity of information increases. And different genders show differences, females prefer lower information quantity (0.4 to 0.6) and males prefer higher information quantity (0.4 to 1.2). These findings can be used to quickly control the quality of interfaces at the early stage of design and evaluate interfaces in an efficient way.

AB  - Deaf people have certain problems navigating on the Internet. This is a subject, which has not received adequate scientific attention. Via an experiment with both deaf and hearing people, text was identified as a problem for deaf people when navigating on websites. A prototype of a website with an embedded sign language dictionary, which translates keywords to sign language, was developed and tested against the same website without the dictionary. This test revealed that deaf people who were given the sign language prototype completed a given task significantly faster than deaf people who were given the website without the dictionary. A final test showed that deaf and hearing people use the same number of metacognitive comprehension strategies when reading on websites, but the frequency of their usage was different. Deaf people make more use of a search and match strategy, which is a behavior this prototype supports.

AB  - In the first chapter of this book, I argued that if we want to understand how “computing has changed the world,” a more user-centered historiography of computing is needed. For this purpose, we need sources of those who used digital technology and how they used it. In the following chapter, I described and analyzed how we conducted a large-scale documentation project, which aimed to collect and create sources of the use of computers in Swedish society between 1950 and 1980. In this concluding chapter, I concentrate on a discussion of how the collection of oral history interviews and witness seminars, that form the core of our documentation efforts, can contribute to the Swedish historiography of computing. However, my intention is not to make a thorough analysis of this rich and comprehensive material. That formidable task I happily leave to other scholars and researchers. Here, my aim is rather to suggest how the collection can be used for addressing recent historiographical issues. I present three cases, using diverse examples from our collection, which each illustrates how oral evidence can inform us about the interaction of computing with large-scale transformations in economies, cultures, and societies. The first case deals with career patterns, social networks, and flows of knowledge, the second with users and uses of technology, and the third with the materiality and geography of computing. However, I will start out with a critical discussion on the interpretation of oral evidence.

Making use of the eye of the computer, a webcam, we can acquire human reaction data through the acquisition of facial images in response to stimuli. The data of interest in this research are changes in pupil size and gaze patterns in conjunction with classification of facial expression. Although fusion of these measurements has been considered in the past by Xiang and Kankanhalli [14] as well as Valverde et al. [15], their approach was quite different from ours. Both groups used a multimodal set-up: an eye tracker alongside a webcam and the stimulus was visual. A novel approach is to avoid costly eye trackers and rely on images acquired only from a standard webcam to measure changes in pupil size, gaze patterns and facial expression in response to auditory stimuli. The auditory mode is often preferred since luminance does not need to be accounted for, unlike visual stimulation from a monitor. The fusion of the information from these features is then used to distinguish between negative, neutral and positive emotional states. In this paper we discuss an experiment (n = 15) where the stimuli from the auditory version of the international affective picture system (IAPS) are used to elicit these three main emotions in participants. Webcam data is recorded during the experiments and advanced signal processing and feature extraction techniques are used on the resulting image files to achieve a model capable of predicting neutral, positive, and negative emotional states.

AB  - Visual saliency computation is about detecting and understanding pertinent regions and elements in a visual scene. Given limited computational resources, the human visual system relies on saliency computation to quickly grasp important information from the excessive input from the visual world. Modeling visual saliency computation can help computer vision systems to filter out irrelevant information and thus make them fast and smart.

SP  - 1385
EP  - 1397
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
AB  - Computer analysis of visual art, especially paintings, is an interesting cross-disciplinary research domain. Most of the research in the analysis of paintings involve medium to small range datasets with own specific settings. Interestingly, significant progress has been made in the field of object and scene recognition lately. A key factor in this success is the introduction and availability of benchmark datasets for evaluation. Surprisingly, such a benchmark setup is still missing in the area of computational painting categorization. In this work, we propose a novel large scale dataset of digital paintings. The dataset consists of paintings from 91 different painters. We further show three applications of our dataset namely: artist categorization, style classification and saliency detection. We investigate how local and global features popular in image classification perform for the tasks of artist and style categorization. For both categorization tasks, our experimental results suggest that combining multiple features significantly improves the final performance. We show that state-of-the-art computer vision methods can correctly classify 50 % of unseen paintings to its painter in a large dataset and correctly attribute its artistic style in over 60 % of the cases. Additionally, we explore the task of saliency detection on paintings and show experimental findings using state-of-the-art saliency estimation algorithms.

AB  - Stroke patients must exercise intensely with rehabilitation robots to achieve satisfactory rehabilitation outcome, but ensuring appropriate exercise difficulty is a challenging task. Brain-computer interfaces would be suitable for such difficulty adaptations since they capture both conscious and subconscious aspects of workload, but have seen little use in rehabilitation. This chapter reviews previous work on passive brain–computer interfaces and highlights the practical challenges of applying the technology to motor rehabilitation. Preliminary results of a study on workload estimation in a rehabilitation robot with healthy subjects are then presented. Adaptive stepwise regression is used to estimate different types of workload from electroencephalography signals recorded at different sites. Results show that electroencephalography can achieve more accurate workload estimation than autonomic nervous system responses and that adaptive estimation methods can further improve accuracy. However, the number of electrode sites needs to be reduced and issues such as motion artefacts must be resolved before passive brain-computer interfaces can be used in motor rehabilitation.

AB  - We introduce PathGAN, a deep neural network for visual scanpath prediction trained on adversarial examples. A visual scanpath is defined as the sequence of fixation points over an image defined by a human observer with its gaze. PathGAN is composed of two parts, the generator and the discriminator. Both parts extract features from images using off-the-shelf networks, and train recurrent layers to generate or discriminate scanpaths accordingly. In scanpath prediction, the stochastic nature of the data makes it very difficult to generate realistic predictions using supervised learning strategies, but we adopt adversarial training as a suitable alternative. Our experiments prove how PathGAN improves the state of the art of visual scanpath prediction on the iSUN and Salient360! datasets.

AB  - In this paper, a general process of design and evaluation of serious games is presented. There are, obviously, qualitative and quantitative ways to analyze game dynamics (understood as mechanics activated by the user). Their general principles have been taken into consideration and a proposal of a modified pattern-based framework that allows for inclusion of data acquired from eye-tracker and biosensors used in affective computing. The paper concludes with a case study of design patterns in serious game that is currently in use as part of OHD training at the authors’ Alma Mater.

EP  - 191
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Data visualizations are used to communicate information to people in a wide variety of contexts, but few tools are available to help visualization designers evaluate the effectiveness of their designs. Visual saliency maps that predict which regions of an image are likely to draw the viewer’s attention could be a useful evaluation tool, but existing models of visual saliency often make poor predictions for abstract data visualizations. These models do not take into account the importance of features like text in visualizations, which may lead to inaccurate saliency maps. In this paper we use data from two eye tracking experiments to investigate attention to text in data visualizations. The data sets were collected under two different task conditions: a memory task and a free viewing task. Across both tasks, the text elements in the visualizations consistently drew attention, especially during early stages of viewing. These findings highlight the need to incorporate additional features into saliency models that will be applied to visualizations.

We suggest altered patterns applicable in interrogative settings, and validate them using testimony to a Canadian commission. Predictive accuracy rates above 80% are achieved. Difficulties remain, however, because other work suggests that emotional intensity also impacts the patterns associated with deception, so these results may not extend to criminal trials.

AB  - Scientists from many different disciplines (including physiology, psychology, and engineering) have worked on modelling visual perception. However this field has been less extensively studied in the context of computer science, as most existing perception models work only for very specific domains such as menu searching or icon searching tasks. We are developing a perception model that works for any application. It takes a list of mouse events, a sequence of bitmap images of an interface and locations of different objects in the interface as input, and produces a sequence of eye-movements as output. We have identified a set of features to differentiate among different screen objects and using those features, our model has reproduced the results of previous experiments on visual perception in the context of HCI. It can also simulate the effects of different visual impairments on interaction. In this paper we discuss the design, implementation and two pilot studies to demonstrate the model.

AB  - Cognitive capabilities such as perception, reasoning, learning, and planning turn technical systems into systems that “know what they are doing.” Starting from the human brain the Cluster of Excellence “CoTeSys” investigates cognition for technical systems such as vehicles, robots, and factories. Technical systems that are cognitive will be much easier to interact and cooperate with, and will be more robust, flexible, and efficient. For understanding their environment and interacting with humans the cognitive system’s most important sense is the visual one. The talk presents recent results using the visual sensor in building environment models, self localization of autonomous moving robots, navigation, simultaneous tracking of groups of humans and robots, face detection and evaluation of gaze direction and facial expression, and emotional communication between humans and robots.

AB  - Symmetry is an important factor in human perception in general, as well as in the visualization of graphs in particular. There are three main types of symmetry: reflective, translational, and rotational. We report the results of a human subjects experiment to determine what types of symmetries are more salient in drawings of graphs. We found statistically significant evidence that vertical reflective symmetry is the most dominant (when selecting among vertical reflective, horizontal reflective, and translational). We also found statistically significant evidence that rotational symmetry is affected by the number of radial axes (the more, the better), with a notable exception at four axes.

AB  - In current robotic surgery, dexterity is enhanced by microprocessor controlled mechanical wrists which allow motion scaling for reduced gross hand movements and improved performance of micro-scale tasks. The continuing evolution of the technology, including force feedback and virtual immobilization through real-time motion adaptation, will permit complex procedures such as beating heart surgery to be carried out under a static frame-of-reference. In pursuing more adaptive and intelligent robotic designs, the regulatory, ethical and legal barriers imposed on interventional surgical robots have given rise to the need of a tightly integrated control between the operator and the robot when autonomy is considered. This paper outlines the general concept of perceptual docking for robotic control and how it can be used for learning and knowledge acquisition in robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery such that operator specific motor and perceptual/cognitive behaviour is acquired through in situ sensing. A gaze contingent framework is presented in this paper as an example to illustrate how saccadic eye movements and ocular vergence can be used for attention selection, recovering 3D tissue deformation and motor channelling during minimally invasive surgical procedures.

AB  - To date, research on the processing involved in comprehending and learning from animated diagrams has accorded a minor role only to perceptual operations in general and peripheral processing in particular. For those aspects where the role of perception is acknowledged, it is foveal rather than peripheral processing that is regarded as the main player. In this paper, we use the results from additional finer grained analysis of data collected in a recent empirical study to suggest that information from a viewer’s peripheral field can play a much more central role in animation processing than has previously been recognized. It appears that if the dynamic information comprising an animated diagram is presented in a suitable way, the resources available for visual perception can be partitioned so that responsibility is shared efficiently between foveal and peripheral processing. Implications with regard to elaboration of the Animation Processing Model and possible interventions for improving animation processing are discussed.

AB  - This paper demonstrates significant improvement in the performance of a computer vision system by incorporating the results of an experiment on human visual perception. This system was designed to solve a problem existing in the cork industry: the automatic classification of cork samples according to their quality. This is a difficult problem because cork is a natural and heterogeneous material. An eye-tracker was used to analyze the gaze patterns of a human expert trained in cork classification, and the results identified visual features of cork samples used by the expert in making decisions. Variations in lightness of the cork surface proved to be a key feature, and this finding was used to select the features included in the final system: defects in the sample (thresholding), size of the biggest defect (morphological operations), and four Laws textural features, all working on a Neuro-Fuzzy classifier. The results obtained from the final system show lower error rates than previous systems designed for this application.

AB  - Unmanned construction machines are used after disasters. Compared with manned construction, time efficiency is lower because of incomplete visual information, communication delay, and lack of tactile experience. We have developed an autonomous camera control system to supply appropriate visual information. In order to let operator easy to avoid unexpected collision, we first introduce the frame for each viewport according to its contents. And then, we exchange the danger view with an overlook view. The purpose of this study is to attract operators’ attention to the danger area when there is a probable collision if operator won’t stop or change their action. Besides, we also want to reveal the relationship between gaze habit and performance. The experimental results conducted using our virtual reality simulator confirms that operator tends to watch danger view when it appears. In addition, work strategy may influence the danger avoidance and work time efficiency in opposite way.

AB  - Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is a common process carried out by groups in a wide variety of situations and contexts. From family activities to business tasks, people typically engage in collaborative search practices while working toward a common goal. In collaborative settings, various aspects of human behavior influence the way people interact with each other and make decisions. One of these aspects corresponds to emotions and related affective processes such as mood and feelings. Studies in social psychology have suggested that group dynamics and their performance may be affected by the interaction of affective processes, in particular positive and negative ones. Although such findings have been derived in different group situations, to the best of our knowledge none of them refer to the particular case of CIS. Based on previous studies, we investigate to what extent positive and negative affective states relate to group performance in CIS. To carry out this study, we designed an experiment with 45 dyads distributed in three configurations based on initial affective states: (1) positive-positive, (2) positive-negative, and (3) negative-negative. To achieve these initial conditions, members of each dyad were individually exposed to affective stimuli. Following, each dyad worked on a precision-oriented search task. Our results suggest that the three interactions of affective states have different implications on the performance of dyads. In particular, the negative-negative configuration performed significantly better than the other two configurations. Conversely, performance of the positive-negative condition was found to be significantly lower than the other two conditions. Findings from this work have practical implications for applications such as team design in tasks involving CIS.

AB  - Eye tracking is considered one of the most salient methods to study the cognitive demands of humans in human computer interactive systems, due to the unobtrusiveness, flexibility and the development of inexpensive eye trackers. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of these low cost eyetrackers to study pupillary response to varying memory loads and luminance conditions. Specifically, we examine a low-cost eye tracker, the Gazepoint GP3, and objectively evaluate its ability to differentiate pupil dilation metrics under different cognitive loads and luminance conditions. The classification performance is computed in the form of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the results indicate that Gazepoint provides a reliable eye tracker to human computer interaction applications requiring pupil dilation studies.

AB  - The paper describes a system aimed at improving the human machine interaction that is able to identify users according how she looks at the monitor. The proposed system does not need invasive measurements that could limit the naturalness of her actions. The approach, here described, detects the gaze movements on the monitor and clusters the sequences of user gaze fixation points on the screen characterizing the user according the particular patterns her gaze follows. The recognition of the user is performed through a clustering process employing the Mean-Shift algorithm and it can open new perspective in human-machine interaction. In particular, the parameters of the clustering process are tuned optimizing an entropy oriented cost function that allows an automatic selection of the best parameters setting.

AB  - Thanks to the spread of digital photography and available devices, taking photographs has become effortless and tolerated nearly everywhere. This makes people easily ending up with hundreds or thousands of photos, for example, when returning from a holiday trip or taking part in ceremonies, concerts, and other events. Furthermore, photos are also taken of more mundane motives, such as food and aspects of everyday life, further increasing the number of photos to be dealt with. The decreased prices of storage devices make dumping the whole set of photos common and affordable. However, this practice frequently makes the stored collections a kind of dark archives, which are rarely accessed and enjoyed again in the future. The big size of the collections makes revisiting them time demanding. This suggests to identify, with the support of automated methods, the sets of most important photos within the whole collections and to invest some preservation effort for keeping them accessible over time. Evaluating the importance of photos to their owners is a complex process, which is often driven by personal attachment, memories behind the content, and personal tastes that are difficult to capture automatically. Therefore, to better understand the selection process for photo preservation and future revisiting, the first part of this chapter presents a user study on a photo selection task where participants selected subsets of most important pictures from their own collections. In the second part of this chapter, we present methods to automatically select important photos from personal collections, in light of the insights emerged from the user study. We model a notion of photo importance driven by user expectations, which represents what photos users perceive as important and would have selected. We present an expectation-oriented method for photo selection, where information at both photo and collection levels is considered to predict the importance of photos.

AB  - Understanding human gaze behaviour in social context, as along a face-to-face interaction, remains an open research issue which is strictly related to personality traits. In the effort to bridge the gap between available data and models, typical approaches focus on the analysis of spatial and temporal preferences of gaze deployment over specific regions of the observed face, while adopting classic statistical methods. In this note we propose a different analysis perspective based on novel data-mining techniques and a probabilistic classification method that relies on Gaussian Processes exploiting Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) kernel. Preliminary results obtained on a publicly available dataset are provided.

AB  - The assessment of individual personality traits plays a crucial role in important social events such as interpersonal relationships, job search, crime fighters, and disease treatment. In this paper, a multi-view (frontal and profile view, 2.5D) facial feature extraction model is proposed to evaluate the possible correlation between personality traits and face images. Our main contribution and innovation are threefold: Our primary contribution is the development of a 2.5D hybrid personality computational model in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of one’s personality traits; the second is that we have established two datasets. Datasets of people over 35 years of age are compared with those of 16–35-year-olds. We focus on the relationship between personality traits in human face and age; Finally, on a dataset of 500 facial images pre-processed from our face database and an personality score dataset collected from human testers, we evaluate the model through the application of support vector regression (SVR). Result shows that the prediction performance of the 2.5D feature model is better than that of the 2D model. We show that the 2.5D model performs well with low statistic error (MSE = 0.4991) and good predictability (R2 = 0.5638).

AB  - Although personality dimensions figure prominently in what people prefer or like about a display, little is known about precisely how personality dimensions can be predicted through our visual preferences. We investigated the feasibility for predicting continuous dimensions of personality traits (Big Five dimensions) from preferences captured by users’ eye movements while scanning the preferred regions in a visual presentation. The eye-movement behavior of 96 participants was examined to identify their preferences in five visual design presentations. A multi-target learning method was used to build the prediction model of continuous dimensions of personality based on fixation and saccadic eye parameters. The results showed that participants’ preferences for certain visual elements tended to explain their personality profile. Our findings offer new insights for personality assessment, human–computer interaction, personalization, and rational choice theories. It also addresses new trends related to the regulation of eye movements toward regions of interest based on the proportion of personality dimensions.

AB  - This research focuses on developing a data-driven framework for modeling and scaffolding learners’ self-regulated learning (SRL) processes in open-ended learning environments (OELE). The aim of this work is to offer a personalized and productive learning experience by adapting scaffolds to help learners develop self-regulation skills and strategies. This research applies mining techniques on data collected from multiple channels to track learners’ cognitive, affective, metacognitive and motivational (CAMM) processes as they work in Betty’s Brain, a computer-based OELE. The CAMM information is used to derive online models of learners’ SRL processes. These learner models inform the design of personalized scaffolds that help students develop the required SRL process and become more proficient learners. The significance of this research lies in developing and using data-driven learner SRL models to personalize and contextualize the scaffolds provided to learners within the OELE.

AB  - It is difficult to adjust the content of traditional slide presentations to the knowledge level, interest and role of individuals. This might force presenters to include content that is irrelevant for part of the audience, which negatively affects the knowledge transfer of the presentation. In this work, we present a prototype that is able to eliminate non-pertinent information from slides by presenting annotations for individual attendees on optical head-mounted displays. We first create guidelines for creating optimal annotations for HMDs by evaluating several types of annotations alongside different types of slides. Then we evaluate the knowledge acquisition of presentation attendees using the prototype versus traditional presentations. Our results show that annotations with a limited amount of information, such as text up to 5 words, can significantly increase the amount of knowledge gained from attending a group presentation. Additionally, presentations where part of the information is moved to annotations are judged more positively on attributes such as clarity and enjoyment.

AB  - In everyday life discussion, people try to persuade each other about the goodness of their viewpoint regarding a certain topic. This persuasion process is usually affected by several elements, like the ability of the speaker in formulating logical arguments, her confidence with respect to the discussed topic, and the emotional solicitation that certain arguments may cause in the audience. In this study, we compare the effect of using one of the three well-known persuasion strategies (Logos, Ethos and Pathos) in the argumentation process. These strategies are used by a moderator who influences the participants during the debates. We study which persuasion strategy is the most effective, and how they vary according to two mental metrics extracted from electroencephalograms: Engagement and workload. Results show that the right hemisphere has the highest engagement when Logos arguments are proposed to participants with Neutral opinion during the debate. We show also that the Logos strategy solicits the highest mental Workload, and the Pathos strategy is the most effective to use in argumentation and to convince the participants.

AB  - This paper proposes a pervasive retail architecture based on a free human gaze estimation system. The main aim of the paper is to investigate the possibility to automatically understand the behavior of the persons looking at a shop window: this is done by a gaze estimation technique that uses a RGB-D device in order to extract head pose information from which a fast geometric technique then evaluates the focus of attention of the persons in the scene (even more persons at the same time). The main contribution concerns with the application into this challenging research field of a gaze estimation working without any initial calibration and, in spite of this, able to properly deal with completely unaware persons moving in unconstrained environments. Preliminary experiments were conducted in our lab in order to quantitative validate the accuracy of the gaze estimation on different benchmarks of persons. Then the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture was conducted in a real shop window demonstrating the ability to deal with real challenging environmental conditions.

TI  - Physical discomfort and eye movements during arbitrary and optical flow-like motions in stereo 3D contents
JO  - Virtual Reality
AB  - Users of stereo 3D technology commonly report physical discomfort during or after exposure of stereo 3D contents. The discomfort has been associated with sensation of arbitrary and optical flow-like self-motion. However, there is no information on whether arbitrary motion induces stronger physical discomfort compared with optical flow-like motion. To address this research gap, we investigate physical discomfort among players and spectators of stereo 3D contents using eye tracking and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Thirty participants ($$N=30$$N=30) acted as players and spectators of a first-person shooter (FPS) and a car racing game. The FPS and the car racing game produce a sensation of arbitrary and optical flow-like self-motion, respectively. Experimental results show that the FPS game induces more severe physical discomfort than its racing counterpart ($$p<0.0083$$p<0.0083, with a Bonferroni correction to the p value). We also found that severeness of oculomotor symptoms can be predicted using two eye movements metrics: the amount of fixational eye movements and viewing duration at the center of the screen. Our study implies that one should pay particular attention to different types of self-motion in stereo 3D contents regardless of whether the user controls or solely watches the contents. Our study also suggests that physical discomfort can be reduced by decreasing the frequency of fixational eye movements while prolonging the duration of each fixation at the center of screen.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between emotion and physiological measures of autonomic system response. Features of electrodermal, cardiac, respiratory, movement, and oculomotor response were measured from a population of normal subjects while they were presented standard acoustic and visual stimuli designed to evoke specific emotions. The subjects’ assessments of their emotional response to the stimuli (self-report) were also recorded. We present results of a preliminary analysis of the statistical relationship between the stimulus category, the physiological features and self-report. We found significant differences across stimulus categories, as well as across self-reported emotions, suggesting that a combination of features could be used to classify the emotional content of a discrete stimulus. We also examine the dependence of physiological signals on the mode of stimulus presentations.

The use of multiple signals or physiological measures as a whole has been carried out using data fusion techniques commonly known as multimodal fusion, which has demonstrated its ability to improve the accuracy of diagnostic care systems. This paper presents a review of state of the art, putting in relief the main techniques, challenges, gaps, advantages, disadvantages, and practical considerations of data fusion applied to the analysis of physiological signals oriented to diagnosis decision support. Also, physiological signals data fusion architecture oriented to diagnosis is proposed.

AB  - Practitioners in many fields of human-computer interaction are now using physiological data to measure different aspects of user experience. The dynamic nature of physiological data offers a continuous window to the users and allows a better understanding of their experience while interacting with a system. However, in order to be truly informative, physiological signals need to be closely linked to users’ behaviors and interaction states. This paper presents an analysis method that provides a direct visual interpretation of users’ physiological signals when interacting with an interface. The proposed physiological heatmap tool uses eyetracking data along with physiological signals to identify regions where users are experiencing different emotional and cognitive states with a higher frequency. The method was evaluated in an experiment with 44 participants. Results show that physiological heatmaps are able to identify emotionally significant regions within an interface better than standard gaze heatmaps. Applications of the method to different fields of HCI research are also discussed.

AB  - Human motion analysis in images and video, with its deeply inter-related 2D and 3D inference components, is a central computer vision problem. Yet, there are no studies that reveal how humans perceive other people in images and how accurate they are. In this paper we aim to unveil some of the processing—as well as the levels of accuracy—involved in the 3D perception of people from images by assessing the human performance. Moreover, we reveal the quantitative and qualitative differences between human and computer performance when presented with the same visual stimuli and show that metrics incorporating human perception can produce more meaningful results when integrated into automatic pose prediction algorithms. Our contributions are: (1) the construction of an experimental apparatus that relates perception and measurement, in particular the visual and kinematic performance with respect to 3D ground truth when the human subject is presented an image of a person in a given pose; (2) the creation of a dataset containing images, articulated 2D and 3D pose ground truth, as well as synchronized eye movement recordings of human subjects, shown a variety of human body configurations, both easy and difficult, as well as their ‘re-enacted’ 3D poses; (3) quantitative analysis revealing the human performance in 3D pose re-enactment tasks, the degree of stability in the visual fixation patterns of human subjects, and the way it correlates with different poses; (4) extensive analysis on the differences between human re-enactments and poses produced by an automatic system when presented with the same visual stimuli; (5) an approach to learning perceptual metrics that, when integrated into visual sensing systems, produces more stable and meaningful results.

CY  - Cham
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the differences of eye movements among three different flight backgrounds. There were eleven participants (2 military pilots with average 2,250 flying hours, 6 commercial pilots with average 5,360 flying hours, and 3 novices). All participants wear a mobile eye tracker during the experiment operating a Boeing 747 flight simulator for landing. The eye tracker recorded all participants’ eye movement data automatically. The average values of the latency of first fixation (LFF) and the total contact time (TCT) for five regions of interest (ROIs) are used to examine proposed hypotheses. The findings include: (1) participants of different flight backgrounds have different sequences of viewing ROIs; (2) participants of military pilots and novices spent most of time viewing the outside of cockpit (ROI-3); however, participants of commercial pilots spent most of time viewing the Primary Flight Display (ROI-1). Current research findings might be applied for developing conversion training for military pilots conversed to civil airlines pilots. The fundamental reasons of why pilots viewing ROIs in different sequence and spending significant different time on the ROIs needed to be studied further in the future.

VL  - 18
IS  - 3
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze pilots’ visual scanning under conditions visually restricted by the occlusion paradigm. During manual flight, pilots experienced interruptions in their panel scan due to concurring tasks and monitoring of distant displays. Eleven volunteer airline pilots performed several manual instrument landing system approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Some of these approaches were performed using the paradigm of occlusion with shutter glasses. Under occlusion, the gaze pattern analysis revealed that pilots demonstrated reduced mean glance durations, but did not reduce their attention to lesser information displays. The results also indicated that the attitude indicator (artificial horizon) as a preview instrument was less affected by occlusion compared to other areas of interest. A subsequent scanpath analysis revealed that vertical tracking was the predominant information acquisition strategy and corresponded to larger deviations on the glideslope. These results imply the need to optimize information even for short glances, and to be very cautious with adaptive layouts of free programmable or dynamic displays, and not to overburden the pilot flying with parallel tasks.

AB  - The civil construction industry in Australia is under pressure to attract, train and retain high numbers of skilled personnel. At the same time it is recognized as one of the most dangerous industries in the country. To counteract the safety issues and the labor shortages, plant operator training augmented by simulation is being investigated as an alternative to current training methods. Construction worksites using heavy excavation and earthmoving equipment are at risk of a multitude of potentially dangerous situations. A review of the literature on simulation reveals high benefits across other areas of industry using heavy, human-operated machinery such as rail and mining. This paper presents an initial preliminary case study to investigate the benefits and drawbacks experienced in the use of simulation in a current construction training program prior to the commencement of a rigorous larger-scale study being undertaken to investigate the human factors benefits of simulator training in construction. While building and construction’s use of simulation is in its infancy, a major training provider in Australia has introduced simulation as a key feature in their training programs to attract new entrants into construction careers, enhance safety and introduce the benefits of technology to a traditional area of training. Finally, the paper discusses the research approach that will be used to assess the larger study of simulation use in construction to train heavy plant operation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - A new method is proposed for utilising scene information for stereo eye tracking in stereoscopic 3D virtual environments. The approach aims to improve gaze tracking accuracy and reduce the required user engagement with eye tracking calibration procedures. The approach derives absolute Point of Regard (POR) from the angular velocity of the eyes without user engaged calibration of drift. The method involves reduction of a hypothesis set for the 3D POR via a process of transformation during saccades and intersection with scene geometry during fixations. A basic implementation of this concept has been demonstrated in simulation using the depth buffer of the scene and a particle representation for the hypothesis set. Future research directions will focus on optimisation of the algorithm and improved utilisation of scene information. The technique shows promise in improving gaze tracking techniques in general, including relative paradigms such as electrooculography.

Fixation bias on the target object that the interlocutor was referring to by using her eye gaze showed that the adolescents with ASD followed the gaze of android more than human’s although the sample size was still small.

AB  - This paper presents data loss figures from three experiments, varying in length and visual complexity, in which low-cost eye tracking data were collected. Analysis of data from the first two experiments revealed higher levels of data loss in the visually complex task environment and that task duration did not appear to impact data loss. Results from the third experiment demonstrate how data loss can be mitigated by including periodic eye tracking data quality assessments, which are described in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of overall findings and provides suggestions for researchers interested in employing low-cost eye tracking in human subject experiments.

AB  - Eye tracking is a productive tool in researching the user experience of ecommerce websites. Because information throughout the online path to purchase is communicated visually, gaze behavior is among the most effective and informative means of testing the extent to which a given ecommerce site facilitates a smooth transaction. The process of analysis typically involves examining the characteristics and patterns of visual attention during the online shopping process. Eye-tracking metrics are used in conjunction with data-based visualizations and traditional usability techniques to answer a variety of questions about the online shopping process. Principles of appropriate design, execution and analysis of an ecommerce eye-tracking study are discussed, along with relevant case examples.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the usefulness of eye tracking data for predicting emotions relevant to learning, specifically boredom and curiosity. The data was collected during a study with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) designed to promote the use of self-regulated learning strategies. We used a variety of machine learning and feature selection techniques to predict students’ self-reported emotions from gaze data features. We examined the optimal amount of interaction time needed to make predictions, as well as which features are most predictive of each emotion. The findings provide insight into how to detect when students disengage from MetaTutor.

AB  - In the previous two chapters, we demonstrated how cognitive effort in text annotation can be assessed by utilizing cognitive information obtained from readers’/annotators’ eye-gaze patterns. While our models are, to some extent, effective in modeling various forms of complexities at the textual side, we observed that cognitive information can also be useful to model the ability of a reader to understand/comprehend the given reading material. This observation was quite clear in our sentiment annotation experiment (discussed in Chap. 3), where the eye-movement patterns of some of our annotators appeared to be subtle when the text had linguistic nuances like sarcasm, which the annotators failed to recognize. This motivated us to work on a highly specific yet important problem of sarcasm understandability prediction—a starting step toward an even more important problem of modeling text comprehensibility.

AB  - Confident usage of information visualizations is thought to be influenced by cognitive aspects as well as amount of exposure and training. To support the development of individual competency in visualization processing, it is important to ascertain if we can track users’ progress or difficulties they might have while working with a given visualization. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting in real time a user’s learning curve—a mathematical model that can represent a user’s skill acquisition ability—when working with a visualization. First, we investigate whether results we previously obtained in predicting users’ learning curves during visualization processing generalize to a different visualization. Second, we study to what extent we can make predictions on a user’s learning curve without information on the visualization being used. Our models leverage various data sources, including a user’s gaze behavior, pupil dilation, and cognitive abilities. We show that these models outperform a baseline that leverages knowledge on user task performance so far. Our best performing model achieves good accuracies in predicting users’ learning curves even after observing users’ performance on a few tasks only. These results represent an important step toward understanding how to support users in learning a new visualization.

VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - Contextual understanding, which consists of memory, reasoning, and recall, is a key process of human–computer interactions and interfaces which provide universal accessibility. To determine the possibility of predicting the recall accuracy of reading and memorizing tasks using features of oculo-motors, eye movements, and pupillary changes, a contextual understanding task experiment, which was composed of definition and question statements, was conducted. The existence of a relationship between the features of oculo-motors during memorization and recall performance was hypothesized. The features of viewer’s oculo-motors while reading and judging a statement were observed, and significant differences were identified in most features according to the correctness of responses. The possibility of predicting the verification accuracy of question statements using these features for definition statements and the support vector regression technique was established, and there was a significant correlational relationship between the predicted accuracy and the experimental accuracy. Also, the estimation performance for judging question statements was assessed using the features and support vector machines. Estimation accuracy was the highest when all extracted features of eye movements were used. The number of definition statements, which were experimental conditions used to control the task difficulty, affected the accuracy of both prediction and estimation. These results provide evidence that features of oculo-motors during the reading, memorizing, and recalling of statements can be used as an index of contextual understanding.

AB  - Studies of visual attention of patients with Dementia such as Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and Alzheimer Disease is a promising way for non-invasive diagnostics. Past research showed, that people suffering from dementia are not reactive with regard to degradations on still images. Attempts are being made to study their visual attention relatively to the video content. Here the delays in their reactions on novelty and “unusual” novelty of the visual scene are expected. Nevertheless, large-scale screening of population is possible only if sufficiently robust automatic prediction models can be built. In the medical protocols the detection of Dementia behavior in visual content observation is always performed in comparison with healthy, “normal control” subjects. Hence, it is a research question per see as to develop an automatic prediction models for specific visual content to use in psycho-visual experience involving Patients with Dementia (PwD). The difficulty of such a prediction resides in a very small amount of training data. In this paper the reaction of healthy normal control subjects on degraded areas in videos was studied. Furthermore, in order to build an automatic prediction model for salient areas in intentionally degraded videos for PwD studies, a deep learning architecture was designed. Optimal transfer learning strategy for training the model in case of very small amount of training data was deployed. The comparison with gaze fixation maps and classical visual attention prediction models was performed. Results are interesting regarding the reaction of normal control subjects against degraded areas in videos.

In this paper, an algorithm is presented that identifies the appropriate times to interrupt the user is proposed and visualizations of the user’s state. The Intelligent Interruption Algorithm draws from user, task, and environmental contextual information dynamically extracted from the environment as the user performs computer based tasks. The visualizations are a representation of these complex components presented in a way that is meaningful for analysis purposes and for the user. This paper presents the following: the interruption algorithm; the machine learning algorithms used; and the preliminary results of visualizing the interruptible moment.

AB  - There are various techniques to determine the usability of a design such as product label. One of them is the employment of eye movement measurement technique which takes into account a more natural setting and actual user involvement. While previous studies have explained the definition of eye movement and in the usability of a design, this preliminary research was study the eye movement characteristics through the theory of eye tracking on product label that was choose by student, before the research will be further on expert validation on product label through interview. It combining several aspects in eye movement measurements comprises fixation count, fixation duration, cumulative proportion of respondent fixation count and cumulative proportion of respondents for fixation duration on area of interest (AOI) of product label design. The findings reveal that AOI for text design has the highest cumulative proportion of respondent in fixation count and fixation duration. However, AOI for text design also indicates that there was a lack of attention in eye movement. In conclusion, the characteristics of the design elements for each AOI can be determined by the proportion results of eye movement.

AB  - While the development of consumer-oriented health information technologies (CHITs) has led to increased availability and accessibility of personal health information, consumers may encounter difficulty in comprehending the information, partly due to inappropriate information presentation. This study was conducted to compare four visualization formats of personal health information in consumers’ use and comprehension of the information. A within-subjects design was employed, with visualization format serving as independent variable, and sets of user performance, perception, eye movement and preference measures serving as dependent variables. Twenty-four participants were recruited in this study. The results indicated that there was no significant main effect of visualization format on task completion time and accuracy rate, while visualization format yielded a significant effect on perceived health risk, perceived ease of understanding, perceived usefulness, perceived confidence of comprehension, and satisfaction. Participants’ visual attention, indicated by eye movement measures, was significantly affected by areas of interest, but not by visualization format. Most participants preferred personalized enhanced format. Our study demonstrates that visualization formats could affect how personal health information are comprehended and perceived. The results may help to improve the design of more usable and effective health information presentation.

AB  - Head-up displays present driving-related information close to the road scene. The content is readily accessible, but potentially clutters the driver’s view and occludes important parts. This can lead to distraction and negatively influence driving performance. Superimposing display content only on demand – triggered by the driver whenever needed – might provide a good tradeoff between the accessibility of relevant information and the distraction caused by its display. In this paper we present a driving simulator study that investigated the influence of the self-triggered superimposition on workload, distraction and performance. In particular, we compared a gaze-based and a manually triggered superimposition with the permanent display of information and a baseline (speedometer only). We presented four pieces of information with different relevance and update frequency to the driver. We found an increased workload and distraction for the gaze- and manually triggered HUDs as well as an impact on user experience. Participants preferred to have the HUD displayed permanently and with only little content.

AB  - Social media has become a mainstream activity where people share all kinds of personal and intimate details about their lives. These social networking sites (SNS) allow users to conveniently authenticate to the third-party website by using their SNS credentials, thus eliminating the need of creating and remembering another username and password but at the same time agreeing to share their personal information with the SNS site. Often this is accomplished by presenting the user with a dialog box informing them that they will be sharing information. We were interested in determining if SNS users authenticating to a third-party website with their SNS credentials, were reading the informational message and if changing the message format would impact the choice to continue or cancel. Format type did not alter the participant’s choice to continue. Eye-tracking data suggests that the participants who chose to continue read some of the words in the message.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Presuppositions are vital for language comprehension, but little remains known about how they are processed. Using eye tracking in reading, we investigated two issues based on German wieder (’again’). First, we looked at the time course of presupposition processing by testing for processing costs of unsupported presuppositions. Secondly, we tested whether embedding wieder under negation affected a potential mismatch effect. Presupposition-induced effects showed up immediately after wieder, but only in the unembedded context, suggesting that embedding interferes with the detection of the mismatch. However, judgments in a follow-up rating study indicate that a mismatch is perceived in both the embedded and unembedded conditions when the PSP is not supported by the context. Taken together, these results suggest that detection of the mismatch under embedding is delayed in processing.

TI  - Principles of transparency for autonomous vehicles: first results of an experiment with an augmented reality human–machine interface
JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
AB  - Highly automated driving allows the driver to temporarily delegate the driving task to the autonomous vehicle. The challenge is to define the information that needs to be displayed to the driver in this mode, to let him be able to take over properly. This study investigates the automation transparency to ensure a meta-cooperation between the driver and the automation and the way to convey information to the driver using Augmented Reality according to some transparency principles. Therefore, among 45 participants, we evaluated five human–machine interface (HMI) in which some or all of the following functions were integrated: information acquisition, information analysis, decision-making and action execution. To validate our transparency principles, we assessed Situation Awareness, discomfort feeling, and the participants’ preferences. Even though there is no convergence in the first results, it appears clearly that no transparency in the HMI does not help to understand the environment. Additionally, it appears that “information acquisition” and “action execution” functions are quite necessary. Furthermore, the HMI with the high level of transparency was preferred by the participants. However, more analysis is required to obtain final results.

VL  - 23
IS  - 4
AB  - To support program comprehension, maintenance, and evolution, metamodels are frequently used during program reverse engineering activities to describe and analyze constituents of a program and their relations. Reverse engineering tools often define their own metamodels according to the intended purposes and features. Although each metamodel has its own advantages, its limitations may be addressed by other metamodels. Existing works have evaluated and compared metamodels and tools, but none have considered all the possible characteristics and limitations to provide a comprehensive guideline for classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels. To aid practitioners and researchers in classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels and their corresponding reverse engineering tools according to the intended goals, we establish a conceptual framework with definitions of program metamodels and related concepts. We confirmed that any reverse engineering activity can be clearly described as a pattern based on the framework from the viewpoint of program metamodels. Then the framework is used to provide a comprehensive taxonomy, named Program Metamodel TAxonomy (ProMeTA), which incorporates newly identified characteristics into those stated in previous works, which were identified via a systematic literature review (SLR) on program metamodels, while keeping the orthogonality of the entire taxonomy. Additionally, we validate the taxonomy in terms of its orthogonality and usefulness through the classification of popular metamodels.

AB  - This research examines attention to distracting products unrelated to the shopping goal and its impact on performance when making online decisions. An experiment was conducted with thirty-eight participants in a laboratory setting. The study used a 2 (product similarity: similar vs. non-similar) × 2 (visual proximity: near vs. far) within-subject design. The attention of participants was measured with eye tracking during an online decision task. The results showed a significant effect of distractors’ visual proximity as participants spent more time on products that were near the target stimulus. In addition, the analysis yielded an interaction between product similarity and visual distance on users’ attention. Finally, distractors that were similar to the focal stimulus positively influenced decisions accuracy. These findings contribute to theory by providing quantitative measures of the Gestalt law of proximity. In addition, the user experience has become a cornerstone for the success of firms and the conclusions have HCI design implications about effective product presentations in online shops.

This paper introduces a taxonomy for head-mounted displays that is based on the property of its functionality and the ability of our human eye to perceive peripheral information, instead of being technology-dependent. The aim of this paper is to help designers to understand the perception of the human eye, as well as to discuss the factors one needs to take into consideration when designing visual interfaces for PHMDs. We envision this term to help classifying devices such as Google Glass, which are often misclassified as a Head-Up Display (HUD) following NASA’s definition.

Measures of arousal and valence are discussed first, including galvanic skin response (GSR), pupil dilation, and heart rate. This is followed by a discussion of the measurement of eye movement using eye tracking technologies. Lastly, a summary of the LITE lab research is provided. It is concluded that the measures are promising, based on these initial LITE lab results, though further work is needed to more accurately determine the appropriate constructs and contexts for optimizing the use of these tools.

AB  - Individuals adapt to tasks as they repeatedly practice them resulting in increased overall performance. Historically, time and accuracy are two metrics used to measure these adaptations. Here we show preliminary evidence that changes in pupil dilation may be able to capture within-task learning changes. A group of enlisted Sailors and Marines completed forty-eight trials of a cognitive task while their pupils were recorded with a low-cost eye tracking system. As expected, accuracy increased across trials while reaction times significantly decreased. We found a strong, negative correlation of pupil size across the trials. These data suggest that changes in pupil dilation can be used to measure within-task adaptations.

AB  - Robust and accurate detection of the pupil position is a key building block for head-mounted eye tracking and prerequisite for applications on top, such as gaze-based human–computer interaction or attention analysis. Despite a large body of work, detecting the pupil in images recorded under real-world conditions is challenging given significant variability in the eye appearance (e.g., illumination, reflections, occlusions, etc.), individual differences in eye physiology, as well as other sources of noise, such as contact lenses or make-up. In this paper we review six state-of-the-art pupil detection methods, namely ElSe (Fuhl et al. in Proceedings of the ninth biennial ACM symposium on eye tracking research & applications, ACM. New York, NY, USA, pp 123–130, 2016), ExCuSe (Fuhl et al. in Computer analysis of images and patterns. Springer, New York, pp 39–51, 2015), Pupil Labs (Kassner et al. in Adjunct proceedings of the 2014 ACM international joint conference on pervasive and ubiquitous computing (UbiComp), pp 1151–1160, 2014. doi:10.1145/2638728.2641695), SET (Javadi et al. in Front Neuroeng 8, 2015), Starburst (Li et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition-workshops, 2005. IEEE Computer society conference on CVPR workshops. IEEE, pp 79–79, 2005), and Świrski (Świrski et al. in Proceedings of the symposium on eye tracking research and applications (ETRA). ACM, pp 173–176, 2012. doi:10.1145/2168556.2168585). We compare their performance on a large-scale data set consisting of 225,569 annotated eye images taken from four publicly available data sets. Our experimental results show that the algorithm ElSe (Fuhl et al. 2016) outperforms other pupil detection methods by a large margin, offering thus robust and accurate pupil positions on challenging everyday eye images.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the development of an equipment for measuring pupil size variation. A Pupillometer has been developed in order to detect the pupil’s variation in time in a non-invasive way. The output signal of the equipment expresses the pupil’s features variation in time (area, perimeter, vertical diameter, horizontal diameter). The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is divided into the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components and theoretically they are always competing with each other as a two oscillator model. The aim of this project is to identify these components and their frequency bands. With the present results we show that the signal from the pupil’s variation has two major frequency bands, the first being the 0-1 Hz band (LF - Low Frequency) and the second being 1-2Hz band (HF - High Frequency). From the literature we know that the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) behaves in a lower frequency than the Parasympathetic (PSNS) one. This means that SNS oscillates in the LF band and PSNS oscillates in the HF band.

AB  - The ability to visualize occluded objects or people offers tremendous potential to users of augmented reality (AR). This is especially true in mobile applications for urban environments, in which navigation and other operations are hindered by the urban infrastructure. This “X-ray vision” feature has intrigued and challenged AR system designers for many years, with only modest progress in demonstrating a useful and usable capability. The most obvious challenge is to the human visual system, which is being asked to interpret a very unnatural perceptual metaphor. We review the perceptual background to understand how the visual system infers depth and how these assumptions are or are not met by augmented reality displays. In response to these challenges, several visualization metaphors have been proposed; we survey these in light of the perceptual background. Because augmented reality systems are user-centered, it is important to evaluate how well these visualization metaphors enable users to perform tasks that benefit from X-ray vision. We summarize studies reported in the literature. Drawing upon these analyses, we offer suggestions for future research on this tantalizing capability.

BT  - Foundations of Augmented Cognition
SP  - 628
EP  - 636
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Resilience is the human ability to adapt in the face of tragedy, trauma, adversity, hardship, and ongoing life stressors. To date, experimental reports on this subject have focused on long-term trajectories (weeks to months) of resilience, with little or no focus on whether significant changes to resilience could be achieved by short-term interventions. Currently, an individual’s resilience is defined either by self-report or by behavioral changes such as the development of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or suicide. We propose that the quantification of an individual’s physiological and behavioral response to stress under controlled conditions is an indication of the individual’s level of resilience. To address such real-time resilience, we propose the first in a series of studies to evaluate real-time human resilience by exposing participants to controlled stressors while assessing the stress response. Activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis and sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system via monitoring of the pupil constriction, heart and respiration rate, muscle tonicity, salivary cortisol, and electrodermal activity will be assessed. Stress exposure will consist of virtual stressors presented using Virtual Battlespace 2 software-based scenarios, such as noise exposure, time pressure, and emotion-induction tasks, as well as external stressors such as socio-evaluative stress via the Trier social stress task, while evaluating decision-making and performance. The relationship between performance and the physiological stress response will be quantified, including the creation of a series of stress-performance trajectories based upon individual differences. Such an analysis is similar to probing for resilience in material testing, in which a load is applied to a candidate material, and the resulting forces and observable changes in dimension are quantified and reported via stress-strain curves. Ongoing studies will examine how this resilience measure may be integrated into a closed-loop training system to provide appropriate coping strategies to optimize resilience training. Such training programs, which take into account individual perceptions of stressors and physiological responses, are expected to be effective in helping trainees develop resiliency during high-stress operations.

AB  - Most people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience atypical sensory modality and need help to self-regulate their sensory responses. Results of a pilot study are presented here where temperature, noise types and noise levels are used as independent variables. Attention-based tests (ABTs), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors are used as dependent variables to quantify the effects of temperature and noise. Based on the outcome of the analyses, it is feasible to use off-the-shelf sensors to recognize physiological changes, indicating a possibility to develop sensory management recommendation interventions to support people with ASD.

AB  - Sleep management, naps, and pharmacological countermeasures may be combined to assist operators requiring around the clock tasks. We used QEEG methodologies to elucidate the CNS effects of stimulants (caffeine, modafinil, and dextroamphetamine) combined with sleep deprivation. Thirty-two UH-60 pilots were tested during 87 hours of continuous wakefulness using frequency analysis to quantify eight EEG channels for up to 20 frequency bands. Data were analyzed using brain mapping techniques and repeated measure analysis of variance. After 50 hours awake, all groups showed the sleep deprivation effects: increases in slow-waves and decreases in alpha activity. Caffeine and modafinil groups appeared to have the greatest degree of effect, producing delays on the electrophysiological deterioration for up to 46 hours into the sleep deprivation cycle. Additional analysis of these data could systematically correlate cognitive tasks and QEEG data for each pharmacologic intervention.

TI  - Quantitatively exploring the relationship between eye movement and driving behavior under the effect of different complex diagrammatic guide signs
JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
AB  - Complex diagrammatic guide signs (DGSs) are widely used. To study the influence of DGSs with different complexities on drivers’ cognition, four types of typical DGSs on urban expressways in Beijing, China, were studied through a driving simulator experiment. Three indicators related to eye movement and three indicators related to driving behavior were collected and analyzed. The results indicated that the complexities of DGSs significantly increased the number of fixations, increased the number of saccades and decreased the duration of the first fixation on DGSs. More complex DGSs result in a greater difficulty for drivers in recognizing the destination on the DGSs. The complexities of DGSs also had a significant effect on driving behavior, including increasing the standard deviation of the average speed, increasing the driving distance during an acceleration change and increasing the average deceleration. When drivers observed a highly complex DGS, the vehicle speed appeared to significantly fluctuate and decrease, and drivers required a long time to comprehend the DGSs. Under the effect of different complex DGSs, indicators of the drivers’ eye movement and driving behavior are closely correlated, and the average relational degree is 0.645. In particular, relations of the number of saccades on DGSs with three indicators of driving behavior and of the driving distance during an acceleration change with two indicators of eye movement are closer than the relations between other parameters. This study provides a foundation for the influence of DGSs on drivers’ brain cognition and the optimization of complex DGSs, which will be investigated in future research.

AB  - Every purposive interactive action begins with an intention to interact. In the domain of intelligent adaptive systems, behavioral signals linked to the actions are of great importance, and even though humans are good in such predictions, interactive systems are still falling behind. We explored mouse interaction and related eye-movement data from interactive problem solving situations and isolated sequences with high probability of interactive action. To establish whether one can predict the interactive action from gaze, we 1) analyzed gaze data using sliding fixation sequences of increasing length and 2) considered sequences several fixations prior to the action, either containing the last fixation before action (i.e. the quiet eye fixation) or not. Each fixation sequence was characterized by 54 gaze features and evaluated by an SVM-RBF classifier. The results of the systematic evaluation revealed importance of the quiet eye fixation and statistical differences of quiet eye fixation compared to other fixations prior to the action.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that people tend to look at a visual referent just before saying the corresponding word, and similarly, listeners look at the referent right after hearing the name of the object. We first replicated these results in an ecologically valid situation in which collaborators are engaged in an unconstrained dialogue. Secondly, building upon these findings, we developed a model, called REGARD, which monitors speech and gaze during collaboration in order to automatically detect associations between words and objects of the shared workspace. The results are very promising showing that the model is actually able to detect correctly most of the references made by the collaborators. Perspectives of applications are briefly discussed.

AB  - This paper presents an eye-tracking study conducted in a classroom setting with seventeen students enrolled in a Computer Science program. The students were a mix of twelve first-year undergraduates (novices) and five masters students (non-novices). Students were asked to answer a comprehension question for each of thirteen C++ programs after reading them. Each program is split into a series of chunks which logically break down meaningful parts where eye gazes hint at cognition about parts of programs useful to solving problems. We analyze these patterns across chunks for the stories they tell about how participants went about searching for cues, and to learn whether their gaze patterns predicted accurate answers to three types of questions The results show that novices tend to visit print output statements and declaration statements the same amount as they do other statements in code with the exception of control block headers, which both groups tend to focus on the most across all categories. We also find that non-novices spend longer fixating inside of chunks of code before transitioning to other chunks, and tend to transition to chunks that are further away from their original position than novices.

AB  - “You are what you read.” As this sentence implies, reading is important for building our minds. We are investing a huge amount of time for reading to input information. However the activity of “reading” is done only by each individual in an analog way and nothing is digitally recorded and reused. In order to solve this problem, we record reading activities as digital data and analyze them for various goals. We call this research “reading-life log.” In this chapter, we describe our achievements of the reading-life log. A target of the reading-life log is to analyze reading activities quantitatively and qualitatively: when, how much, what you read, and how you read in terms of your interests and understanding. Body-worn sensors including intelligent eyewear are employed for this purpose. Another target is to analyze the contents of documents based on the users’ reading activities: for example, which are the parts most people feel difficult/interesting. Materials to be read are not limited to books and documents. Scene texts are also important materials which guide human activities.

Current technology allows for real time cognitive state assessment based on objective physiological data though techniques such as neuroimaging and eye tracking. Although early results indicate effective construction of classifiers that distinguish between cognitive states in real time is a possibility in some settings, implementation of these classifiers into real world settings poses a number of challenges. Cognitive states of interest must be sufficiently distinct to allow for continuous discrimination in the operational environment using technology that is currently available as well as practical to implement.

AB  - In the paper, we present a real-time algorithm optimization based on a gaze point position. The data is provided by the eye tracker and allows the effective rendering of algorithms in real-time where their accuracy depends on the distance from the point-of-regard. We present the approach based on the algorithm simulating the subsurface scattering effect. The model complexity depends on the number of parameters that should be taken into account to simulate a real effect. In order to specify model parameters correctly dependent on the gaze point position, a series of perceptual experiments must be conducted. The quality of the results will be evaluated on the basis of the single stimulus perceptual metrics.

AB  - Due to the use of thousands of often very complex process models, having them immediately usable towards their purpose is of great economic benefit. In order to maximize usability, process models must be intuitive and easily understandable. In other words, processing the information contained within the process models must enable a successful completion of the task for which the model is being used. Recently, research efforts into the effects of user characteristics on understandability have increased. However, current limitations create promising research possibilities, particularly with regard to the use of realistic process models and direct data collection techniques. This thesis will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by investigating domain knowledge as a fundamental user characteristic and utilizing eye-tracking as a direct data collection method while using realistic, complex process models. The end goal of this research is to propose an automatic process model tailoring technique, with the aim of enhancing a user’s understanding and thus their performance. As of now a pilot study has indicated the existence of distinct reading strategies, which establishes the viability of the proposed future work.

AB  - In human-computer interaction, gaze orientation is an important and promising source of information to demonstrate the attention and focus of users. Gaze detection can also be an extremely useful metric for analysing human mood and affect. Furthermore, gaze can be used as an input method for human-computer interaction. However, currently real-time and accurate gaze estimation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel estimation model of the real-time gaze direction of a user on a computer screen. This method utilises cheap capturing devices, a HD webcam and a Microsoft Kinect. We consider that the gaze motion from a user facing forwards is composed of the local gaze motion shifted by eye motion and the global gaze motion driven by face motion. We validate our proposed model of gaze estimation and provide experimental evaluation of the reliability and the precision of the method.

AB  - As the field of physical activity recognition matures, we can build more and more robust pervasive systems and slowly move towards tracking knowledge acquisition tasks. We are especially interested one particular cognitive task, namely reading (the decoding of letters, words and sentences into information) Reading is a ubiquitous activity that many people even perform in transit, such as while on the bus or while walking. Tracking reading and other high level user actions gives us more insights about the knowledge life of the users enabling a whole range of novel applications. Yet, how can we extract high level information about human activities (e.g. reading) and complex real world situations from heterogeneous ensembles of simple, often unreliable sensors embedded in commodity devices?

CY  - Cham
AB  - Humans’ cognitive and affective states are constantly subject to regular and sudden changes. The origins of these changes are multiple and unpredictable. Virtual Reality (VR) game environments could represent an immersive unconstrained experimental context in which game designers could control a wide range of parameters that act on these states. In this paper, we propose to track and adapt to individuals’ frustration and excitement levels in real time while interacting with a VR environment. We developed “AmbuRun”, a VR game designed to modify the speed and the difficulty in real time. A neural agent was created to control these parameters within the game using an intervention strategy that was intended to induce appropriate modifications of the players ‘excitement and frustration level. An experimental study involving 20 participants was conducted to evaluate our neurofeedback approach. Results showed that intelligent control through neurofeedback of speed and difficulty affected excitement and frustration before and after the agent action.

TI  - Real-time eye-gaze estimation using a low-resolution webcam
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 543

VL  - 65
IS  - 3
AB  - Eye detection and gaze estimation play an important role in many applications, e.g., the eye-controlled mouse in the assisting system for disabled or elderly persons, eye fixation and saccade in psychological analysis, or iris recognition in the security system. Traditional research usually achieves eye tracking by employing intrusive infrared-based techniques or expensive eye trackers. Nowadays, there are more and more needs to analyze user behaviors from tracking eye attention in general applications, in which users usually use a consumer-grade computer or even laptop with an inexpensive webcam. To satisfy the requirements of rapid developments of such applications and reduce the cost, it is no more practical to apply intrusive techniques or use expensive/specific equipment. In this paper, we propose a real-time eye-gaze estimation system by using a general low-resolution webcam, which can estimate eye-gaze accurately without expensive or specific equipment, and also without an intrusive detection process. An illuminance filtering approach is designed to remove the influence from light changes so that the eyes can be detected correctly from the low-resolution webcam video frames. A hybrid model combining the position criterion and an angle-based eye detection strategy are also derived to locate the eyes accurately and efficiently. In the eye-gaze estimation stage, we employ the Fourier Descriptor to describe the appearance-based features of eyes compactly. The determination of eye-gaze position is then carried out by the Support Vector Machine. The proposed algorithms have high performances with low computational complexity. The experiment results also show the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Real-time saliency-aware video abstraction
JO  - The Visual Computer
SP  - 973
VL  - 25
IS  - 11
AB  - Existing real-time automatic video abstraction systems rely on local contrast only for identifying perceptually important information and abstract imagery by reducing contrast in low-contrast regions while artificially increasing contrast in higher contrast regions. These methods, however, may fail to accentuate an object against its background for the images with objects of low contrast over background of high contrast. To solve this problem, we propose a progressive abstraction method based on a region-of-interest function derived from an elaborate perception model. Visual contents in perceptually salient regions are emphasized, whereas the background is abstracted appropriately. In addition, the edge-preserving smoothing and line drawing algorithms in this paper are guided by a vector field which describes the flow of salient features of the input image. The whole pipeline can be executed automatically in real time on the GPU, without requiring any user intervention. Several experimental examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - We developed and studied an experimental system, RealTourist, which lets a user to plan a conference trip with the help of a remote tourist consultant who could view the tourist’s eye-gaze superimposed onto a shared map. Data collected from the experiment were analyzed in conjunction with literature review on speech and eye-gaze patterns. This inspective, exploratory research identified various functions of gaze-overlay on shared spatial material including: accurate and direct display of partner’s eye-gaze, implicit deictic referencing, interest detection, common focus and topic switching, increased redundancy and ambiguity reduction, and an increase of assurance, confidence, and understanding. This study serves two purposes. The first is to identify patterns that can serve as a basis for designing multimodal human-computer dialogue systems with eye-gaze locus as a contributing channel. The second is to investigate how computer-mediated communication can be supported by the display of the partner’s eye-gaze.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose a new approach for a human’s implicit intention recognition system based on an eyeball movement pattern analysis. In this paper, we present a comprehensive classification of human’s implicit intention. Based on Bernard’s research, we define the Human’s implicit intention as informational and navigational intent. The intent for navigational searching is to locate a particular interesting object in an input scene. The intent for informational searching is to locate interesting area concerning a particular topic in order to obtain information from a specific location. In the proposed model, eyeball movement pattern analysis is considered for classifying the two different types of implicit intention. The experimental results show that the proposed model generates plausible recognition performance using a fixation length and counts with a simple nearest neighborhood classifier.

AB  - Eye detection and tracking is usually performed by using specific devices that allow to determine the pupil position in many different situations. We propose to use these techniques for recognizing cognitive activities that a potential user is carrying out in front of a computer. We use the images captured by a conventional web camera located over the computer display. Those image are processed and, after the face and facial landmarks are found, the user gaze is analyzed and the ethogram and several statistics associated to the eyes and gaze destination are computed. They are used for determining what is doing the user from a set of predefined activities.

TI  - Recognizing Visual Attention Allocation Patterns Using Gaze Behaviors

PB  - Springer Singapore
CY  - Singapore
AB  - Human Attention Allocation Strategy (HAAS) is related closely to operating performance when he/she is interacting a machine through a human-machine interface. Gaze behaviors, which is acquisited by eye tracking technology, can be used to observe attention allocation. But the performance-sensitive attention allocation strategy is still hard to measure using gaze cue. In this paper, we attempt to understand visual attention allocation behavior and reveal the relationship between attention allocation strategy and interactive performance in a quantitative manner. By using a novel Multiple-Level Clustering approach, we give some results on probabilistic analysis about interactive performance of HAAS patterns in a simulation platform of thermal-hydraulic process plant. It can be observed that these patterns are sensitive to interactive performance. We conclude that our Multiple-Level Clustering approach can extract efficiently human attention allocation patterns and evaluate interactive performance using gaze movements.

AB  - This work describes the proof and uses of a theorem allowing definition of recursive functions over the type of λ-calculus terms, where terms with bound variables are identified up to α-equivalence. The theorem embodies what is effectively a principle of primitive recursion, and the analogues of this theorem for other types with binders are clear. The theorem’s side-conditions require that the putative definition be well-behaved with respect to fresh name generation and name permutation. A number of examples over the type of λ-calculus terms illustrate the use of the new principle.

We also consider restraining the possible rules to some basic ones in order to make the reduction trees easy to build, and a way to use them for learning will be presented.

AB  - We prove that Plotkin's model of bottomless cpos and partial continuous functions [19] is fully abstract for PCFv, a call-by-yalue version of the language PCF [17]. This settles a ‘folk theorem’ which has occasionally been misunderstood. We then show that the (known) full abstraction results for lazy PCF [2] and PCF with control [22] can be derived as corollaries from this theorem. Such a connection is particularly surprising, because observational congruence—the central notion in the definition of full abstraction—is usually not preserved by many known translations between different programming languages. We expect that new full abstraction theorems for some extensions of PCFv can be derived in the same way.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper we propose a framework that characterizes user interaction with webGIS. Furthermore we present a technique to remotely test and evaluate such systems. Our framework does not only include parameters describing the usability of a system, but refers to factors that we argue influence interaction and satisfaction substantially, such as the user’s background and previous experience, or the user’s computer equipment. We have developed tools and techniques to test webGIS remotely so that users can evaluate the system in their own environment rather than an intrusive laboratory. This remote-testing environment allows us to record parameters such as task completion time, the rate of interactions but also the type of operating system and network connection used during the evaluation. In a case study we captured the interaction of more than 300 users with a system whose purpose was to locate points of interest in a region of Switzerland. The data that was gathered during this remote-evaluation was used to validate and verify the conceptual framework. We have found out that parameters such as the user’s experience with similar systems or the type of input device and connection speed significantly influence both the interaction and the user’s satisfaction. The tools and the framework that we present in this paper are useful for developers and designers of webGIS, but also for researchers who are interested in evaluating the usability of such systems.

SP  - 157
EP  - 178
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Advances in automation will soon enable a single operator to supervise multiple unmanned aerial vehicles. Successfully implementing this new supervisory control paradigm not only requires improvements in automation capability and reliability, but also an understanding of the human performance issues associated with concurrent management of several automated systems. Research in this area has generally focused on topics such as trust, reliability, and levels of automation. The goal of automating systems is generally to minimize the human’s need to directly interact with the system; despite this objective, the majority of current supervisory control research emphasizes situations in which the human must frequently interact with the automation. This is typically done to provide researchers with a clear means of assessing human performance, but ultimately limits the generalizability of the research since it only applies to a limited mission context. The current chapter discusses a model of assessing human-automation interaction that emphasizes not only the traditional outcome-based measures of assessing performance (e.g., speed and accuracy), but also addresses measures of operator state. Such measures include those obtained from subjective workload and fatigue probes, situation awareness (SA) probes, and continuous measures from eye tracking systems. The chapter closes by discussing a new testbed developed by the authors that enables the assessment of human-automation interaction across a broad range of mission contexts.

AB  - Along with the development of interactive interface design technology, interface display becomes increasingly dynamic, multi-functional and logically-complex that increases the difficulty of interactive interface evaluation. The traditional evaluation methods of interactive interface cannot meet the requirements of interface evaluation due to its poor objectivity and economy. However, it is possible to predict the cognitive process of users by constructing human cognitive model as the development of cognitive psychology, and the interactive interface evaluation method based on the cognitive process of users is of feasibility and utmost urgency. This paper proposed a Cogtool-based interactive interface evaluation method that predicts the interactive process in terms of human’s cognitive characteristics, which significantly improves the objectivity of interface evaluation and has the advantages of economy and convenience.

AB  - This article uses gesture recognition technology to study the culture, structure and performing form of traditional Chinese puppet show. It aims at annotating traditional culture by using new media art language. Taking “Puppet” as an example, this article summarizes the characteristics of controlling the marionette under gesture recognition technology as well as the binding point design in both traditional way and new technology by analyzing the characters. Through communication and interviews with the inheritors of the intangible cultural heritage, this paper discusses the new and old performing form and controlling features. This research lowers the threshold of learning puppet show, and puppet show fans only need to use simple operations to perform complicated movements. The cost of learning the puppet show decreases because of HCI. This article annotates the traditional meaning of gesture control under new technology background by comparing the new and old controlling form.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The rapid development of technology constantly changes the way advertising is transmitted. In recent years, more and more brands have chosen to use game advertising on social media to spread brand information. Faced with this new form of advertising, the industry is still adopting the existing evaluation system and method, lacking the research and application of the supporting effect evaluation system, ignoring the analysis of the special attributes of such advertisements, leading to the lack of accuracy in evaluation of advertising effects. In view of the current problem, this paper adopts the method of eye movement experiment, taking social game advertisement as an example, establishes the effect evaluation model of social game advertisement, and obtains the design principle of social game advertisement. It is verified by the second experiment that the result shows that the effect evaluation model is effective, and the proposed design principles are feasible. This helps advertisers to accurately and effectively grasp the communication advantages and disadvantages of social game advertising when measuring the effectiveness of advertising, and provide objective data support for the later adjustment of advertising delivery strategy. It is expected to provide an empirical reference for the industry to measure the effectiveness of social game advertising, enrich the theoretical research on the evaluation of social game advertising effectiveness, and provide reference for the application of eye movement experiment in social game advertising research.

AB  - A product design elements evaluation model was proposed, which was constructed by eye tracking experiments, using eye movement indicators such as first gaze time, gaze order, and number of times of return, to accurately and effectively analyze product model and quantify users’ emotion. The purpose of sorting the product model contribution was achieved through the weight calculation of the design elements. The soymilk machine shape was used as a case to verify the rationality of the evaluation model. The results showed that the “cup” part of the soymilk machine was the most concerned by the subjects, while the “handle” part was the least concerned. At the same time, the further research direction of design elements evaluation in eye movement experiment and the coupling between design elements, and product modeling image were discussed at the end of the article. The further research directions and experimental design methods were clarified.

AB  - The problem of aging has become an important issue in today’s society. It is the social responsibility of scholars to study into it. The purpose of this study is to find out elderly’s Kansei needs based on the living conditions of different regions in China. Through an investigation of the living habits of the elderly over 80 years old, the requirements of the design of the elderly products are analyzed. According to the analysis of the connotation and extension of the elderly living habits, the preferred Kansei image is sought, and corresponding design elements are extracted. A system that derives the preferred Kansei image with appropriate design elements is established. In this paper, Kansei Engineering research method is used to investigate the visual, auditory, perceptual and behavioral responses of the elderly and then establish a Kansei Engineering Forwarding System with Kansei adjectives database, design element data base and corresponding logical deduction rules. First, we studied the awareness, personality, aesthetics, diversity, happiness and comfort feelings of the elderly. Followed by interviews and questionnaire surveys to acquire elderly’s physiological and psychological characteristics, lifestyle and use environment of daily products. Then an experiment was carried out to measure elderly’s Kansei preference and to identify the corresponding design elements. Finally, a Kansei Engineering System for new design patterns in line with the elderly’s Kansei preference is established. And the product design and development for the elderly can be carried out with the system. According to the research results, the above-mentioned forward Kansei Engineering System that transforms Kansei image into specific design elements to enhance the experience of the products pays more attention to the Kansei preference of elderly users while pursuing product quality. Hopefully, the elderly people can feel the Kansei value of the design and lead a creative life.

TI  - Research on learning progress tracking of multimedia port user based on improved CamShift algorithm
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - Aiming at the shortcomings of the existing methods which lead to low tracking accuracy, poor real-time performance and low tracking success rate, this paper proposes a method for learning progress tracking of multimedia port user based on improved CamShift algorithm. The infrared image is processed by multimedia technology, and the binary image is obtained. The initial pupil center position is obtained in the image. Finally, the eye tracking algorithm based on improved CamShift is used to further track the initial pupil center, and the learning progress tracking of multimedia port user is realized. The experimental results show that the average time consumed by the proposed method is 0.0065 s and the average number of iterations is 1.5. The real-time performance of the proposed method is the best, and the success rate of eye tracking is more than 80%. The overall performance of the proposed method is good.

AB  - With the continuous development of the times, online merchandise sales have become one of the more important shopping channels for consumers. But for online sales, consumers can’t directly contact the goods, so online product display has an important impact on the shopping experience. In this study, eye tracking and subjective perception were used to explore the behavioral and perceived differences of consumers in different display modes. Under different display modes, consumers have different gaze duration, gaze trajectory and subjective perception. This study provides some suggestions and considerations for the follow-up study of online merchandise display.

AB  - Technology-assisted intervention has the potential to adaptively individualize and improve outcomes of traditional schizophrenia (SZ) intervention. Virtual reality (VR) technology, in particular, has the potential to simulate real world social and communication interactions and hence could be useful as a therapeutic platform for SZ. Emotional face recognition is considered among the core building blocks of social communication. Studies have shown that emotional face processing and understanding is impaired in patients with SZ. The current study develops a novel VR-based system that presents avatars that can change their facial emotion dynamically for emotion recognition tasks. Additionally, this system allows real-time measurement of physiological signals and eye gaze during the emotion recognition tasks, which can be used to gain insight about the emotion recognition process in SZ population. This study further compares VR-based facial emotion recognition with that of the more traditional emotion recognition from static faces using a small usability study. Results from the usability study suggest that VR could be a viable platform for SZ intervention and implicit signals such as physiological signals and eye gaze can be utilized to better understand the underlying pattern that is not available from user reports and performance alone.

AB  - Eye-tracking equipment has proven useful in examining the cognitive processes people use when understanding and reasoning with diagrams. However, eye-tracking has several drawbacks: accurate eye-tracking equipment is expensive, often awkward for participants, requires frequent re-calibration and the data can be difficult to interpret. We introduce an alternative tool for diagram research: the Restricted Focus Viewer (RFV). This is a computer program which takes an image, blurs it and displays it on a computer monitor, allowing the participant to see only a small region of the image in focus at any time. The region in focus can be moved using the computer mouse. The RFV records what the participant is focusing on at any point in time. It is cheap, non-intrusive, does not require calibration and provides accurate data about which region is being focused upon. We describe this tool, and also provide an experimental comparison with eye-tracking. We show that the RFV gives similar results to those obtained by Hegarty (1992) when using eye-tracking equipment to investigate reasoning about mechanical diagrams.

AB  - This chapter demonstrates the link between human cognition states and Machine Learning (ML) with a multimodal interface. A framework of informed decision making called DecisionMind is proposed to show how human’s behaviour and physiological signals are used to reveal human cognition states in ML-based decision making. The chapter takes the revealing of user confidence in ML-based decision making as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on the revealing of human cognition states during ML-based decision making, the chapter presents a concept of adaptive measurable decision making to show how the revealing of human cognition states are integrated into ML-based decision making to make ML transparent. On the one hand, human cognition states could help understand to what degree humans accept innovative technologies. On the other hand, through understanding human cognition states during ML-based decision making, ML-based decision attributes/factors and even ML models can be adaptively refined in order to make ML transparent.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose a datamining based method for automated reverse engineering of search strategies during active visual search tasks. The method uses a genetic program (GP) that evolves populations of fuzzy decision trees and selects an optimal one. Previous psychophysical observations of subjects engaged in a simple search task result in a database of stimulus conditions and concomitant measures of eye gaze information and associated psychophysical metrics that globally describe the subjects search strategies. Fuzzy rules about the likely design properties of the components of the visual system involved in selecting fixation location during search are defined based on these metrics. A fitness function that incorporates both the fuzzy rules and the information in the database is used to conduct GP based datamining. The information extracted through the GP process is the internal design specification of the visual system vis-à-vis active visual search.

As this system needs no equipment in the environment, the user can apply it anywhere on a flat floor with only the wearable system. In this paper, we show how to estimate the positions and orientations of the robots and the gazed position. We also describe implementation of the robot navigation system.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this work we analyse the eye movements of people in transit in an everyday environment using a wearable electrooculographic (EOG) system. We compare three approaches for continuous recognition of reading activities: a string matching algorithm which exploits typical characteristics of reading signals, such as saccades and fixations; and two variants of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) - mixed Gaussian and discrete. The recognition algorithms are evaluated in an experiment performed with eight subjects reading freely chosen text without pictures while sitting at a desk, standing, walking indoors and outdoors, and riding a tram. A total dataset of roughly 6 hours was collected with reading activity accounting for about half of the time. We were able to detect reading activities over all subjects with a top recognition rate of 80.2% (71.0% recall, 11.6% false positives) using string matching. We show that EOG is a potentially robust technique for reading recognition across a number of typical daily situations.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Human attention plays an important role in human visual system. We assume that the Gestalt law is one of important factors to guide human selective attention. In this paper, we present a series of studies in which we hypothesized that regions of image that get more attention in an object recognition task, confirm to one or more gestalt principles and subconsciously attract human attention which eventually help in object recognition. In our study, we collected attention parts of images by analyzing eye movement of participants. Then we compared Gestalt scores of high attention parts with those of nonattended random parts. Our results suggest that continuity and symmetry of features attract human attention. We argue that an approach to analyze parts with high Gestalt scores can yield better than analyzing random parts of image in object recognition.

We explore the concept of naïve ontology as the bases for designing browsing/navigation interface of search and learn for domain novices of digital libraries. Naïve ontology is a type of information access interface which allows domain novices to refine their knowledge interactively by acquiring information chunk-by-chunk as they encounter it in digital libraries. Through elicitation and analysis of search and learn processes of domain novices in history and geography, we identified several implications for designing naïve ontology.

AB  - This article presents research on pursuit eye movements tests conducted on patients with Parkinson’s disease in various stages of disease and phases of treatment. The aim of described experiment was to develop algorithms allowing for measurements of parameters of pursuit eye movement in order to reference calculated results to the previously collected neurological data of patients. An additional objective of the experiment was to develop an example of data-mining procedure, allowing for classification of neurological symptoms based on oculometric measurements. Definition of such correlation enables assignment of particular patient to a given neurological group on the base of parameters values of pursuit eye movements. By using created decision table, we have achieved good results of prediction of the neurological parameter UPDRS, with total accuracy of 93.3% and total coverage of 60%. This allows for better evaluation of stage of the disease and its progression. It also might provide additional tool in determining efficacy of different disease treatments.

TI  - Route Guidance Modality for Elder Driver Navigation
BT  - Pervasive Computing
SP  - 179
EP  - 196
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Differences in perceptual and cognitive abilities between the young and elderly have implications for in-car tasks. As a primary example, although in-car navigation systems enhance situational awareness, this comes at the cost of increasing visual distraction and cognitive load. To address these shortcomings, this paper explores the efficacy of multi-modal cues for providing route guidance information. We present the results of a study evaluating the impact of multi-modal feedback on driving performance and cognitive load. We found that the full combination of visual, auditory, and haptic feedback was generally most useful to reduce way-finding errors. However, our study highlighted a number of differences between elder and younger drivers for their safer navigation. Adding more modalities strained the already high workload of elder drivers. In contrast, adding haptic feedback to traditional audio and visual feedback led to more attentive driving by younger drivers. Therefore, for elder drivers, navigation systems need to be personalized to enhance the benefit of auditory feedback without increasing the number of sensory feedbacks. For younger drivers, it is necessary to incorporate new non-visual feedback to minimize distractions caused by visual feedback. We demonstrate these results through task performance-based measures, subjective workload measures and through objective workload measures that use psychophysiological responses of participants to predict a driver’s cognitive load in near real-time.

AB  - We propose a method using eye-gaze tracking technology and machine learning for the analysis of the reading section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). An eye-gaze tracking device tracks where the reader is looking on the screen and provides the coordinates of the gaze. This collected data allows us to analyze the reading patterns of test takers and discover what features enable test takers to score higher. Using a machine learning approach, we found that the time spent on the passage at the beginning of the test (in minutes), number of times switching between the passage and the questions, and the total time spent doing the reading test (in minutes) have the greatest impact in distinguishing higher scores from lower scores.

TI  - SEQUENCE: a remote control technique to select objects by matching their rhythm
JO  - Personal and Ubiquitous Computing
SP  - 751
EP  - 770
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
AB  - We present SEQUENCE, a novel interaction technique for selecting objects from a distance. Objects display different rhythmic patterns by means of animated dots, and users can select one of them by matching the pattern through a sequence of taps on a smartphone. The technique works by exploiting the temporal coincidences between patterns displayed by objects and sequences of taps performed on a smartphone: if a sequence matches with the pattern displayed by an object, the latter is selected. We propose two different alternatives for displaying rhythmic sequences associated with objects: the first one uses fixed dots (FD), the second one rotating dots (RD). Moreover, we performed two evaluations on such alternatives. The first evaluation, carried out with five participants, was aimed to discover the most appropriate speed for displaying animated rhythmic patterns. The second evaluation, carried out on 12 participants, was aimed to discover errors (i.e., activation of unwanted objects), missed activations (within a certain time), and time of activations. Overall, the proposed design alternatives perform in similar ways (errors, 2.8% for FD and 3.7% for RD; missed, 1.3% for FD and 0.9% for RD; time of activation, 3862 ms for FD and 3789 ms for RD).

JO  - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
SP  - 293
EP  - 331
VL  - 26
IS  - 1
AB  - The SMILI☺ (Student Models that Invite the Learner In) Open Learner Model Framework was created to provide a coherent picture of the many and diverse forms of Open Learner Models (OLMs). The aim was for SMILI☺ to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been neglected. However, we observed that SMILI☺ was not used in these ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI☺ paper, much has changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning. This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and reflecting on the use of SMILI☺, this paper presents a revised and simpler version of SMILI☺ alongside the original version. In both cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more research.

TI  - SPOSS: Secure Pin-Based-Authentication Obviating Shoulder Surfing
BT  - Information Systems Security
SP  - 66
EP  - 86
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Classical PIN based authentication schemes are susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks and hence attacker may obtain secret credentials of legitimate user very easily. Some of the existing schemes that provide resistance against shoulder surfing attacks either require multiple rounds for entering single digit or some have dependency on external hardware or some of the schemes require complex computation to be done mentally in order to enter the PIN. Another possible security threat could be stealing the credentials if password file is compromised. In this paper, we propose a new PIN entry mechanism known as SPOSS which provides resilience against not only human-based shoulder surfing but also against recording attack (for one session) in which attacker may impose a recording device like camera to record the whole login session for future reference. SPOSS also provides security against password file compromise attack. Additionally, user authentication can be ensured by single round only without doing any complex computation and without any dependency of external hardware. Experimental analysis shows that proposed scheme achieves a good balance between usability and security parameters.

SP  - 504
EP  - 520
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper presents a novel spherical convolutional neural network based scheme for saliency detection for $$360^\circ $$360∘videos. Specifically, in our spherical convolution neural network definition, kernel is defined on a spherical crown, and the convolution involves the rotation of the kernel along the sphere. Considering that the $$360^\circ $$360∘videos are usually stored with equirectangular panorama, we propose to implement the spherical convolution on panorama by stretching and rotating the kernel based on the location of patch to be convolved. Compared with existing spherical convolution, our definition has the parameter sharing property, which would greatly reduce the parameters to be learned. We further take the temporal coherence of the viewing process into consideration, and propose a sequential saliency detection by leveraging a spherical U-Net. To validate our approach, we construct a large-scale $$360^\circ $$360∘videos saliency detection benchmark that consists of 104 $$360^\circ $$360∘videos viewed by 20+ human subjects. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our spherical U-net for $$360^\circ $$360∘video saliency detection.

AB  - Despite all recent progress in computer vision, humans are still far superior to machines when it comes to the high-level understanding of complex dynamic scenes. The apparent ease of human perception and action cannot be explained by sheer neural computation power alone: Estimates put the transmission rate of the optic nerve at only about 10 MBit/s. One particular effective strategy to reduce the computational burden of vision in biological systems is the combination of attention with space-variant processing, where only subsets of the visual scene are processed in full detail at any one time. Here, we report on experiments that mimic eye movements and attention as a preprocessing step for state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Human visual fixations play a vital role in a plethora of genres, ranging from advertising design to human-computer interaction. Considering saliency in images thus brings significant merits to Computer Vision tasks dealing with human perception. Several classification models have been developed to incorporate various feature levels and estimate free eye-gazes. However, for real-time applications (Here, real-time applications refer to those that are time, and often resource-constrained, requiring speedy results. It does not imply on-line data analysis), the deep convolution neural networks are either difficult to deploy, given current hardware limitations or the proposed classifiers cannot effectively combine image semantics with low-level attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to predict human fixations, specifically aimed at advertisements. Such analysis significantly impacts the brand value and assists in audience measurement. A dataset containing 400 print ads across 21 successful brands was used to successfully evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements and their associated fixations, based on the proposed saliency prediction model.

SP  - 237

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Visual salience detection originated over 500 million years ago and is one of nature’s most efficient mechanisms. In contrast, many state-of-the-art computational saliency models are complex and inefficient. Most saliency models process high-resolution color images; however, insights into the evolutionary origins of visual salience detection suggest that achromatic low-resolution vision is essential to its speed and efficiency. Previous studies showed that low-resolution color and high-resolution grayscale images preserve saliency information. However, to our knowledge, no one has investigated whether saliency is preserved in low-resolution grayscale (LG) images. In this study, we explain the biological and computational motivation for LG, and show, through a range of human eye-tracking and computational modeling experiments, that saliency information is preserved in LG images. Moreover, we show that using LG images leads to significant speedups in model training and detection times and conclude by proposing LG images for fast and efficient salience detection.

AB  - Saliency modeling has become one of the most popular studies in computer vision. Many previous works adopted distinctness to compute saliency score of an image element, which usually need point-to-point distances calculation and it is quadratic complexity. In this paper, a visual saliency model based on one time sampling outlier detection is proposed, and the time complexity is linear to image size, further analyses and experiments demonstrate that our model is robust and efficient. This model is parameter insensitive, without learning, and easy to implement. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model is competitive compare with state-of-the-art models under shuffled AUC metric.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Theories and models on saliency that predict where people look at focus on regular-density scenes. A crowded scene is characterized by the co-occurrence of a relatively large number of regions/objects that would have stood out if in a regular scene, and what drives attention in crowd can be significantly different from the conclusions in the regular setting. This work presents a first focused study on saliency in crowd. To facilitate saliency in crowd study, a new dataset of 500 images is constructed with eye tracking data from 16 viewers and annotation data on faces (the dataset will be publicly available with the paper). Statistical analyses point to key observations on features and mechanisms of saliency in scenes with different crowd levels and provide insights as of whether conventional saliency models hold in crowding scenes. Finally a new model for saliency prediction that takes into account the crowding information is proposed, and multiple kernel learning (MKL) is used as a core computational module to integrate various features at both low- and high-levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art in saliency computation.

JO  - Frontiers of Computer Science
SP  - 183

VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - This article proposes a novel framework for the recognition of six universal facial expressions. The framework is based on three sets of features extracted from a face image: entropy, brightness, and local binary pattern. First, saliency maps are obtained using the state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithm “frequency-tuned salient region detection”. The idea is to use saliency maps to determine appropriate weights or values for the extracted features (i.e., brightness and entropy). We have performed a visual experiment to validate the performance of the saliency detection algorithm against the human visual system. Eye movements of 15 subjects were recorded using an eye-tracker in free-viewing conditions while they watched a collection of 54 videos selected from the Cohn-Kanade facial expression database. The results of the visual experiment demonstrated that the obtained saliency maps are consistent with the data on human fixations. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated via satisfactory classification results achieved with the Cohn-Kanade database, FG-NET FEED database, and Dartmouth database of children’s faces.

AB  - We provide a comprehensive evaluation of salient object detection (SOD) models. Our analysis identifies a serious design bias of existing SOD datasets which assumes that each image contains at least one clearly outstanding salient object in low clutter. The design bias has led to a saturated high performance for state-of-the-art SOD models when evaluated on existing datasets. The models, however, still perform far from being satisfactory when applied to real-world daily scenes. Based on our analyses, we first identify 7 crucial aspects that a comprehensive and balanced dataset should fulfill. Then, we propose a new high quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. Specifically, our SOC (Salient Objects in Clutter) dataset, includes images with salient and non-salient objects from daily object categories. Beyond object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes. Finally, we report attribute-based performance assessment on our dataset.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Mind-wandering or loss of focus is a frequently occurring experience for many learners and negatively impacts learning outcomes. While in a classroom setting, a skilled teacher may be able to react to students’ loss of focus, in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) no such intervention is possible (yet). Previous studies suggest a strong relationship between learners’ mind-wandering and their gaze, making it possible to detect mind-wandering in real-time using eye-tracking devices. Existing research in this area though has made use of specialized (and expensive) hardware, and thus cannot be employed in MOOC scenarios due to the inability to scale beyond lab settings. In order to make a step towards scalable mind-wandering detection among online learners, we propose the use of ubiquitously available consumer grade webcams. In a controlled study, we compare the accuracy of mind-wandering detection from gaze data recorded through a standard webcam and recorded through a specialized and high-quality eye tracker. Our results suggest that a large-scale application of webcam-based mind-wandering detection in MOOCs is indeed possible.

AB  - In the previous chapter, we discussed how cognitive information derived from the eye-movement patterns of the annotators can be used to model annotation complexity for translation and sentiment annotation. We realize, gaze data, a form of subconscious annotation can be useful for labeling training data with complexity scores, when manually assigning such labels becomes extremely difficult due to its highly subjective nature. We rather rely on simplistic gaze-based measures like total fixation duration to label our data, and then predict the labels using derivable textual features. While measuring annotation complexity through total fixation/saccade duration may seem robust under the assumption that “complex tasks require more time,” it seems more intuitive to consider the complexity of eye-movement patterns in their entirety to derive such labels.

One setting would be a virtual immersive environment made of a dome including spherical projection, surround sound, where visitors comfortably lying down on an interactive mattress can appreciate exquisite corpses floating on the ceiling of the dome, animated, with sound, dependent of the overall behavior of the visitors. On tabletops, creators can generate comic-strip-like creatures by collage or sketching, and associate audiovisual behaviors and soundscapes to these. This creation system will be used in hospitals towards a living lab comforting patients in accepting their health trip. Both settings are inspired by snoezelen methods. These crossover scenarios associate a project by L’Art-Chétype retained to be featured for Mons 2015 EU Capital of Culture and other partners aiming at designing an environment for experiencing/authoring interactive comic-strips augmented with sound.

JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
SP  - 2401
EP  - 2425
VL  - 78
IS  - 2
AB  - In usability studies involving eye-tracking, quantitative analysis of gaze data requires the information about so called scene occurrences. Scene ocurrences are time segments during which the application user interface remains more-less static, so gaze events (e.g., fixations) can be mapped to the particular areas of interest (user interface elements). The scene occurrences typically start and end by user interface changes such as page-to-page transitions, menu expansions, overlay propmts, etc. Normally, one would record such changes programmatically through application logging, yet in many studies, this is not possible. For example, in an early-prototype mobile-app testing, only a camera recording of a smart device screen is often available as evidence. In such cases, analysts must manually annotate the recordings. To reduce the need for manual annotation of scene occurrences, we present an image processing method for segmenting user interface video recordings. The method exploits specific properties of user interface recordings, which greatly differ from real world video shots (for which many segmentation methods exist). The core of our method lies in the use of SSIM and SIFT similarity metrics used on video frames (with several pre-processing and filtering procedures). The main advantage of our method is, that it requires no training data apart from single screenshot example for each scene (to which the recording frames are compared). The method is also able to work with user finger overlays, which are always present in mobile device recordings. We evaluate the accuracy of our method over recordings from several real-life studies and compare it with other image similarity techniques.

AB  - The World Wide Web plays a central role in many aspects of our modern life. In particular, using search engines to access information about products and services has become an integral part of our day-to-day activities. In this study we look at users’ viewing behavior on search engine results pages (SERPs) through the lens of competition for attention theory. While this theory has been used for examining consumer behavior on e-commerce websites, little work has been done to test this theory for viewing behavior on SERPs. We use eye tracking data to analyze viewing behavior. The results show that viewing behavior can have an impact on a user experience and effective search, providing theoretical direction for studying the viewing behavior of SERPs.

SP  - 251
EP  - 266
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Evaluation plays an essential way in Information Retrieval (IR) researches. Existing Web search evaluation methodologies usually come in two ways: offline and online methods. The benchmarks generated by offline methods (e.g. Cranfield-like ones) could be easily reused. However, the evaluation metrics in these methods are usually based on various user behavior assumptions (e.g. Cascade assumption) and may not well accord with actual user behaviors. Online methods, in contrast, can well capture users’ actual preferences while the results are not usually reusable. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation problem where users are using search engines to finish complex tasks. These tasks usually involve multiple queries in a single search session and propose challenges to both offline and online evaluation methodologies. To tackle this problem, we propose a search success evaluation framework based on machine translation model. In this framework, we formulate the search success evaluation problem as a machine translation evaluation problem: the ideal search outcome (i.e. necessary information to finish the task) is considered as the reference while search outcome from individual users (i.e. content that are perceived by users) as the translation. Thus, we adopt BLEU, a long standing machine translation evaluation metric, to evaluate the success of searchers. This framework avoids the introduction of possibly unreliable behavior assumptions and is reusable as well. We also tried a number of automatic methods which aim to minimize assessors’ efforts based on search interaction behavior such as eye-tracking and click-through. Experimental results indicate that the proposed evaluation method well correlates with explicit feedback on search satisfaction from search users. It is also suitable for search success evaluation when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.

We are currently analyzing these data.

AB  - Interaction Designers of heavy vehicles are challenged by two opposing forces, the increasingly information-driven systems resulting in higher visual load, and a must to support a focus on the area of operation. To succeed in the interaction design and application of new technology, a good understanding of the user and the activity is needed. However, field studies are related with substantial efforts for both researcher and operator. This paper investigates and shows how quick non-intrusive studies can be held, by bridging practice from one HCI area into another, i.e. applying guerilla testing approaches used in mobile and web development into the heavy vehicles domain, an area not used to this practice. An exploratory study is performed, on a diverse set of vehicles in the field. This study describes and presents examples how both qualitative and quantitative conclusions can be extracted on the user attentiveness to digital systems and surrounding.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Salient object detection is an important task for both the human perception and computer vision applications. Contrary to the popular pixel- or superpixel-based salient object detection methods, we employ high quality segmentation to facilitate salient object detection in this paper. After segmenting the input image using a recent method of gPb-owt-ucm, we easily extract the salient objects from candidate segments only with some very simple intrinsic features of the segments. In addition, for more reasonable performance evaluation, we build a perception based dataset, which contains 499 complex natural images and the corresponding hierarchical salient object ground-truth defined with the assistance of eye-tracker recorded fixations. Experiments on the public ASD dataset and our new dataset show that our segmentation-based salient object detection method (SBSO) achieves competitive performance comparing to some state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - As our interactions increasingly cut across diverse devices, we often encounter situations where we find information on one device but wish to use it on another device, for instance, a phone number spotted on a public display but wanted on a mobile. We conceptualize this problem as Select & Apply and contribute two user studies where we presented participants with eight different scenarios involving different device combinations, applications and data types. In the first, we used a think-aloud methodology to gain insights on how users currently accomplish such tasks and how they ideally would like to accomplish them. In the second, we conducted a focus group study to investigate which factors influence their actions. Results indicate shortcomings in present support for Select & Apply and contribute a better understanding of which factors affect cross-device interaction.

The associations between attention devoted to metadata elements and selecting an interesting book were analyzed. Eye movements of 30 users selecting fiction for four search tasks were recorded. The results indicate that although participants paid most attention in book pages to content description and keywords, these had no bearing on selecting an interesting book. Author and title information received less attention, but were significant predictors of selection.

AB  - With growing use of mobile devices, mobile advertisement is playing increasingly important role. It can reach potential customers at any time and place based on individual’s real-time needs. Factors for success of mobile advertisements are different from similar media like Television or large screen monitors. We investigated the important factors to enhance click through rate (CTR) for a mobile Ad. As CTR is directly related to revenue, it is used to measure success of a mobile Ad. To identify important factors that determine CTR, we took two approaches - one directly asking subjects, and the other, from analyzing their selective attention. Subjects were asked to respond to questionnaire. From the responses important features were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). For the other approach, selective attention was inferred from subjects’ eye-tracking data. When results from two approaches were compared, the findings were similar. Those features will be helpful for designing Ads favored by users, as well as could earn more revenues.

AB  - One of the major issues in banking is “consumer loan”. Most of the banks allow customers to apply for a “personal” or “generic” loan online. This procedure requires filling out forms with some “familiar data” and calculating the rates and fees for the total cost. Although online banking is a supported feature of banking in general, every system offers a different path for the same experience. This pilot study, which is the first step of a long-term study, focuses on three different bank web sites in Turkey and investigates the “find and search” strategies that users employ in order to apply for a specific amount of loan. For this purpose a qualitative usability test, based on a multi-method approach, was carried out with a sample of 11 Turkish senior year university students who were experienced Internet users and potential new customers. The participants were observed during the task executions and additional data was collected by the “think aloud” procedure, eye-tracking and video recording of the participants. Complementary data on user experience was collected by a final debriefing interview. The findings revealed significant usability problems caused specifically by the user interface features and information architecture of each system and enable to propose guidelines to improve user experience in form design and/or check-out process.

TI  - Semantic content of motorcycle riders’ eye fixations during lane-splitting
JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
AB  - A naturalistic field observation study is presented, exploring the experienced riders’ eye fixations on specific traffic objects and their relative semantic content during lane-splitting manoeuvre in urban settings. Six experienced motorcyclists rode their own motorcycles equipped with an eye-tracking system. Data were extracted using manual video annotation and stimulated retrospective think-aloud methods. In total, 54 cases of lane-splitting (i.e., passing between a consecutive set of three moving cars) were analysed in terms of traffic objects and car-body parts fixated upon. Eye-fixation results on traffic objects show that all six riders tended to fixate less on the nearest target cars, allocating more fixations in monitoring the farthest target car and traffic ahead. In addition, all six riders fixated consistently on specific car-body parts of the target cars, namely, on the front body parts of the nearest target car (i.e. wing mirror, front side window, and front wing/tyre) and on the rear body parts of the farthest target car (i.e., rear light, rear quarter pillar, and rear wing/tyre). Riders’ commentaries revealed that the aforementioned fixations were intentionally made in search of (1) assessing the level of drivers’ attentiveness of the neighboring car(s), and (2) anticipating the possible path deviations of the neighboring car(s), for monitoring the upcoming contingencies in the traffic ahead rather than simply monitoring the actual movements of the target cars. Implications for developing specifications of riders’ and drivers’ assistance systems are discussed.

Consequently, effectively retrieving information from semistructured documents is an important problem that has seen work from both the information retrieval (IR) and databases (DB) communities. Comparing the large number of retrieval models and systems is a non-trivial task for which established benchmark initiatives such as TREC with their focus on unstructured documents are not appropriate. This chapter gives an overview of semistructured data in general and the INEX initiative for the evaluation of XML retrieval, focusing on the most prominent Adhoc Search Track.

AB  - Workload assessment models are an important tool to develop an understanding of an individual’s limitations. Finding times of excess workload can help prevent an individual from continuing work that may result in human performance issues, such as an increase in errors or reaction time. Currently workload assessments are created on a task by task basis, varying drastically depending on sensors and task goals. Developing independent models for specific tasks is time consuming and not practical when being applied to real-world situations. In this experiment we collected physiological signals including electroencephalogram (EEG), Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability (HR/HRV) and Eye-Tracking. Subjects were asked to perform two independent tasks performed at two distinct levels of difficulty, an easy level and a difficult level. We then developed and compared performance of multiple models using deep and shallow learning techniques to determine the best methods to increase generalization of the models across tasks.

Such technologies are the key to realize human-harmonized information systems which can provide us various kinds of supports effectively without distracting our activities. Toward the goal of realizing non-invasive gaze sensing, we developed gaze estimation techniques, which requires very limited or no calibration effort by exploiting various cues such as spontaneous attraction of our visual attention to visual stimuli. For shifting our gaze to desired locations in a non-disturbing and natural way, we exploited two approaches for gaze control: subtle modulation of visual stimuli based on visual saliencyVisual saliencymodels, and non-verbal gestures in human-robot interactions.

CY  - Cham
AB  - People sense the world by exploiting correlations between their physical actions and the changing sensory input that results from those actions. Interfaces that translate non-human sensor data to signals that are compatible with the human senses can therefore augment our abilities to make sense of the world. This insight has recently sparked an increase in projects that explore sensemaking and the creation of novel human experiences across scientific and artistic disciplines. However, there currently exists no constructive dialogue between artists and scientists that conduct research on this topic. In this position paper, we identify the theory and practice of sensory augmentation as a domain that could benefit from such a dialogue. We argue that artistic and scientific methods can complement each other within research on sensory augmentation and identify six thematic starting points for a dialogue between the arts and sciences. We conducted a case study to explore these conjectures, in which we instigated such a dialogue on a small scale. The case study revealed that the six themes we identified as relevant for a dialogue on sensory augmentation emerge rather spontaneously in such a dialogue and that such an exchange may facilitate progress on questions that are central to the theory and practice of sensory augmentation. Overall, this position paper contributes preliminary evidence for the potential of, and a starting point for, a dialogue between the arts and sciences that advances our understanding of sensory augmentation and the development of applications that involve it.

AB  - In situated dialogue, although an artificial agent and its human partner are co-present in a shared environment, they have significantly mismatched capabilities in perceiving the environment. When a shared perceptual basis is broken, referential grounding between partners becomes more challenging. Our hypothesis is that in such a situation, non-verbal modalities such as eye gaze play an important role in coordinating the referential process. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system to simulate mismatched visual perceptions of the shared environment between human partners. Using this system, we further designed experiments to examine how partners with mismatched visual perceptual capabilities collaborate to accomplish joint tasks. Our studies have shown that, partners with mismatched perceptions make more effort to collaborate. When one partner pays attention to the other partner’s naturally occurred eye gaze during interaction, referential grounding becomes more efficient. This paper describes our empirical findings and discusses their potential implications.

AB  - Design fixation is a robust phenomenon that has been shown to affect amateurs, experts, and groups of designers across a variety of design domains. An area of confusion concerning the concept of design fixation is whether it is a conscious decision made by a designer or an unconscious action that occurs without awareness. The current research addresses this issue by utilizing eye tracking as an objective measure, in conjunction with subjective feedback, and design performance data to gain insight into the underlying processes of design fixation. It was found that there are major discrepancies in what people remember looking at, what people actually looked at, and what features designers fixated on. These findings inspire a fount of new research questions, as well as a possible rethinking of current design processes.

VL  - 24
IS  - 1
AB  - Developers spend the majority of their time reading code, a process in which identifier names play a key role. Although many identifier naming styles exist, they often lack an empirical basis and it is not clear whether short or long identifier names facilitate comprehension. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different identifier naming styles (single letters, abbreviations, and words) on program comprehension. We conducted an experimental study with 72 professional C# developers who had to locate defects in source code snippets. We used a within-subjects design, such that each developer worked with all three versions of identifier naming styles, and we measured the time it took them to find a defect. We found that word identifiers led to a 19% increase in speed to find defects compared to meaningless single letters and abbreviations, but we did not find a difference between letters and abbreviations. The results of our study suggest that code is more difficult to comprehend when it contains only letters and abbreviations as identifier names. Words as identifier names facilitate program comprehension and may help to save costs and improve software quality.

JO  - International Journal of Information Security
SP  - 245
EP  - 254
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - The graphical password authentication scheme uses icons instead of text-based passwords to authenticate users. Icons might be somehow more familiar to human beings than text-based passwords, since it is hard to remember the latter with sufficient security strength. No matter what kind of password is used, there are always shoulder-surfing problems. An attacker can easily get text-based password or graphical password by observation, capturing a video or recording the login process. In this paper, we propose a shoulder-surfing-proof graphical password authentication scheme using the convex-hull graphical algorithm. We give evaluation and comparisons to demonstrate the security strength and the functionality advantages of our scheme.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Gestural interfaces are now a familiar mode of user interaction and gestural input is an important part of the way that users can interact with such interfaces. However, entering gestures accurately and efficiently can be challenging. In this paper we present two styles of visual gesture autocompletion for 2D predictive gesture entry. Both styles enable users to abbreviate gestures. We experimentally evaluate and compare both styles of visual autocompletion against each other and against non-predictive gesture entry. The best performing visual autocompletion is referred to as SimpleFlow. Our findings establish that users of SimpleFlow take significant advantage of gesture autocompletion by entering partial gestures rather than whole gestures. Compared to non-predictive gesture entry, users enter partial gestures that are 41% shorter than the complete gestures, while simultaneously improving the accuracy (+13%, from 68% to 81%) and speed (+10%) of their gesture input. The results provide insights into why SimpleFlow leads to significantly enhanced performance, while showing how predictive gestures with simple visual autocompletion impacts upon the gesture abbreviation, accuracy, speed and cognitive load of 2D predictive gesture entry.

AB  - This paper presents an agent architecture designed as part of a multidisciplinary collaboration between embodied agents development and psycho-linguistic experimentation. This collaboration will lead to an empirical study involving an interactive human-like avatar following participants’ gaze. Instead of adapting existing “off the shelf” embodied agents solutions, experimenters and developers collaboratively designed and implemented experiment’s logic and the avatar’s real time behavior from scratch in the Blender environment following an agile methodology. Frequent iterations and short implementation sprints allowed the experimenters to focus on the experiment and test many interaction scenarios in a short time.

The model is part of the design of a cognitive system which comprises an agent that supports a naval officer in its task to compile a tactical picture of the situation in the field. A case study is described in which the model is used to simulate a human subject’s attention. The formal analysis is based on temporal relational specifications for attentional states and for different stages of attentional processes. The model has been automatically verified against these specifications.

AB  - Most available gaze tracking systems based on corneal reflection have low tolerance for head movements. In this paper, an eye-gaze tracking method, which can make this system be adaptive to external lighting changes and to the user’s head movements, is put forward to alleviate the restriction on the user’s head motion. We manage to improve the performance of the algorithm: The thresholds for extraction of the pupil and the corneal reflection are automated; the edge points of the pupil could be obtained by a 1D line search. To improve the resolution and accuracy of the system, the sub-pixel technique is used to locate the feature position accurately in the eye image. We apply a new randomized method of ellipse fitting to the edge points for good results. Our system can work under natural head movements by using only one camera to track eye-gaze. It can run in real time at video rate (25frames/second). A gaze accuracy of 1 degree is observed.

SP  - 409
EP  - 413
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Situation awareness is a perception of the available information, events, resources, and environment within a given time and space. Humans have limited abilities to obtain and maintain situation awareness, as they need to carefully orchestrate the available resources. A failure to maintain situation awareness may lead to serious errors in human behavior. Investigation of the situation awareness of neurosurgeons using cognitive architectures is a new and exciting application of computational user modeling. Accurately modeling of the surgeons’ behavior and their mental states while they perform operations using miniature instruments and movements require various implicit measures of the surgeons’ behavior. The user modeling community has been searching for such data sources in other domains and have indicated that eye-tracking, as a noninvasive methodology, can be used to enrich the user models and increase their quality. In this research I will 1) investigate what are the constituents of situation awareness during neurosurgery, 2) how eye-tracking methodologies fit to created suitable user models of situation awareness, and 3) how data should be processed, and what features of eye-tracking data work best. We propose to use eye tracking techniques to develop a comprehensive computational model of the surgeons’ behavior. The model will be further interpreted, to understand how information, events, and surgeons’ actions will impact neurosurgery operations.

VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - The topic of situation awareness has received continuing interest over the last decades. Freeze-probe methods, such as the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), are commonly employed for measuring situation awareness. The aim of this paper was to review validity issues of the SAGAT and examine whether eye movements are a promising alternative for measuring situation awareness. First, we outlined six problems of freeze-probe methods, such as the fact that freeze-probe methods rely on what the operator has been able to remember and then explicitly recall. We propose an operationalization of situation awareness based on the eye movements of the person in relation to their task environment to circumvent shortfalls of memory mediation and task interruption. Next, we analyzed experimental data in which participants (N = 86) were tasked to observe a display of six dials for about 10 min, and press the space bar if a dial pointer crossed a threshold value. Every 90 s, the screen was blanked and participants had to report the state of the dials on a paper sheet. We assessed correlations of participants’ task performance (% of threshold crossing detected) with visual sampling scores (% of dials glanced at during threshold crossings) and freeze-probe scores. Results showed that the visual-sampling score correlated with task performance at the threshold-crossing level (r = 0.31) and at the individual level (r = 0.78). Freeze-probe scores were low and showed weak associations with task performance. We conclude that the outlined limitations of the SAGAT impede measurement of situation awareness, which can be computed more effectively from eye movement measurements in relation to the state of the task environment. The present findings have practical value, as advances in eye-tracking cameras and ubiquitous computing lessen the need for interruptive tests such as SAGAT. Eye-based situation awareness is a predictor of performance, with the advantage that it is applicable through real-time feedback technologies.

AB  - Navigation in a hierarchical menu on the current smart TVs (STVs) contributes to a poor user experience for older adults. Difficulty with navigation is caused by the design of an interface and users’ mental models. To explore different design possibilities, two types of menu layouts (i.e., mega menus and tiled menus) with tags were designed in this study. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of menu layouts on the user experiences of older adults. A manipulation check of both menu layouts was conducted via eye tracking. To understand users’ mental models, a card sorting method with a path diagram was employed. Thirty older adults were recruited in this experiment. The results indicated that a mega menu can reduce the physical effort of pressing keys, whereas a tiled menu achieves higher satisfaction of older adults. However, the mental model similarity between designers and older adults toward mega menus and tiled menus exhibited no significant difference. Older adults with high spatial ability had mental models that were similar to the mental models of designers.

AB  - A user task is often distributed across devices, e.g., a student listening to a lecture in a classroom while watching slides on a projected screen and making notes on her laptop, and sometimes checking Twitter for comments on her smartphone. In scenarios like this, users move between heterogeneous devices and have to deal with task resumption overhead from both physical and mental perspectives. To address this problem, we created Smooth Gaze, a framework for recording the user’s work state and resuming it seamlessly across devices by leveraging implicit gaze input. In particular, we propose two novel and intuitive techniques, smart watching and smart posting, for detecting which display and target region the user is looking at, and transferring and integrating content across devices respectively. In addition, we designed and implemented a cross-device reading system SmoothReading that captures content from secondary devices and generates annotations based on eye tracking, to be displayed on the primary device. We conducted a study that showed that the system supported information seeking and task resumption, and improved users’ overall reading experience.

AB  - Modeling multimodal face-to-face interaction is a crucial step in the process of building social robots or users-aware Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA). In this context, we present a novel approach for human behavior analysis and generation based on what we called “Incremental Discrete Hidden Markov Model” (IDHMM). Joint multimodal activities of interlocutors are first modeled by a set of DHMMs that are specific to supposed joint cognitive states of the interlocutors. Respecting a task-specific syntax, the IDHMM is then built from these DHMMs and split into i) a recognition model that will determine the most likely sequence of cognitive states given the multimodal activity of the interlocutor, and ii) a generative model that will compute the most likely activity of the speaker given this estimated sequence of cognitive states. Short-Term Viterbi (STV) decoding is used to incrementally recognize and generate behavior. The proposed model is applied to parallel speech and gaze data of interacting dyads.

AB  - Knowledge circulation is indispensable to improving the coverage and quality of knowledge shared in a community. In order for information and communication technologies to be successfully applied to realize knowledge circulation, social aspects need to be considered so that the technologies can be properly embedded into the society. This issue has been addressed in social intelligence design, a field of research aiming at understanding and augmenting social intelligence based on a bilateral definition of social intelligence as an individual’s ability to better live in a social context and a group’s ability to collectively solve problems and learn from experiences. In this paper, based on an overview of social intelligence design research, I present a generic framework of conversational knowledge circulation in which conversation is used as a primary means for communicating knowledge. I present attentive agents, autonomous interaction learner, situated knowledge management, self-organizing incremental memory, immersive conversation environment, as key technologies in conversational quantization for conversational knowledge circulation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Social media has a significant impact in our daily social lives, which challenges the traditional face-to-face interaction and/or other conventional media. Most of the social media platforms provide unique and effective web sites that enable the users to connect and interact with one another yet they also update their sites with Web 2.0 improvements and innovative ways of interaction. Twitter and Facebook have launched their own applications that became really popular among users. However, there are also third-party applications, which enable the use of diverse social networking sites through one platform. These platforms are within the reach of everyone and can be accessed directly from desktop without any browser needed. This research focuses on the usability of these third-party management applications. In this context, it will explore whether the desktop versions (third-party software) of those platforms enhance the interaction capabilities and improve user experience. In this regard the focus will be on an application that enables the use of multiple social media sites simultaneously through a single graphical user interface, ‘Yoono’. The user interaction with multiple accounts and social media services at the same time presents the ability to show the information in one screen rather than having separate tabs like has been done in typical browser view. Also it might be possible to have an estimate about if the user prefers to have separate tabs or just one tab to show all of the information regarding the social media that he/she is using. In order to understand this, a qualitative usability test, based on multi-method approach, was carried out with a sample of 8 participants who were experienced mobile social network site (SNS) users. Tests were conducted on a desktop computer with Yoono. After a background questionnaire, the participants were observed during the task executions and additional data was collected through eye-tracking. After the session, participants were asked to fill out a post-test form while having a small debriefing interview to gain a detailed insight into their experience. Findings support the notion that the usability problems might shroud the new and innovative capabilities of Yoono and prevents it to become an application that users would chose to use instead of browser interaction and needs further development in order to be an alternative to browsing.

AB  - Information technology systems that are meant to facilitate social networking are successful only if they are embedded in the individual activities and social processes of their users. In order to be able to consider these success factors as early as during the development process of information technology, a systematic development methodology is necessary that embraces the interdisciplinary requirements for the social compatibility of technology. But how can these non-functional demands of various scientific disciplines be unified and constructively converted into functional design proposals? The VENUS Development MethodVENUS Development Methodfor a Socially Compatible Technology Design offers a solution to this problem, which is compatible with traditional software development methods. This chapter presents the theoretical foundations and the approach of the method using the design of UC applications as an example.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This work focuses on data-driven discovery of the temporally co-occurring and contingent behavioral patterns that signal high and low interpersonal rapport. We mined a reciprocal peer tutoring corpus reliably annotated for nonverbals like eye gaze and smiles, conversational strategies like self-disclosure and social norm violation, and for rapport (in 30 s thin slices). We then performed a fine-grained investigation of how the temporal profiles of sequences of interlocutor behaviors predict increases and decreases of rapport, and how this rapport management manifests differently in friends and strangers. We validated the discovered behavioral patterns by predicting rapport against our ground truth via a forecasting model involving two-step fusion of learned temporal associated rules. Our framework performs significantly better than a baseline linear regression method that does not encode temporal information among behavioral features. Implications for the understanding of human behavior and social agent design are discussed.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Soft biometric systems have spread among recent years, both for powering classical biometrics, as well as stand alone solutions with several application scopes ranging from digital signage to human-robot interaction. Among all, in the recent years emerged the possibility to consider as a soft biometrics also the temporal evolution of the human gaze and some recent works in the literature explored this exciting research line by using expensive and (perhaps) unsafe devices which, moreover, require user cooperation to be calibrated. By our knowledge the use of a low-cost, non-invasive, safe and calibration-free gaze estimator to get soft-biometrics data has not been investigated yet. This paper fills this gap by analyzing the soft-biometrics performances obtained by modeling the series of gaze estimated by exploiting the combination of head poses and eyes’ pupil locations on data acquired by an off-the-shelf RGB-D device.

AB  - The mining of software archives has enabled new ways for increasing the productivity in software development: Analyzing software quality, mining project evolution, investigating change patterns and evolution trends, mining models for development processes, developing methods of integrating mined data from various historical sources, or analyzing natural language artifacts in software repositories, are examples of research topics. Software repositories include various data, ranging from source control systems, issue tracking systems, artifact repositories such as requirements, design and architectural documentation, to archived communication between project members. Practitioners and researchers have recognized the potential of mining these sources to support the maintenance of software, to improve their design or architecture, and to empirically validate development techniques or processes. We revisited software mining studies that were published in recent years in the top venues of software engineering, such as ICSE, ESEC/FSE, and MSR. In analyzing these software mining studies, we highlight different viewpoints: pursued goals, state-of-the-art approaches, mined artifacts, and study replicability. To analyze the mining artifacts, we (lexically) analyzed research papers of more than a decade. In terms of replicability we looked at existing work in the field in mining approaches, tools, and platforms. We address issues of replicability and reproducibility to shed light onto challenges for large-scale mining studies that would enable a stronger conclusion stability.

AB  - We introduce in this paper the concept of set deviation as a tool to characterize the deviation of a set of strings around its set median. The set deviation is defined as the set median of the positive edit sequences between any string and the set median. We show how the set deviation can be efficiently used in well known statistical estimation and particularly with the minimum volume ellipsoid estimator. This concept is illustrated on several examples and particularly in clustering a set of shapes coded as strings using the Freeman code.

AB  - Transportation problem (TP) is a very important area in operations research and management science. TPs not only involve with cost minimization, but also involve with many other goals such as profit maximization, time minimization, minimization of total deterioration of goods, etc. Also the available data of a transportation system such as transportation costs, resources, demands, conveyance capacities are not always crisp or precise but are uncertain. In this dissertation some transportation problems have been formulated and solved in different uncertain environments, e.g., fuzzy, type-2 fuzzy, rough and linguistic.

AB  - With the advancement both in the Web (e.g., semantic Web and human-level wisdom-Web computing) and in Brain Informatics (BI) (e.g., advanced information technologies for brain science and non-invasive neuroimaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)), several lines of BI research have been developed directly or indirectly related to Web Intelligence (WI). Some of them can be treated as the extension to the Web research of the tradition BI research, such as computational cognitive modeling like ACT-R. ACT-R is a theory and model of computational cognitive architecture which consists of functional modules, such as declarative knowledge module, procedural knowledge module, goal module and input (visual, aural), output (motor, verbal) modules. Information can be proposed parallel inside and among the modules, but has to be sequentially if it needs procedural module to coordinate the behavior across modules. At the International WIC Institute (WICI), we are trying to introduce this kind of architecture and the mechanism of activation of the units in declarative knowledge module into our Web information system. Based on or related to ACT-R, theories and models that are with very close relation to WI have also been developed, such as threaded cognition for concurrent multitasking, cognitive agents, human-Web interaction (e.g., SNIT-ACT (Scentbased navigation and information foraging in the ACT cognitive architecture). At the WICI, we are also working on the user behavior and reasoning on the Web by eye-tracker and fMRI. Some of other BI studies, however, have been developed directly by the requirement of WI research. For example, to meet the requirement of the development of Granular Reasoning (GrR) technologies in WI research, people at the WICI have been checking how human can perceive the real world under many levels of granularity (i.e., abstraction) and can also easily switch among granularities. By focusing on different levels of granularity, one can obtain different levels of knowledge, as well as in-depth understanding of the inherent knowledge structure. The interaction between human intelligence inspired WI methodology research and WI stimulated BI principle research will benefit both BI and WI researches greatly.

BT  - Computer Vision – ECCV 2012
SP  - 84
EP  - 97
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Algorithms using “bag of features”-style video representations currently achieve state-of-the-art performance on action recognition tasks, such as the challenging Hollywood2 benchmark [1,2,3]. These algorithms are based on local spatiotemporal descriptors that can be extracted either sparsely (at interest points) or densely (on regular grids), with dense sampling typically leading to the best performance [1]. Here, we investigate the benefit of space-variant processing of inputs, inspired by attentional mechanisms in the human visual system. We employ saliency-mapping algorithms to find informative regions and descriptors corresponding to these regions are either used exclusively, or are given greater representational weight (additional codebook vectors). This approach is evaluated with three state-of-the-art action recognition algorithms [1,2,3], and using several saliency algorithms. We also use saliency maps derived from human eye movements to probe the limits of the approach. Saliency-based pruning allows up to 70% of descriptors to be discarded, while maintaining high performance on Hollywood2. Meanwhile, pruning of 20-50% (depending on model) can even improve recognition. Further improvements can be obtained by combining representations learned separately on salience-pruned and unpruned descriptor sets. Not surprisingly, using the human eye movement data gives the best mean Average Precision (mAP; 61.9%), providing an upper bound on what is possible with a high-quality saliency map. Even without such external data, the Dense Trajectories model [1] enhanced by automated saliency-based descriptor sampling achieves the best mAP (60.0%) reported on Hollywood2 to date.

AB  - Spatial auditory interfaces use three-dimensional sound as an additional display dimension and consist of audio items at different spatial locations. They have evolved significantly in the last couple of years and can be found in a variety of environments where visual communication is obstructed or completely blocked by other activities, such as walking, driving, flying, operating multimodal virtual displays, etc. The precise spatial position of each source can offer an additional informational cue in the interface or can simply help resolving various ambiguities in the content of simultaneously-played sources. It can also be used to increase realism in virtual worlds by imitating real environments where the majority of sounds can be localized and associated with their sources.

AB  - The topic of dynamic presentation of temporal order information relates to both the node information flowing with time and the location changing in 2D space. In this paper, psychological research methods were applied to research the feasible representation method of temporal order information on the base of human cognitive characteristics. That was the research on relevance of temporal order presentation and space order presentation. We tried to study on the dynamic information presentation processes of the nodes arranged regular in horizontal linear trace. The eye-tracker recorded the performance of 30 valid subjects in different nodes skip way, horizontal moving direction and moving time. Through the analysis of accuracy and reaction time, the conclusion has been drawn that the possible presentation methods with optimal performance.

AB  - For solving tasks cooperatively in close interaction with humans, robots need to have timely updated spatial representations. However, perceptual information about the current position of interaction partners is often late. If robots could anticipate the targets of upcoming manual actions, such as pointing gestures, they would have more time to physically react to human movements and could consider prospective space allocations in their planning.

JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
SP  - 473
EP  - 486
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
AB  - Spatial disorientation (SD) poses a serious threat to flight safety. A pilot’s gaze behaviour that characterizes his/her visual perception and attention determines success in dealing with this phenomenon. Regardless of a pilot’s experience or proficiency, sensory illusions can lead to differences between instrument indications and what the pilot “feels”. Understanding how simulator-induced SD cues affect gaze behaviour in pilots and non-pilots is our interest and was addressed as the aim of this research. Using a SD flight simulator, 40 male (20 military pilots; 20 non-pilots) were exposed to 12 flight sequences. We measured and compared subjects’ gaze behaviour and flight performance in response to three visual and three motion illusions across two groups (pilots vs. non-pilots) and flight type (non-SD vs. SD flight). From the applied SD cues only in three illusions (false horizon, somatogyral, and Coriolis), the difference in visual attention distribution in comparison with non-SD flight was observed. There was no interaction of expertise and flight type. The pilots had shorter mean fixation time than non-pilots, except for landings. For the same SD flight profiles, we found the changes of the subjects’ gaze behaviour and flight performance. The SD cues affect both the pilots and non-pilots in the same way; therefore, being an expert in piloting aircraft does not reduce the susceptibility of the pilot to loss of their spatial orientation. Eye-tracking technology could be useful in the analysis of the pilots’ attention and better understanding and training of pilots’ flight performance during SD events.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Studying and understanding team performance is very important for sports, games, health and any applications that involve a team of users. It is affected by team behaviour or cognition. Usually a team with a good shared cognition can perform better and achieve the set goal faster. Having a good team with a good shared behaviour is even more crucial in health care environments, especially for laprascopic surgery applications. Analyzing team cognition is a new area of research. In this paper, we study the team cognition between two surgeons, who performed a laparascopic simulation operation, by analyzing their eye tracking data spatially and temporally. We used Cross Recurrence Analysis (CRA) and overlap analysis to find spatio-temporal features that can be used to distinguish between a good performer team and a bad performer team. Dual eye tracking data for twenty two dyad teams were recorded during the simulation and then the teams were divided into good performer and poor performer teams based on the time to finish the task. We then analyze the signals to find common features for good performer teams. The results of this research indicates that the good performer teams show a smaller delay as well as have a higher overlap in the eyegaze signals compared to poor performer teams.

AB  - This paper proposes a quantitative model of natural modality integration for speech and pointing gestures. An experiment is described that study temporal synchronization between speech and pointing gestures during multimodal interaction. The end of a pointing gesture (MT) is shown to be synchronized with either the key word of an expression or the deictic marker of a deictic expression. It is also shown that MT tends to be slightly behind the beginning of its associated word; this tendency becoming more marked for lengthy expressions (more than 6 syllables). All correlation scores were found to be above 0.9.

AB  - Aircraft cockpits have substantially increased in complexity over the last 60 years. Whilst the additional instrumentation and systems have improved operational performance and certain aspects of situational awareness, they have also substantially increased the cognitive skills needed of pilots. A pilot interacts with the modern cockpit displays through cursor control devices (CCD), and the implementation and type of CCD has an impact on the quality, performance, and workload experienced by the pilot. This paper highlights the direction of research and development in pilot human-computer interaction (HCI) for both civilian and military aircraft, with regards to CCDs. Particular focus is placed on unconventional interaction methods that are being developed to provide more intuitive, naturally perceptive interfaces. Preliminary work by the authors in contribution to the evaluation of these new input modalities is also briefly presented.

We review existing techniques and then propose a new technique that treats time as the prime attribute to be visualized. We successfully used the new technique for analysing the visual scanning of web search results listings. Based on our experiences, the new visualization is a valuable tool when the temporal order of visiting Areas of Interest (AOI) is the main focus in the analysis, the AOIs have a natural linear order, there are many AOIs to produce interesting patterns, and the AOIs fill most of the coordinate space being studied.

In this chapter, we present and evaluate a statistical method to segment raw keylogging and eye-tracking data into distinct Human Translation Processes (HTPs), i.e., phases of specific human translation behavior, such as orientation, revision, or pause. We evaluate the performance of this automatic method against manual annotation by human experts with a background in Translation Process Research.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Two methods for distinguishing between healthy controls and patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease by means of recorded smooth pursuit eye movements are presented and evaluated. Both methods are based on the principles of stochastic anomaly detection and make use of orthogonal series approximation for probability distribution estimation. The first method relies on the identification of a Wiener model of the smooth pursuit system and attempts to find statistically significant differences between the estimated parameters in healthy controls and patients with Parkinson’s disease. The second method applies the same statistical method to distinguish between the gaze trajectories of healthy and Parkinson subjects tracking visual stimuli. Both methods show promising results, where healthy controls and patients with Parkinson’s disease are effectively separated in terms of the considered metric. The results are preliminary because of the small number of participating test subjects, but they are indicative of the potential of the presented methods as diagnosing or staging tools for Parkinson’s disease.

An experiment is discussed in this paper that was designed to evaluate the efficacy of multimodal sensor measures that have often been used but not yet been systematically tested and compared with each other in previous work, such as pressure distribution sensor, physiological sensors, and an eye tracker. We used the Stroop test and information pick up task as the stressors. In the subject independent case in particular, signals from the combined (chair and floor) pressure distribution sensors, which we consider the most feasible sensors in the office environment, resulted in higher recognition accuracy rates than the physiological or eye tracker signals for the two stressors.

VL  - 76

AB  - Measuring users’ emotional reaction to interactive multimedia and hypermedia is important. One particularly popular self-reported method for emotion assessment is the Valence-Arousal (VA) Scale: a 9 × 9 affective grid. This paper aims to identify specific stress region(s) in the VA space by combining self-reported ratings (pairs of VA) and physiological signals (skin conductance). To this end, 31 healthy volunteers participated in an experiment by performing five stressful interaction tasks while their skin conductance was monitored. The selected interaction tasks were most frequently listed as stressful by a separate group of 15 interviewees. After each task, participants expressed their perceived emotional experience using the VA rating space. Our findings show which regions in the VA rating space may reliably indicate self-reported stress that is in alignment with one’s measured skin conductance while using interactive applications. One additional important contribution of this work is the proposed approach for the empirical identification of affect regions in the VA space based on physiological signals.

AB  - There are many decision-making theories that explain how people decide to buy, click, read, or skip something online. Studies integrating the eye tracking methodology with decision-making processes state many assumptions. Based on a group of assumptions, the current study aims to compare the two search contexts and find if the assumptions are valid for both situations. The simultaneous mixed research methodology led to benefitting from both qualitative and quantitative data. Participants consist of 15 grad/undergrad volunteers from different departments. They were given two scenarios: a hotel search; an academic topic search. They were assigned to decide on the best three options. As they engaged in searching, their eye movements accompanied with think-aloud were recorded. The results indicated a consistency between espoused and enacted academic criteria in addition to the order of importance dimension, but neither of them was observed in everyday context. On the contrary to academic context, eye movements and espoused criterion/criteria were parallel in everyday context. Price and rating were popular criteria for the final decisions, and participants had their own heuristics related to them. Source and content for the academic context were popular, and the participants utilized heuristics, too. The fixations and visits on the popular areas were the maximum ones among others.

AB  - Modern technologies increasingly make use of personal data to provide better services. Technologies using biometric data for identity and authorship verification in the context of e-assessment are a case in point. Previous studies in e-health described a privacy paradox in relation to consent to personal data use: even when people consider protection of their personal data important, they consent fairly readily to personal data use. However, the new European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumes that people give free and informed consent. In the context of e-assessment, this study investigates students’ attitudes towards personal data sharing for identity and authorship verification purposes with the aim of optimising informed consent practice. Students with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) were included as a specific target group because they may feel more dependent on e-assessment. The findings suggest that a privacy paradox exists in the context of e-assessment as well. Furthermore, the results indicate that students are more reluctant to share video recordings of their face than other personal data. Finally, our results confirm the effect found in previous studies on e-health: those feeling a stronger need for technologies, in this case SEND students, are more inclined to consent to personal data use. Implications for informed consent practice are discussed.

As the interface of smart watches delivers more and more information, how to guarantee favorable usability of smart watch interface becomes the focus of designers. Designers need more objectively evaluate the reasonableness of smart watch interface layout and the visibility of interface elements. But traditional evaluation indexes can’t intuitively reflect whether the system structure conforms to the thinking mode of users; and traditional evaluation indexes can’t reveal the strategies employed on interface by users.

AB  - Radar situation interface belongs to a sub-interface of a complex system. Because the information in human-computer interaction interface of a complex system is of a large amount and in complicated relationships, it is apt to cause misreading, misjudgment and information omission in the target search. The critical factors causing error problems like information omission and misjudgment in the radar situation interface are analyzed. Based on the behavioral data and the physiological data derived from eye movement tracking, the misperception factors leading to users’ information omission/misjudgment are detected. The experimental results showed that, (1) Both interval size and vision position impose a significant influence on the visual cognition of target search. The interval should not be too large for target search in the situation interface, otherwise it may result in long reaction time and omission and misjudgment. (2) During the target search in the upper vision, lower vision and peripheral vision, the reaction time and the error rate present significant changes, and the reaction time of peripheral vision achieves the longest. The vision position also exerts a remarkable influence on the first saccade latency. The fixation duration and fixation point number display obvious changes, and the mean fixation duration of the lower vision is the longest while its fixation point number is the smallest, which is apt to cause misjudgment and omission of information. (3) Eye movement plots can effectively reflect the process of information search, and the gaze plot and the heat point map can present the relevant factors of information omission. And the conclusion reached can be used as reference for the information design and layout of the situation interface of future complex system, so as to effectively improve the misperception problems like omission and misjudgment in the target search process.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Teacher orchestration of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) processes plays a major role in students’ outcomes, especially in face-to-face classrooms. However, few studies look into the fine-grained details of how such orchestration unfolds, the challenges and cognitive overload that using technologies at a classroom level pose for teachers. This paper proposes a mixed-method approach to the study of orchestration cognitive load, combining physio-behavioural (eye-tracking) and subjective measurements (questionnaires, stimulated recall interviews). We illustrate the approach by applying it to study the orchestration of two technology-enhanced geometry lessons, by a secondary school teacher. The results of our mixed-method analyses highlight the difficulty of classroom-level (as opposed to individual- or group-level) interactions, especially in modelling students’ progress and understanding. Such insights can be useful in the design of new classroom technologies, and to focus researchers’ attention on critical orchestration episodes during their evaluation.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - One of the greatest challenges in the study of emotions and emotional states is their measurement. The techniques used to measure emotions depend essentially on the authors’ definition of the concept of emotion. Currently, two types of measures are used: subjective and objective. While subjective measures focus on assessing the conscious recognition of one’s own emotions, objective measures allow researchers to quantify and assess the conscious and unconscious emotional processes. In this sense, when the objective is to evaluate the emotional experience from the subjective point of view of an individual in relation to a given event, then subjective measures such as self-report should be used. In addition to this, when the objective is to evaluate the emotional experience at the most unconscious level of processes such as the physiological response, objective measures should be used. There are no better or worse measures, only measures that allow access to the same phenomenon from different points of view. The chapter’s main objective is to make a survey of the main measures of evaluation of the emotions and emotional states more relevant in the current scientific panorama.

AB  - This research effort aims in the estimation of Wood Loss Factor by employing Support Vector Machines. For this purpose experimental data for two different wood species were used. The estimation of the dielectric properties of wood was done by using various Kernel algorithms as a function of both ambient electro-thermal conditions applied during drying of wood and basic wood chemistry. Actually the best fit neural models that were developed in a previous effort of our research team were compared to the Kernels’ approaches in order to determine the optimal ones.

OneCao, Xunimportant service is to provide NNSs with real-time transcripts generated byIshida, Toruautomatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies. The goal of our research is to explore the effects ofYamashita, NaomiASR transcripts on the listening comprehension of NNSs and consider how to support NNSs with ASR transcripts more effectively. To reach our goal, we ran three studies. The first study investigates the comprehension problems faced by NNSs, and the second study examines how ASR transcripts impact their listening comprehension, e.g., what types of comprehension problems could and could not be solved by reading ASR transcripts. Finally, the third study explores the potential of using eye-tracking data to detect their comprehension problems. Our data analysis identified thirteen types of listening comprehension problems. ASR transcripts helped the NNSs solve certain problems, e.g., “failed to recognize words they know.” However, the transcripts did not solve problems such as “lack of vocabulary,” and indeed NNS burden was increased. Results also show that from eye-tracking data we can make reasonably accurate predictions (83.8%) about the types of problems encountered by NNSs. Our findings provide insight into ways of designing real-time adaptive support systems for NNSs.

JO  - Software Quality Journal
SP  - 307
EP  - 340
VL  - 25
IS  - 1
AB  - Developers need to comprehend a program before modifying it. In such cases, developers use cues to establish the relevance of a piece of information with a task. Being familiar with different kinds of cues will help the developers to comprehend a program faster. But unlike the experienced developers, novice developers fail to recognize the relevant cues, because (a) there are many cues and (b) they might be unfamiliar with the artifacts. However, not much is known about the developers’ choice of cue. Hence, we conducted two independent studies to understand the kind of cues used by the developers and how a tool influences their cue selection. First, from our user study on two common comprehension tasks, we found that developers actively seek the cues and their cue source choices are similar but task dependent. In our second exploratory study, we investigated whether an integrated development environment (IDE) influences a developer’s cue choices. By observing their interaction history while fixing bugs in Eclipse IDE, we found that the IDE’s influence on their cue choices was not statistically significant. Finally, as a case in point, we propose a novel task-specific program summarization approach to aid novice developers in comprehending an unfamiliar program. Our approach used developers cue choices to synthesize the summaries. A comparison of the synthesized summaries with the summaries recorded by the developers shows both had similar content. This promising result encourages us to explore task-specific cue models, which can aid novice developers to accomplish complex comprehension tasks faster.

AB  - The correct location of ads, both static and moving, in close proximity of the roadway is an issue of high significance in the context of road safety. This publication aims to provide support in solving these issues by presenting a range of options for the implementation of extensive, multi-faceted research, using modern technology to allow an objective assessment of the risks arising from the presence of advertising spots in the roadway. The chosen research tools include the drivers’ reaction tracking systems based on the use of advanced multimedia technology. These systems may be integrated in the actual vehicle, allowing for performing the tests in real-life conditions or as part of an extended driving simulator. In addition, a part of the proposed approaches to researching the problem is to check drivers’ opinion using questionnaires and to analyze the traffic accidents taking place in close proximity to road advertising.

AB  - Modern symbiotic and adaptive HCI paradigms include real-time algorithms capable of inferring user’s states. We present an experimental interface which aims to understand the information processing capacity of a human user and use this information to improve interaction in a database exploration task. We collected the electrodermal activity and pupillometry signals in tasks of increasing difficulty and used their features to infer whether the subject was performing the task correctly or not. By combining principal component analysis and logistic regression methods, we successfully inferred the accuracy of users’ responses from the signal after the response was made. This study provides a quantitative framework for modelling user internal states and evaluates it in a practical human computer interaction task.

SP  - 211
EP  - 238
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The present work investigates the relationship between syntactic variation and priming in translation. It is based on the claim that languages share a common cognitive network of neural activity. When the source and target languages are solicited in a translation context, this shared network can lead to facilitation effects, so-called priming effects. We suggest that priming is a default setting in translation, a special case of language use where source and target languages are constantly co-activated. Such priming effects are not restricted to lexical elements, but do also occur on the syntactic level. We tested these hypotheses with translation data from the TPR database, more specifically for three language pairs (English-German, English-Danish, and English-Spanish). Our results show that response times are shorter when syntactic structures are shared. The model explains this through strongly co-activated network activity, which triggers a priming effect.

BT  - PRICAI 2012: Trends in Artificial Intelligence
SP  - 312
EP  - 323
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Depending on the reading objective or task, text portions with certain linguistic features require more user attention to maximize the level of understanding. The goal is to build a predictor of these text areas. Our strategy consists in synthesizing image representations of linguistic features, that allows us to use natural language processing techniques while preserving the topology of the text. Eye-tracking technology allows us to precisely observe the identity of fixated words on a screen and their fixation duration. Then, we estimate the scaling factors of a linear combination of image representations of linguistic features that best explain certain gaze evidence, which leads us to a quantification of the influence of linguistic features in reading behavior. Finally, we can compute saliency maps that contain a prediction of the most interesting or cognitive demanding areas along the text. We achieve an important prediction accuracy of the text areas that require more attention for users to maximize their understanding in certain reading tasks, suggesting that linguistic features are good signals for prediction.

AB  - Adaptive human–computer interfaces (HCIs) are fundamental to designing adaptive websites and adaptive decision support systems. Integrating these intelligent systems with modern eye trackers provides more effective ways to exploit eye fixation data and offers improved services to users. We develop an exemplar-based classifier using the tabu search algorithm to predict which decision strategy may underlie an empirical search behavior. Our algorithm reduces the size of decision concept representations to find the best exemplars for each concept. Experimental results show that our classifier is highly accurate in classifying the sequence of empirical eye fixations, demonstrating the promise of integrating adaptive HCIs with modern eye trackers.

AB  - A study is presented, exploring the use of a tactile acoustic device (TAD); which presents full spectrum sound to participants through skin contact, to help increase alertness and reduce tiredness due to boredom during prolonged attentional tasks such as driving long distances. After a literature review on the background to sleepiness, an account is given of a pilot experiment looking at the effectiveness of the Tactile Audio Stimulation on wakefulness in a non-driving scenario. This was conducted, using a Stroop test to simulate the attention demands during long, boring task periods. The test results suggest that a TAD could potentially reduce fatigue during prolonged attentional tasks without compromising performance or increasing distraction. Results revealed that participants reported feeling significantly more alert and had higher KSS ratings after TAD condition then they did following the Music or Control conditions. The next stage experiments will proceed to a driving task with secondary distraction.

AB  - Tag clouds have been utilized as a “social” way to find and visualize information, providing both one-click access and a snapshot of the “aboutness” of a tagged collection. While many research projects have explored and compared various tag artifacts using information theory and simulations, fewer studies have been conducted to compare the effectiveness of different tag-based browsing interfaces from the user’s point of view. This research aims to investigate how users utilize tags in image search context and to what extent different organizations of tag browsing interfaces are useful for image search. We conducted two experiments to explore user behavior and performance with three interfaces: two tag-enabled interfaces (the regular and faceted tag-clouds) and a baseline (search-only) interface. Our results demonstrate the value of tags in the image search context, the role of tags in the exploratory search, and the strengths of two kinds of tag organization explored in this paper.

SP  - 48
EP  - 65
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Mental workload is a complex construct that may be indirectly inferred from physiological responses, as well as subjective and performance ratings. Since the three measures should reflect changes in task-load, one would expect convergence, yet divergence between the measures has been reported. A potential explanation could be related to the differential sensitivity of mental workload measures to rates of change in task-load transitions: some measures might be more sensitive to change than the absolute level of task demand. The present study aims to investigate whether this fact could explain certain divergences between mental workload measures. This was tested by manipulating task-load transitions and its rate of change over time during a monitoring experiment and by collecting data on physiological, subjective, and performance measures. The results showed higher pupil size and performance measure sensitivity to abrupt task-load increases: sensitivity to rates of change could partially explain mental workload dissociations and insensitivities between measures.

AB  - Information visualization systems have traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all paradigm with respect to their users, i.e., their design is seldom personalized to the specific characteristics of users (e.g. perceptual abilities) or their tasks (e.g. task difficulty). In view of creating information visualization systems that can adapt to each individual user and task, this paper provides an analysis of user eye gaze data aimed at identifying behavioral patterns that are specific to certain user and task groups. In particular, the paper leverages the sequential nature of user eye gaze patterns through differential sequence mining, and successfully identifies a number of pattern differences that could be leveraged by adaptive information visualization systems in order to automatically identify (and consequently adapt to) different user and task characteristics.

Particularly, self-declared attractions are confronted with the contents visualized during navigation, thus making possible to understand to what extent the exposure to certain themes influence preferences towards certain attractions. Results from this comparison suggest that contents that teenagers pay attention to during navigation are not always what they declare to prefer as tourist attraction.

AB  - Awareness is the knowledge about present and past group’s activities and it is a relevant issue for cooperative work. There are many devices that supply awareness information in synchronous collaborative editing systems. However, the current awareness devices have restrictions to both accomplish effective awareness and show the focus of attention identifying the exact place of the participants’ attention. This paper presents an awareness widget for synchronous collaborative editing systems called TeleEye that provides information about the localization of the participants’ attention during a collaborative session by means of eye tracking.

AB  - This paper presents a technical approach for temporal symbol integration aimed to be generally applicable in unimodal and multimodal user interfaces. It draws its strength from symbolic data representation and an underlying rule-based system, and is embedded in a multiagent system. The core method for temporal integration is motivated by findings from cognitive science research. We discuss its application for a gesture recognition task and speech-gesture integration in a Virtual Construction scenario. Finally an outlook of an empirical evaluation is given.

AB  - Who has not watched ripples spread across a pool and known water thereby? Or seen leaves shimmer their silver backs in a summer breeze and known a tree? Who has not known the butterfly by her fluttering? Or seen a distant figure walking and known there goes a man? The motion recognition ability of the human visual system is remarkable. People are able to distinguish both highly structured motions, such as those produced by walking, running, swimming or flying birds, and more statistical patterns such as those due to blowing snow, flowing water or fluttering leaves. We have demonstrated similar recognition capabilities in an automated machine vision system using efficient low-level techniques that can be implemented in real-time.

AB  - This study investigates the readability of web sites for users with dyslexia as well as neuro-typical readers. The aim of the paper is twofold: on the one hand, it is aimed at assessing whether and how we can improve the level of web pages accessibility for users with dyslexia, and to determine which new requisites could be added to the current ones proposed from the WCAG guidelines for web accessibility. In order to achieve this goal, we designed a test targeted to students diagnosed with dyslexia (N = 26). Results showed that further modifications to the page style beyond those considered by WCAG (e.g., font type, size and column width) were appreciated by users with dyslexia and may be considered as additional personalization options for this kind of users. On the other hand, we would like to discover if the exploitation of a specific font designed for users with dyslexia would be also welcomed by neuro-typical users in reading tasks. The results of a second on line experiment highlight that neuro-typical users (N = 199) and users with dyslexia (N = 30) prefer this font for reading tasks, compared to a regular sans-serif font.

AB  - The availability of consumer-ready Virtual Reality (VR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has resulted in a surge in VR applications. It has also prompted the design and development of numerous text entry techniques for the paradigm. However, it is difficult to understand the mechanism of these techniques and extract meaningful average performance data from this body of work since they were evaluated in diverse experiment conditions and report different performance metrics. To remedy this, this paper classifies the existing text entry techniques for VR based on their input mechanism and discusses their strengths, limitations, and performance.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Cognitive load is a major factor affecting user performance. Hence, a better understanding of cognitive load can help design better information systems. To achieve this goal, in this study we looked at the relationship between cognitive load and pupillary responses for a task that required people to either read a text passage from an actual website or read the simplified version of the same text passage. The simplified text passage was constructed in a way to assure reduced cognitive load, that is, to facilitate communication of textual information in a way that it can be read and understood easily and quickly. In our previous study, we showed that by applying a set of plain language standards (PLS) to online passages we can simplify the passages in a way that they induce less cognitive demand and hence can improve performance. In this study, we extended our research by investigating time series analysis of eye-movement (pupil dilation) as a proxy for measuring cognitive load during reading these passages. To this end, we conducted an exploratory analysis in order to understand how text simplification, which was used to reduce cognitive load during reading, affected pupil dilation over time. Our results show that text simplification had a significant impact on pupil dilation and that it affected pupil dilation differently at different reading intervals. Additionally, our results show that examining pupil dilation during fixations and saccades separately can provide new insights for understating cognitive load.

AB  - Research provides ample evidence of the impact web page design has on comprehension; and that Generation Y users are impatient and dislike reading text. Yet there has been little research that focuses on content, in particular to examine the impact of text simplification on younger users’ processing of textual information. To address this need, we report the initial steps of a larger research effort that focuses on developing a set of guidelines for designing simple and effective text passages. Specifically, we compiled a set of existing plain language rules and tested its effectiveness of conveying information to Generation Y users. The results suggest the compiled set of rules can serve as an appropriate tool for designing textual passages to reduce cognitive effort and improve readability of textual content for Generation Y users. Also, the results show that eye tracking serves as an excellent objective measurement for examining the effectiveness of text simplification.

AB  - One important user-oriented facet of digital video retrieval research involves how to abstract and display digital video surrogates. This study reports on an investigation of digital video results pages that use textual and visual surrogates. Twelve subjects selected relevant video records from results lists containing titles, descriptions, and three keyframes for ten different search tasks. All subjects were eye-tracked to determine where, when, and how long they looked at text and image surrogates. Participants looked at and fixated on titles and descriptions statistically reliably more than on the images. Most people used the text as an anchor from which to make judgments about the search results and the images as confirmatory evidence for their selections. No differences were found whether the layout presented text or images in left to right order.

AB  - Statistical graphs are images that display quantitative information in a visual format that allows for the easy and consistent interpretation of the information. Often, statistical graphs are in the form of line graphs or bar graphs. In fields, such as cybersecurity, sets of statistical graphs are used to present complex information; however, the interpretation of these more complex graphs is often not obvious. Unless the viewer has been trained to understand each graph used, the interpretation of the data may be limited or incomplete [1]. In order to study the perception of statistical graphs, we tracked users’ eyes while studying simple statistical graphs. Participants studied a graph, and later viewed a graph purporting to be a subset of the data. They were asked to look for a substantive change in the meaning of the second graph compared to the first.

SP  - 36

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Collaborative problem solving is a core ability that has been highly valued in recent years. Collaborative problem solving activities allow learners develop collaboration skills. In science education, collaborative learning with simulations enables learners to manipulate a science problem to explore scientific concepts. However, the collaboration during such a learning context is a complicated process and researchers face difficulties in understanding learners’ mental effort in using the simulations. The use of dual eye-tracking techniques is helpful to uncover learners’ visual attention, and thus to better analyze student collaboration in activities. In this paper, the research focus on learners’ difficulties when they learn together with the simulation in different places. The results show that the techniques are helpful to identify the subtle interaction problem including the problem of lacking coordination, the process misunderstanding problem, and misunderstanding in partners’ attention. Educators may need to address these problems when simulations are applied to support remote collaborative science learning.

BT  - Human-Computer Interaction. Recognition and Interaction Technologies
SP  - 332
EP  - 347
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This paper investigates whether a frequency-domain model of complexity can accurately predict human visual salience maps. The Sencogi model uses the frequency domain to calculate maps of spatial (i.e., static) and temporal (i.e., dynamic) complexity. This study compares the complexity maps generated by Sencogi to human fixation maps obtained during a visual quality assessment task on static images. This work is the first part of an ongoing multi-step study designed to assess whether fixation maps are an accurate representation of saliency for spatio-temporal scenes. A supporting experiment confirmed that top-down factors, such as scene type, task or emotional states, did not affect human fixation maps. Results show that the Sencogi visual complexity model estimates human eye fixations of images with prediction scores that are significantly above a Chance baseline and is able to compete with a Single Observer baseline. We conclude that the Sencogi visual complexity model is able to predict human fixations in the spatial domain. The next studies will focus on the assessment of Sencogi’s performance predicting visual fixations in the spatio-temporal domain.

AB  - An often-heard complaint about hearing aids is that their amplification of environmental noise makes it difficult for users to focus on one particular speaker. In this paper, we present a new prototype Attentive Hearing Aid (AHA) based on ViewPointer, a wearable calibration-free eye tracker. With AHA, users need only look at the person they are listening to, to amplify that voice in their hearing aid. We present a preliminary evaluation of the use of eye input by hearing impaired users for switching between simultaneous speakers. We compared eye input with manual source selection through pointing and remote control buttons. Results show eye input was 73% faster than selection by pointing and 58% faster than button selection. In terms of recall of the material presented, eye input performed 80% better than traditional hearing aids, 54% better than buttons, and 37% better than pointing. Participants rated eye input as highest in the “easiest”, “most natural”, and “best overall” categories.

AB  - BCI hackathons are fun, collaborative activities during which teams develop and implement new BCI designs and projects. BCI hackathons have often involved artistic expression, and have led to new headwear designs and BCI systems that let users paint, make music, or play games via thought alone. In the past few years, the number of BCI hackathons worldwide has increased considerably, and we expect this trend will continue. Here, we provide an overview of BCI hackathons, then review our BR4IN.IO hackathon series. We have hosted a dozen BR4IN.IO hackathons so far, which have included programming, design, flagship, and kids’ projects. At each BR4IN.IO hackathon, we provide hardware, software, and furniture for each team. Teams then have 24 intensive hours of hacking, then present their projects to a jury that decides on the winners. Like most other BCI hackathons, the BR4IN.IO hackathons have helped to teach thousands of new people about BCIs and related neurotechnologies while encouraging positive publicity for our field. In addition to increasing in number, we believe that future BCI hackathons will also entail more advanced hardware and software for hackers, a broader range of devices, new cooperation with different professional entities, more publicity, greater integration with university courses, and other improvements.

Starting from some background assumptions suggested by eye-tracking human subjects, we formulate a Bayesian model of drawing activity. The resulting graphical model is shaped in the form of a Dynamic Bayesian Network that combines features of both the Input–Output Hidden Markov Model and the Coupled Hidden Markov Model, and provides an interesting insight on mechanisms for dynamic integration of visual and proprioceptive information.

Most of these features are associated with subjective perceptions that are tacit and difficult to externalize and translate into a form intelligible to a computer system. Addressing this issue entails important mechanisms underlying social and affective interactive processes and computational tools that support such processes. In relation to presence, for example, the potential of computational and visual artifacts lie in using emotional responses and expressions to support both agent–human interaction as well as computer-mediated human–human interaction.

AB  - Using virtual models of a real environment to improve performance and design effective and efficient user interfaces has always been a matter of choice to provide control of complex environments. The concept of Dual Reality has gone one step further in synchronizing a real environment with its virtualization. So far, little is known about the design of effective Dual Reality interfaces. With this paper we want to shed light on this topic by comparing the strategies, performance and efficiency in a real, virtualized and a DR setting given a complex task. We propose a cost and efficiency measure for complex tasks, and have conducted an experiment based on a complex shelf planning task. Our results show that for certain tasks interacting with the virtual world yields better results, whereas the best effectivity can be observed in a Dual Reality setup. We discuss these results and present design guidelines for future Dual Reality interfaces.

BT  - Human Mental Workload: Models and Applications
SP  - 222

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Manifestations of increasing mental demands may be related to the task’s context. Additionally, to fundamental physiological changes, the workload may be also characterized sometimes by contextual task-related elements. We aimed to investigate the workload of helicopter pilots and develop predictive models related to the tasks’ context. Eight pilots completed an unknown case-scenario (~1 h) in a helicopter simulator. The scenario included changing mission during flight and receiving/transferring an injured subject to the near hospital. We selected interesting scenario’s periods/“tasks” (e.g., searching hospital, urgent landing) where pilots gave oral evaluations (0–100). Performed tasks had various contexts. We developed a multitasking learning approach to “pool together” all tasks because some of them, although different, may carry useful information about others, so they should neither be merged nor be processed totally independently. Interestingly, it seems that physiological and contextual parameters change order of descriptive power, depending on the task.

AB  - A new immersion acrophobia adjuvant therapy system (IAATS) was designed by us to help people with acrophobia escape the fear of heights. We built a realistic virtual scene, in which patients receive Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). Scenes of different heights are available to offer patients with different levels of stimulation. Patients can get continuous progress and corresponding feedback in the system. During the patient’s treatment, we collected the patient’s eye movement data and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data through certain algorithms and different external hardware devices. These two data are involved in Altitude layering agreement we designed to form a more reasonable treatment strategy. They can also be saved and further analyzed after the treatment. The effectiveness of the whole system still needs further experimental exploration.

AB  - Today’s software systems and especially graphical user interfaces are mostly designed to fit to the needs of an ideal target audience – most often purely focusing on young, physically and mentally healthy persons. Not even the development of tailored (e.g. to elderly people) user interfaces but also the testing is a challenging task, because a large set of test persons suffering from specific impairments needs to be recruited which in practice often is unfeasible and the reason for statistically insignificant results. But software systems and their graphical user interfaces have to be designed to cope with the special needs of also handicapped persons. In this paper we introduce a method to support the target oriented design process and evaluation of such graphical user interfaces by simulating specific disabilities and typical impairments. Therefore we emulate the influences of such impairments on the performance while using any graphical user interfaces by applying specific filter algorithms on the target interface. This enables evaluations of the GUI under realistic conditions without being forced to actually involve real impaired participants.

SP  - 185
EP  - 233
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Over recent years, the use of computer-based (and Web-based) learning has become increasingly popular. Various E-Learning systems have been developed to provide users with the opportunity to access large quantities of data, often remotely, be part of electronic courses and enjoy facilitations that once could only be part of a traditional classroom, such as communication with other students, or the teacher. However, in many cases, the information in those systems is uniformly presented to all learners, neglecting any potential particularities driven by their human nature like cognitive abilities, learning style, perceptions and affective states. In this respect, research has concentrated on creating E-Learning environments that would integrate existing theories regarding individual differences in such a way as to maximize learning performance through adaptive presentation and navigation support. The personalization factor acts as a barometer to the design quality of such systems and interfaces that positively influence the learning process, academic performance, and satisfaction of learners. In this chapter, we propose a number of human-centred design guidelines for adaptive E-Learning systems that could be considered by researchers and educators in order to create more effective and efficient personalization methods and adaptivity rules to increase the students’ learning experience and comprehension capabilities while interacting with a system.

AB  - This study aims to examine users’ eye movement patterns and their attention to the banner of a Turkish government website. The website was redesigned as two versions in a way that the banner was located on the left (the original site) in one version and on the right in the other version. 14 university students with 9 male and 5 female participated to the study. The heat maps were examined as well as eye movement patterns while performing the given tasks. Results of the study revealed that the banner (including a picture of the head of a public institution) was not directly focused in both groups during the task completion process. Although nearly half of the participants recalled the place of the banner correctly, none of the participants remembered any information about the institution head such as name, picture or social media information.

AB  - Despite technological advances in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in recent years, 3D visualization of the operative field still remains one of greatest challenges. In this paper, the effect of three visualization techniques including conventional 2D, 2D with enhanced depth cue based on shadow, and active 3D displays for novices with no prior adaptation to laparoscopic visualization techniques has been analyzed. A wavelet based paradigm is proposed which offer important insights into the effect of depth perception and visual-motor compensation when performing MIS instrument maneuvers. The proposed method has shown to be advantageous over conventional end-point methods of laparoscopic performance assessment as important supplementary information can be derived from the same trajectories where conventional measures fail to show significant differences.

BT  - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics
SP  - 174
EP  - 182
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - It has been reported that the increase in driving speed incurs a shortened pupil distance, termed as a visual tunneling phenomenon. However, our experimental investigation shows that the effect of driving speed on driver’s visual attention should be understood in terms of the maximum field of view that can balance against the maximum amount of visual information a driver can take/handle against. More specifically, our experimentation shows the following: For the sake of ensuring safety, drivers tend naturally to take as much visual information as possible, should it be allowed in terms of the maximum amount of visual information they can take/handle. However, the maximum visual information a driver can take/handle is different among individuals according to their level of driving expertise. Since the increase of driving speed increases the amount of visual information to process, a driver may be able to expand their field of view only up to the point where the amount of visual information to process balances the maximum amount he/she can take/handle. Beyond this point, the increased anxiety stress may even further reduce the maximum visual information a driver can take/handle, thus further diminishing the field of view, leading to a tunneling effect.

PB  - Springer International Publishing

AB  - Little is known about how dyslexia affects online information seeking. This study addresses the search performance of 21 users with dyslexia and 21 controls in textual versus visual displays. The aim was to investigate whether visual content enhance search performance. Participants were presented with 24 icons and 24 words and asked to locate a target item. Eye-tracking data revealed no differences in performance in visual or textual content in the dyslexia group. There were no significant differences between the user groups on visual tasks. However, users with dyslexia performed significantly slower on textual tasks than controls, mainly due to longer fixation durations. Users in the control group took much less time solving textual tasks than visual tasks. The results indicate that there may be no advantages in replacing textual content with icons for users with dyslexia. However, replacing text with icons may be counterproductive for users without dyslexia.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - This study investigates the influence of the speech quality of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) on users’ perception, behavior and emotions. Twenty-four subjects interacted in a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) setup with two ECAs in two scenarios of a virtual theater partner application. In both scenarios, each ECA had three different speech qualities: natural, high-quality synthetic and low-quality synthetic. Eye gaze data show that subjects’ visual attention was not influenced by ECA’s speech quality, but by their look. On the other hand, subjects’ self-report of emotions and verbal descriptions of their perceptions were influenced by ECAs’ speech quality. Finally, Galvanic Skin Response data were neither influenced by ECAs’ look, nor by their speech quality. These results stress the importance of the correct matching of the auditory and visual modalities of ECAs and give methodological insights for the assessment of user’s perception, behavior and emotions when interacting with virtual characters.

AB  - In this chapter, we develop hypotheses that rule linking can improve process model understanding accuracy, time efficiency, and reduce mental effort. Then we present our experiment investigating the effect of rule linking, a specific rule integration approach which uses graphical links to connect process model symbols with rules, on process model understanding. Our objective is two-fold. First, we test if linked rules can improve a model user’s understanding of business process and rules. Second, by using eye-tracking technology in the experiment, we break down the statistics to the Process Model Area, Rule Area and Question Area and see what kind of information (process model, or rules) contributes most to our hypotheses. Third, we investigate the differences between other aspects of human cognitive behaviour such as single visit time and attention switching between groups, further exploring whether linked rules can improve process model understanding.

AB  - Consulting external resources is an important aspect of the translation process. Whereas most previous studies were limited to screen capture software to analyze the usage of external resources, we present a more convenient way to capture this data, by combining the functionalities of CASMACAT with those of Inputlog, two state-of-the-art logging tools. We used this data to compare the types of resources used and the time spent in external resources for 40 from-scratch translation sessions (HT) and 40 post-editing (PE) sessions of 10 master’s students of translation (from English into Dutch). We took a closer look at the effect of the usage of external resources on productivity and quality of the final product. The types of resources consulted were comparable for HT and PE, but more time was spent in external resources when translating. Though search strategies seemed to be more successful when translating than when post-editing, the quality of the final product was comparable, and post-editing was faster than regular translation.

EP  - 221
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Co-adapted learning involves complex, dynamically unfolding interactions between human and artificial pedagogical agents (PAs) during learning with intelligent systems. In general, these interactions lead to effective learning when (1) learners correctly monitor and regulate their cognitive and metacognitive processes in response to internal (e.g., accurate metacognitive judgments followed by the selection of effective learning strategies) and external (e.g., response to agents’ prompting and feedback) conditions, and (2) pedagogical agents can adequately and correctly detect, track, model, and foster learners’ self-regulatory processes. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of PAs’ prompting and feedback on learners’ self-regulated learning about the human circulatory system with MetaTutor, an adaptive, multi-agent learning environment. Sixty-nine (N=69) undergraduates learned about the topic with MetaTutor, during a 2-hour session under one of three conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), prompt-only (PO), and no prompt (NP) condition. The PF condition received timely prompts from several pedagogical agents to deploy various SRL processes and received immediate directive feedback concerning the deployment of the processes. The PO condition received the same timely prompts, without feedback. Finally, the NP condition learned without assistance from the agents. Results indicate that those in the PF condition had significantly higher learning efficiency scores than those in both the PO and control conditions. In addition, log-file data provided evidence of the effectiveness of the PA’s timely scaffolding and feedback in facilitating learners’ (in the PF condition) metacognitive monitoring and regulation during learning.

AB  - The error prevention effects of “point and call checks (P&C Checks)” are known and used in several industries in Japan. We investigated whether or not “pointing” had an error prevention effect and if the effect is due to eye focusing. Participants performed tasks under different experimental conditions: (1) with pointing, (2) without pointing. The density of the dots were controlled (high or low). This task had two subtasks. One, focusing on the only target dots and two, remembering the dots which have been counted. The result indicated that only in low density condition the number of counting error in “with pointing” conditions was significantly fewer than that in “without pointing” condition. The result supported the memory enhancing effect of pointing.

AB  - Current research investigates the limitation of current cockpit design for Crew Alerting System (CAS) and Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), and proposes a potential design solution that might enhance crew performance. Using eye tracking device, an experiment was conducted based on Flight Simulator Software. Objective eye movement data as long as subjective feedback from participants were collected to evaluate the design. 24 participants experienced 4 scenarios with both traditional design and integrated design. Results demonstrated that participants never made error in locating the instructions by integrated design. It is due to the obvious fact that the instructions of integrated design will present itself, hence decrease the chance of executing the wrong NNC by eliminating the degree of choices. On the other hand, 75% of the participants experienced at least one error in finding the correct instruction, which is probably due to the limitation of QRH itself due to options too close in formatting which causes clicking the wrong page accidently. Furthermore, a trend was identified by eye movement patterns for longer fixation duration, smaller saccade amplitude, and less time fixated on instruction area occur in integrated design. Current research found that integrated design of CAS and QRH is superior in acquiring accurate solutions for emergent situations and processing the information presented compared with traditional design.

AB  - Current research investigates automation feedback design compared with a potential design solution that may increase pilot’s situation awareness of the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMAs) to reduce pilot workload and improve human-automation coordination. The research tools include an Eye Tracker and B747 flight simulator. This research evaluated two types of FMAs; a proposed glareshield mounted FMAs against the baseline FMA design mounted on the Primary Flight Display using an objective eye tracker. There are 19 participants including professional and private pilots and aerospace engineers. The results suggest that proposed glareshield design is the better design compared with the baseline design which demonstrated larger mean pupil sizes related to the higher workload. A design solution was proposed that moved the FMAs to a MCP position, taking into account EASA and FAA design guidance, as well as several design principles including positioning to increase salience and the proximity compatibility principle. The results of the experiment found that FMAs on the MCP could increase pilot SA and reduced the mean fixation duration compared to the PFD position. Although the study used a small sample size, it demonstrates the value of further research to evaluate the proposed design.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - In the last couple of years, the interest in remote tower operation systems has increased, as a concept to provide cost-efficient air traffic control service to airports. Attempts are made to stretch the concept to enable multiple remote tower control. A couple of challenges have been identified that need to be mitigated to make the concept feasible. For instance, studies revealed the disadvantage of reduced quality of the video panorama and an increased dispersion of information gathering. Design concepts were derived from the top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of human information processing to support multiple remote tower. These concepts could potentially mitigate the negative effects of a reduced quality of the video panorama and also the dispersion of information gathering. This paper focusses on the reduced quality of the video panorama and uses these design concepts to implement three visual assistance systems. These systems were tested within a laboratory experiment with 40 participants for effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, situation awareness, and workload. The microworld FAirControl was used to simulate an air traffic control monitoring task at a single airport. First, the visual assistance systems were compared against the baseline to assess the improvement of each system. Second, in an explorative approach, the visual assistance systems were compared to identify the advantages and disadvantages against each other. The results show that visual assistance systems can mitigate the influence of the quality-reduced video panorama. The results also indicate that usability of the visual assistance systems is crucial. Participant selective information overlay had the best overall performance.

AB  - Ballot layout and the incorporation of assistive technologies into voting systems are plagued with inconsistencies across the United States. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both ballot layout display configuration (information density) and a variety of controllers (e.g., mouse, 2- or 5-button controller) in order to assess performance and preference among voters. Participants were presented with three mock ballots, each with different layouts (scrollable pages, multiple columns or multiple pages per contest). Eye-tracking data and selection time data were recorded and a usability questionnaire was administered after each testing condition. The results of the study found that participants preferred the multiple column display configuration and the use of the mouse. The results from this study will be leveraged to design an iPad Voting Application with appropriate interfaces and controls. This will allow individuals with disabilities the opportunity to vote without requiring the dexterity to use a paper and pencil ballot.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to do experimental research of task load quantitative analysis based on the pupil diameter. Two sets of experiments were designed from several task elements: (1) Visual Tracking, Visual - Cognitive, Visual - Cognitive – Response; (2) Auditory-Cognitive, Auditory - Cognitive - Respond. In the experiment, the pupil diameter was obtained by eye tracker. From the experimental results, the change of pupil size in visual tracking exper-iment is the same as in visual cognition experiment, which can indicate the load of these two tasks being the same. The increasing size of the pupil diameter aroused by task of responding, in the experiments of Visual-Cognitive-Respond and Auditory-Cognitive-Respond, is also in the same. The results showed that pupil diameter can be used as the index for task load quantitative analysis.

To validate the concept, we present results from an eye tracking study of four common tasks on three different Web portals. The findings show a consistent search geometry that describes eye behaviour across the different sites and tasks. The geometry illustrates that a small set of page regions account for a large proportion of eye movements. The results are briefly discussed in relation to theories of information foraging and information scent.

AB  - Text simplification is the process of transforming a text into an equivalent which is easier to read and to understand, preserving its meaning for a target population. One such population who could benefit from text simplification are people with dyslexia. One of the alternatives for text simplification is the use of verbal paraphrases. One of the more common verbal paraphrase pairs are the one composed by a lexical verb (to hug) and by a support verb plus a noun collocation (to give a hug). This paper explores how Spanish verbal paraphrases impact the readability and the comprehension of people with and without dyslexia dyslexia. For the selection of pairs of verbal paraphrases we have used the Badele.3000 database, a linguistic resource composed of more than 3,600 verbal paraphrases. To measure the impact in reading performance and understandability, we performed an eye-tracking study including comprehension questionnaires. The study is based on a group of 46 participants, 23 with confirmed dyslexia and 23 control group. We did not find significant effects, thus tools that can perform this kind of paraphrases automatically might not have a large effect on people with dyslexia. Therefore, other kinds of text simplification might be needed to benefit readability and understandability of people with dyslexia.

AB  - This paper addresses the role of self-efficacy in human-computer-interaction (HCI) and examines whether there are gender differences in computer performance. This research study is part of the interdisciplinary doctoral program “Gendered Configurations of Humans and Machines. Interdisciplinary Analyses of Technology,” funded by the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany and conducted by the Braunschweig University of Technology, Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences and Braunschweig University of Art. This research project aims to analyze usage contexts, expectations, and behavior in the field of information technology with regard to gender aspects. In order to investigate and identify the key gender variables affecting performance and subjective perception during interaction with a human-computer interface, an empirical study with 30 participants was designed and carried out at the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Fifteen female and 15 male participants, aged 21–63, with different educational, social, migration, and cultural backgrounds were asked to perform three different tasks with an unfamiliar software. The participants wore an eye tracker during task processing. Our extended qualitative and quantitative research aggregated a series of potential gender differences. The results showed that there are gender differences in computer performance. Female users aged 35–64 had lower self-efficacy than male users. They were less persistent when a task became challenging and showed a tendency to attribute failure at a task to their own lack of capability, whereas male users attributed this to the difficulty of the task.

CY  - Cham
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the relationship between students’ (N = 28) individual differences and visual attention to pedagogical agents (PAs) during learning with MetaTutor, a hypermedia-based intelligent tutoring systems. We used eye tracking to capture visual attention to the PAs, and our results reveal specific visual attention-related metrics (e.g., fixation rate, longest fixations) that are significantly influenced by learning depending on student achievement goals. Specifically, performance-oriented students learned more with a long longest fixation and a high fixation rate on the PAs, whereas mastery-oriented students learned less with a high fixation rate on the PAs. Our findings contribute to understanding how to design PAs that can better adapt to student achievement goals and visual attention to the PA.

AB  - This research addresses a significant gap in our understanding of low literate behavior in online search. We explore how both low- and high-literate online consumers make decisions at the point of purchase in an online shopping task. We measured percentage fixation duration of AOIs during decision-making on four search engine results page (SERP) tasks. Qualitative and quantitative results combined suggest that tabular SERP may contribute to the success of low literate consumers making sophisticated trade-off decisions. Furthermore, we propose that tabular SERP choice design may improve low literate user experience for more general SERP choice design.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Intelligent MultiMedia (IntelliMedia) focuses on the computer processing and understanding of signal and symbol input from at least speech, text and visual images in terms of semantic representations. We have developed a general suite of tools in the form of a software and hardware platform called “Chameleon” that can be tailored to conducting IntelliMedia in various application domains. Chameleon has an open distributed processing architecture and currently includes ten agent modules: blackboard, dialogue manager, domain model, gesture recogniser, laser system, microphone array, speech recogniser, speech synthesiser, natural language processor, and a distributed Topsy learner. Most of the modules are programmed in C and C++ and are glued together using the Dacs communications system. In effect, the blackboard, dialogue manager and Dacs form the kernel of Chameleon. Modules can communicate with each other and the blackboard which keeps a record of interactions over time via semantic representations in frames. Inputs to Chameleon can include synchronised spoken dialogue and images and outputs include synchronised laser pointing and spoken dialogue. An initial prototype application of Chameleon is an IntelliMedia Work-Bench where a user will be able to ask for information about things (e.g. 2D/3D models, pictures, objects, gadgets, people, or whatever) on a physical table. The current domain is a Campus Information System for 2D building plans which provides information about tenants, rooms and routes and can answer questions like Whose office is this? and Show me the route from Paul Mc Kevitt’s office to Paul Dalsgaard’s office. in real time. Chameleon and the IntelliMedia WorkBench are ideal for testing integrated signal and symbol processing of language and vision for the future of SuperinformationhighwayS.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Twenty qualified mission-ready F-16 pilots participated in this research. The ages of participants are between 26 and 46 years old (M=33, SD=6); total flying hours between 400 and 3,250 hours (M=1358, SD=882); F-16 type flying hours between 101 and 2,270 hours (M=934, SD=689). Eye movement data were collected by a head-mounted ASL (Applied Science Laboratory) Mobile Eye which was 76 grams in weight, combined with F-16 flight simulator, a dynamic high fidelity trainer that replicates actual aircraft performance, navigation and weapon systems. The scenario is an air-to-surface task. Participants have to intercept the proper route and turn toward the target at an altitude of 500 feet with speed of 500-KIAS, then performing a steep pop-up manoeuver to increase altitude abruptly for appropriate reconnaissance, following by dive and roll-in toward the target to avoid hostile radar lock-on. When approaching the target, subjects have to roll-out, level the aircraft, aiming at the target, release the weapon, and finally pull-up with a 5 ~ 5.5 G-force to break-away from the range. The results show significant differences in pilots’ number of gaze points among five different AOIs, F (4, 95) = 533.84, p<.001, η2ρ = .97. Further comparisons using post-hoc Bonferroni adjusted tests showed HUD has a significantly higher numbers of gaze points than ICP, DED, RMFD and LMFD; and ICP has significantly higher gaze points than DED, RMFD and LMFD. Also, there were significant differences in pilots’ number of fixation among five different AOIs, F (4, 95) = 306.98, p<.001, η2ρ =.94. Further comparisons using post-hoc Bonferroni adjusted tests showed HUD has significantly higher number of fixation than ICP, DED, RMFD and LMFD; and ICP has significantly higher number of fixations than DED, RMFD and LMFD. Pilots have to be able to ‘see and process’ the information to understand the situation, and then, to ‘project’ the situation in the near future. There is a long-standing argument concerning bottom-up or top-down visual processes in the eye movement literature. It is observed in this research that pilots applied both bottom-up and top-down visual processes, depending on the salience of information or previous experience.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Under high pressure of flight mission and dynamic aircraft maneuvers in the tactic missions, pilot faces additional difficulties and increased mental workload. Workload could increase the error of flight operation, decrease efficiency of pilot’s decision-making. Experts had significantly shorter dwells, more total fixations, more aim point and airspeed fixations and fewer altimeter fixations than novices, experts were also found to have better defined eye-scanning patterns. This research applies the eye-tracking technology for analyzing visual attention, emWave-2 for measuring physiological coherence, and NSAS-TLX for investigating subjective cognitive efforts. The participants of this research consisted of 41 fighter pilots. The present study is applying new technology to understand the pilots’ workload and visual attention in the cockpit for conducting a simulated air-to-air tactic operation. There is a raising need for further research regarding mental workload and stress management program for real-time flight operations.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Web pages are an important human-computer interface, and the layout of Web pages has an effect on visual search. This study focuses on using eye-tracking to explore the relation between information forms and locations, as well as the impact of floating advertisements (ads for short) for visual search on Web pages. The results show that for the information presented as text, the fixation duration in quadrant I (right upper), II (left upper) and III (left lower) are shorter than in quadrant IV(right lower) and the center area; for the picture, the fixation duration in quadrant II is the shortest and in quadrant III is the longest. No matter what location the information is placed on a Web page, there is no significant difference between the Web page with floating ads and without floating ads on the fixation duration, which indicates that floating ads have no significant effect on the layout of Web pages. The results suggest that the important information whether text or a picture is suitable to place in quadrant II; however, it is the worst for the layout of Web pages to arrange text information in quadrant IV and the center area or picture information in quadrant III.

SP  - 415
EP  - 428
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we show how to use the combination of eye-gaze and a touch-sensitive mouse to ease pointing tasks in graphical user interfaces. A touch of the mouse positions the mouse pointer at the current gaze position of the user. Thus, the pointer is always at the position where the user expects it on the screen. This approach changes the user experience in tasks that include frequent switching between keyboard and mouse input (e.g. working with spreadsheets). In a user study, we compared the touch-sensitive mouse with a traditional mouse and observed speed improvements for pointing tasks on complex backgrounds. For pointing task on plain backgrounds, performances with both devices were similar, but users perceived the gaze-sensitive interaction of the touch-sensitive mouse as being faster and more convenient. Our results show that using a touch-sensitive mouse that positions the pointer on the user’s gaze position reduces the need for mouse movements in pointing tasks enormously.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - One of the new design goals in Human Computer Interaction is to extend the sensory-motor capabilities of computer systems to better match the natural communication means of human beings. This article proposes a dimension space that should help reasoning about current and future Multi-Sensori-Motor systems (MSM). To do so, we adopt a system centered perspective although we draw upon the “Interacting Cognitive Subsystems” psychological model. Our problem space is comprised of 6 dimensions. The first two dimensions deal with the notion of communication channel: the number and direction of the channels that a particular MSM system supports. The other four dimensions are used to characterize the degree of built-in cognitive sophistication of the system: levels of abstraction, context, fusion/fission, and granularity of concurrency. We illustrate the discussion with examples of multimedia and multimodal systems, both MSM systems but with distinct degrees of built-in cognitive sophistication.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The brain computer interface (BCI) should be the accessibility solution “par excellence” for interactive and e-learning systems. There is a substantial tradition of research on the human electro encephalogram (EEG) and on BCI systems that are based, inter alia, on EEG measurement. We have not yet seen a viable BCI for e-learning. For many users for a BCI based interface is their first choice for good quality interaction, such as those with major psychomotor or cognitive impairments. However, there are many more for whom the BCI would be an attractive option given an acceptable learning overhead, including less severe disabilities and safety critical conditions where cognitive overload or limited responses are likely. Recent progress has been modest as there are many technical and accessibility problems to overcome. We present these issues and report a survey of fifty papers to capture the state-of-the-art in BCI and the implications for e-learning.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Through introducing the psychology model of reading cognitive, this paper uses the LSTM neural network and the CRF model respectively to simulate the language cognition process and the eye-movement control process in reading, in order to overcome the defect that the traditional CRF prediction model only considers the context information of the label sequence but can not take into account the context information of the text sequence. First, the psychological process of reading cognition is introduced and the prediction model of saccade target based on LSTM-CRF for Chinese reading is proposed. Then, the experimental data, experimental environment, feature templates and parameter settings needed for model training are introduced. Finally, the conclusion is drawn through experimental comparison: (1) The F1 score of prediction model in saccade labeling based on LSTM-CRF is superior to the traditional CRF prediction model; (2) The predictability of the language itself is an important feature of the saccade target prediction model; (3) The best saccade length for Chinese readers is about 2.5 Chinese characters.

Subjects were later asked whether they believed ad trackers were present on the site or not. 41% believed there either were or were not ad trackers on the site based on not clicking “allow” or “block”, respectively. These results suggest that a pragmatic implicature is in play - information is suggested though not explicitly stated.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - When conducting eye tracking studies, the benefits of collecting qualitative data are significant. In this paper, we propose to take qualitative data collection even further by exploring participants’ emotions and habitus during a semi-directive interview guided by the user himself. This method is part of a research on data visualization: how does the user make sense of data visualization and what is the influence of visualizations embellishment on this sense making? Since sense making can be stimulated as much by the human perceptual system as by personal experience and opinions, the methodological challenge of this research is to design an experimental protocol that considers these two dimensions. It is of great interest to combine an eye tracking study with qualitative data collection, which is intended to be both complementary and expanding. The challenge is to find the right method for collecting qualitative data when studying subjective elements. We then propose a semi-directive post-experimental interview method that will integrate all these aspects into the research.

AB  - Take bicycle industry as an example, the purpose of this research is to investigate the preference of consumer. With the using of eye-tracker, we expect to discover the relationship between preference of product form and the focus region of eye sight. With the help of eye-track technique and questionnaire research, this research aims to investigate the key design factor in bicycle design that influences customers’ preference the most. According to the physical data of eye-tracker in this research, designers could make a better inference when doing redesign. Instead of starting all over again, changing the little part of an object may have a better chance to enhance overall preference. Hence, the time spent in production and redesign will be reduced. The result shows that there is a high correlation between preference and stare duration, in addition, frame of bicycle is the part that customer consider the most when they were asked to make decision. This result advice that if designers just want to change little part of bicycle but reach a higher return, they can focus on the frame especially the top tube and the down tube.

SP  - 210
EP  - 219
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Facial trait judgments are an important information cue for people. Recent works in the Psychology field have stated the basis of face evaluation, defining a set of traits that we evaluate from faces (e.g. dominance, trustworthiness, aggressiveness, attractiveness, threatening or intelligence among others). We rapidly infer information from others faces, usually after a short period of time (< 1000ms) we perceive a certain degree of dominance or trustworthiness of another person from the face. Although these perceptions are not necessarily accurate, they influence many important social outcomes (such as the results of the elections or the court decisions). This topic has also attracted the attention of Computer Vision scientists, and recently a computational model to automatically predict trait evaluations from faces has been proposed. These systems try to mimic the human perception by means of applying machine learning classifiers to a set of labeled data. In this paper we perform an experimental study on the specific facial features that trigger the social inferences. Using previous results from the literature, we propose to use simple similarity maps to evaluate which regions of the face influence the most the trait inferences. The correlation analysis is performed using only appearance, and the results from the experiments suggest that each trait is correlated with specific facial characteristics.

AB  - Understanding and processing of information in text reading have been the core content of the reading psychological research, and it is a hot topic of great concern in cognitive science community. In this study, we used eye tracking to investigate the cognitive mechanisms during peoples reading of narratives and statistical information, and we explored the differences in behavior of people during their reading of different text information from the human cognitive behavior. This study confirmed previous view that the natural process of text reading is a dual processing process of coherent reading and focus reading, and different material characteristics might trigger different information processing activities. We found that the construction of situation model contributed to text reading, which provided some evidences for the situation model from fixation point distribution.

AB  - Chapter 2provides an overview of the latest developments in this body of work. Firstly, different approaches to the problem of measuring cognitive load are identified. The related work of each measurement approach is then discussed in more detail. These approaches include subjective (self-report) measures, physiological measures, performance measures, and behavioural measures. The related work on measuring different types of cognitive load (intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load) is also reviewed. This review also discussed how cognitive load may display variation according to factors such as gender, age, and information representational differences (e.g. static graphics versus animated graphics).

AB  - Nowadays, more and more families are willing to buy 3D TV to improve their watching experience. Stereo perception produced by watching 3D images or videos brings strong immersive watching experience to users. However, accumulated vision fatigue confuses users a lot after watching 3D TV for a long time. When watching 3D images, controlled by past recognition experience and visual attention mechanism, gaze point of two eyes is changing among different objects which have different depth of field. The eye movement in this changing process is called vergence. Vergence can be defined as movement of our eyes in opposite directions to locate the area of interest on the fovea and accommodation as alteration of the lens to obtain and maintain the area of interest focused on the fovea. So the more frequently the vergence process occurs, the more uncomfortable we feel. We expect to obtain several eye movement patterns, which can be considered as some typical visual attention patterns, by building a top-down recognition and visual attention model and then applying some clustering methods to find them. So we use an eye tracker to record eye movement data and then model it as a bayesian network model. The generative model is based on beta process and we build an Autoregression-HMM model to describe the relationship between latent eye movement patterns and eye movement data. To uncover parameters which represent different eye movement patterns in this model, we use MCMC method to calculate them with iterative computations. In this work, some different latent patterns existed in the sequential eye movement data can be revealed. After analyzing these patterns, we are able to find out some similarities and differences of visual attention models between different people watching the same image or between different images viewed by the same one. These conclusions can help to improve quality of 3D image thus lessening the users’ vision fatigue when watching 3D TV. This work also will contribute to understanding the relationship between visual attention, visual model and visual discomfort. A regression method can be applied to discover more specific conclusions in further research.

AB  - This research has adopted eye movement technique to study the influence of warning character on the information processing, which involves in two experiments. With our study, we have made our focus of research on the warning position, warning icon and warning border as a visual stimulus means. In our investigation, we have been keeping on with such commonly-made eye-movement recording parameters, such as the Fixation Count, the First Fixation and Duration by using an Eye Link II eye tracker, which is in a position to reflect the subject’s attention and conversion of the attentions. What is more, we have done a single factor variance analysis (ANOVA) in hoping to work out the experimental data due to the kinds of eye movement parameters, and the following conclusions were drawn: (1) The warning position on the warning interface affects the machining process of the warning. When the warning is embedded in text, the warning is more noticeable and the perceived hazard level is higher. (2) Consistent with the results of the relevant studies on warnings on product labels, there are also icon effects on the warning interface, and the icon can improve the salience of the warning itself and the level of perceived danger. (3) There are also border effects on the warning interface. The appearance of the border makes the warning more significant and the perceived hazard level can be improved. The research results of this paper can also be adopted as the warning message design reference, which has had a great significance in improving the identification of warning message and reducing the rate of visual accidents on interface.

AB  - Formal models of human steering behavior can enhance our understanding of perceptual and cognitive processes involved in lateral control. One such model is the two-point visual control model of steering proposed by Salvucci and Gray [8]. An experiment was conducted to test one of its central assumptions, namely that people use information coming from only two locations, a near region about 8m in front of the car and a far region 0,9s down the road, for lane keeping. 42 subjects completed a simulated driving task; road visibility was either unrestricted or reduced according to the assumptions of the two-point model. Additionally, the subjects could either freely choose where to look or had to fixate a target located in the far region. Analysis of steering precision data showed that reduced visibility did not reduce steering precision, thus lending support to the near/far region assumption of the two-point model.

AB  - Eye trackers have been routinely used in psychology reading experiments and in website usability studies for many years. However, it is only recently that they have been used by more researchers in the software engineering community. In this paper, we categorize two broad areas in which eye tracking technology can benefit software development in a practical way. The first area includes using the eye tracker as an assessment tool for software artifacts, tools, and techniques. The second area deals with using eye tracking data from developers to inform certain software tools and software development tasks such as providing developer recommendations and software traceability tasks. Examples of experiments and studies done in each of these broad areas is presented and discussed along with future work. The results point towards many benefits that eye trackers provide to augment the daily lives of programmers during software development.

AB  - The evolution of user interfaces has improved the user experience, especially the sensory features. Also, the sensory aspect is crucial for the interaction, mainly for the development of effective assistive technologies. This study presents a game for people with Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP refers to a range of clinical syndromes characterized by motor disorders and postural changes that may or may not be associated with cognitive impairment and speech disorders. Due to restricted motor condition, sports and games become difficult for people with CP. Our challenge is to offer an alternative to people with PC based on tangible and multisensory devices. The use of a robotic ball allowed remote manipulation, which makes this solution useful for people with physical disabilities. Also, an user centered design process was adopted. The game encourages people to interact by using different control devices, making it an important resource for promoting play in these users.

AB  - Understanding user experience (UX) during e-commerce has been a relatively important research area especially in the last decade. The use of conventional methods in UX such as task-observation, in-depth interviews and questionnaires has already contributed for the measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness. This empirical study has aimed to make use of both conventional and neuroscientific methods simultaneously to provide a richer analysis framework for understanding the product search experience of the first-time buyers. The current work provides insights for the results from the combined use of conventional and neuroscientific-biometric methods in a UX study. Although this has been an exploratory study within a limited literature, the obtained results indicate a potential use of these methods for UX research, which may contribute to improve the relevant experience in various digital platforms.

AB  - The automobile driving interface pictures are designed and simulated, including 4 kinds of different layout designs and 3 kinds of different color designs, which are served as the simulation system interface to implement the prototype evaluation. Tobii X2-30 screen-type eye tracker and Ergolab man-machine circular simultaneous platform system are adopted in the experiment to gather and record the users’ eye movement data. There are totally 30 participators in 20–45 years old who participated in the experiment. In the formal experiment process, the participators are required to read out the data shown on the picture. The task accomplishment time and recognition accuracy by the participators are selected to be served as the evaluation indexes. After completing the experiment, the mean searching time, mean recognition and reading time and total time are calculated. The difference on recognition and reading efficiency among single picture, pictures with different layout schemes and pictures with different colors are compared, and the influence on identification performance by coding of dashboards and colors are analyzed.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The quest to define human intelligence has led researchers down a large range of paths. One such path has been the search for a single, basic psychometric measure that can be used to account for a large portion of the variance in human mental ability. Inspection Time (IT) has emerged at the forefront of these efforts and can be shown to account for approximately 25% of the variance in psychometric tests of intelligence (e.g., IQ). In this study, we attempt to gain an insight into the nature of IT as a psychometric measure by first contrasting individuals that are adept at performing the IT task (those with low ITs) with individuals that are not (those with high ITs) using oculomotor and task-performance measures recorded during two visual tasks. The results of the first experiment show that the current prevailing theory regarding IT, the integration theory, is incapable of accounting for the results found during the visual tasks. This leads us to introduce a novel theory of IT, the watered-tree theory, which places IT as a measure of information propagation. We then perform a second experiment to test the opposing predictions of the integration theory and the watered-tree theory and find that the results are in line with the predictions of the watered-tree theory. A discussion is presented on the implications of the proposed theory and the need for its future validation.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of set deviation as a tool to characterise the deviation of a set of strings around its set median. The set deviation is defined as the set median of the positive edit sequences between any string and the set median. We show that the set deviation has the same properties as the classic second-order statistical moment. This approach is generalised to higher-order-moments of a set of strings. We then show how the set deviation can be efficiently used in well-known statistical algorithms to improve the computation of the set median of a set of strings, illustrating this concept with several examples, particularly in post-processing of texts extracted from video sequences.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Intrinsically motivated robots are machines designed to operate for long periods of time, performing tasks for which they have not been programmed. These robots make extensive use of explorative, often unstructured actions in search for opportunities to learn and extract information from the environment. Research in this field faces challenges that need advances not only on the algorithms but also on the experimental platforms. The iCub is a humanoid platform that was designed to support research in cognitive systems. We review in this chapter the chief characteristics of the iCub robot, devoting particular attention to those aspects that make the platform particularly suitable to the study of intrinsically motivated learning. We provide details on the software architecture, the mechanical design, and the sensory system. We report examples of experiments and software modules to show how the robot can be programmed to obtain complex behaviors involving the interaction with the environment. The goal of this chapter is to illustrate the potential impact of the iCub on the scientific community at large and, in particular, on the field of intrinsically motivated learning.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 219
EP  - 276
VL  - 18
IS  - 2
AB  - A family of studies investigating the impact of program identifier style on human comprehension is presented. Two popular identifier styles are examined, namely camel case and underscore. The underlying hypothesis is that identifier style affects the speed and accuracy of comprehending source code. To investigate this hypothesis, five studies were designed and conducted. The first study, which investigates how well humans read identifiers in the two different styles, focuses on low-level readability issues. The remaining four studies build on the first to focus on the semantic implications of identifier style. The studies involve 150 participants with varied demographics from two different universities. A range of experimental methods is used in the studies including timed testing, read aloud, and eye tracking. These methods produce a broad set of measurements and appropriate statistical methods, such as regression models and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), are applied to analyze the results. While unexpected, the results demonstrate that the tasks of reading and comprehending source code is fundamentally different from those of reading and comprehending natural language. Furthermore, as the task becomes similar to reading prose, the results become similar to work on reading natural language text. For more “source focused” tasks, experienced software developers appear to be less affected by identifier style; however, beginners benefit from the use of camel casing with respect to accuracy and effort.

JO  - Empirical Software Engineering
SP  - 1126
EP  - 1158
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
AB  - Software frameworks keep evolving. It is often time-consuming for developers to keep their client code up-to-date. Not all frameworks have documentation about the upgrading process. Many approaches have been proposed to ease the impact of non-documented framework evolution on developers by identifying change rules between two releases of a framework, but these change rules are imperfect, i.e., not 100 % correct. To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study to show the usefulness of these imperfect change rules. Therefore, we design and conduct an experiment to evaluate their impact. In the experiment, the subjects must find the replacements of 21 missing methods in the new releases of three open-source frameworks with the help of (1) all-correct, (2) imperfect, and (3) no change rules. The statistical analysis results show that the precision of the replacements found by the subjects with the three sets of change rules are significantly different. The precision with all-correct change rules is the highest while that with no change rules is the lowest, while imperfect change rules give a precision in between. The effect size of the difference between the subjects with no and imperfect change rules is large and that between the subjects with imperfect and correct change rules is moderate. The results of this study show that the change rules generated by framework API evolution approaches do help developers, even they are not always correct. The imperfect change rules can be used by developers upgrading their code when documentation is not available or as a complement to partial documentation. The moderate difference between results from subjects with imperfect and all-correct change rules also suggests that improving precision of change rules will still help developers.

VL  - 74
IS  - 22
AB  - Professionally edited videos entail frequent editorial cuts – that is, abrupt image changes from one frame to another. The impact of these cuts on human eye movements is currently not well understood. In the present eye-tracking study, we experimentally gauged the degree to which color and visual continuity contributed to viewers’ eye movements following cinematic cuts. In our experiment, viewers were presented with two edited action sports movies on the same screen but they were instructed to watch and keep their gaze on only one of these movies. Crucially, the movies were frequently interrupted and continued after a short break either at the same or at switched locations. Hence, viewers needed to rapidly recognize the continuation of the relevant movie and re-orient their gaze toward it. Properties of saccadic eye movements following each interruption probed the recognition of the relevant movie after a cut. Two key findings were that (i) memory co-determines attention after cuts in edited videos, resulting in faster re-orientation toward scene continuations when visual continuity across the interruption is high than when it is low, and (ii) color contributes to the guidance of attention after cuts, but its benefit largely rests upon enhanced discrimination of relevant from irrelevant visual information rather than memory. Results are discussed with regard to previous research on eye movements in movies and recognition processes. Possible future directions of research are outlined.

SP  - 1135
EP  - 1151
VL  - 21
IS  - 5
AB  - Video is increasingly used as an instructional tool. It is therefore becoming more important to improve learning of students from video. We investigated whether student learning effects are influenced through an instruction about other viewing behaviours, and whether these learning effects depend on their prior knowledge. In a controlled environment, 115 students watched a number of instructional videos about the technical equipment needed in a course on digital photography. Every second student was instructed about other possible viewing behaviours. A pre-post-retention test was carried out to calculate learning effects. The differences with respect to the learning effects of students who received an awareness instruction on an alternative viewing strategy were not significantly different. The differences as observed in our earlier experiment however could not be reproduced. Students with a broad viewing repertoire showed higher learning effects than students with a narrow repertoire. Furthermore, students with a strategic viewing approach also showed higher learning effects. Certain conditions have to be met: the technical and didactical quality of the video must be good, the integration in a learning task must be apparent, students must be aware of their viewing behaviour, and teachers must be aware of their students’ viewing behaviour in order to enrich the viewing repertoire of students when they have at least some basic knowledge e.g. after several lessons on the topics at hand. In future research, this study should be replicated using more complex video episodes than the instruction videos we used in our experiments that were only on the factual knowledge level of the taxonomy of Bloom. Moreover, replication of this study with a larger sample size could yield a significant improvement in learning effects. This is plausible because students need an amount of prior knowledge beyond a certain threshold value in order to be able to expand their knowledge network in their long term memory. Finally, additional media player functionality, facilitating effective student learning from video, can be described based on the results of this study.

SP  - 205

VL  - 20
IS  - 2
AB  - The safe and efficient operation of air traffic is highly dependent on the performance of the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO). The ATCOs control the traffic within defined areas by monitoring the traffic and granting clearances. A key element in analyzing the ATCOs is their interaction with the environment through their workplace. Especially the influence of task load on their situation awareness (SA) and applied control strategy provides information on the quality of the workplace. As task load increases, controllers are able to maintain performance by using different management or compensation strategies. This article supports the evaluation of ATCO’s workplaces by focusing on whether probe techniques for assessing SA are applicable for tower control operation and for measuring the influences of increased task load on the control strategy. An experiment with nine ATCOs was conducted in a simulated real-time air traffic control environment. Different measurements for SA were applied and compared regarding their efficiency and validity. The manipulation of task load and visibility influenced the SA and control strategy at the same time. Performance metrics were selected in advance to evaluate the participant’s efficiency. SA was measured with a probe technique and an offline self-assessment method. Findings suggest that probe techniques increase the insight into the understanding of SA in comparison to self-assessment and that they are applicable to the air traffic control environment. Control strategies were derived from the information-gathering process via the eye-movement behavior and connected to task load. The results imply that SA is part of the individual performance and that increasing demand through task load is handled with an adaptation of the control strategy.

TI  - The influences of product similarity on consumer preferences: a study based on eye-tracking analysis
JO  - Cognition, Technology & Work
AB  - Product similarity plays an important role in affecting consumer preferences. Although the existing literature discusses consumer preferences or product similarity, there are only a few studies investigating their relationship. The current study explored the influences of product similarity on consumer preferences including the underlying cognitive processes by analyzing eye movement data as well as survey data and retrospective interviews. Forty-four participants were invited to take part in the experiment. The results showed that: (1) increases in preference decision time and fixation counts are caused by a higher product similarity; (2) more fixation time is spent on the ultimately chosen options than on the rejected ones and product similarity has no impact on this phenomenon; (3) preference randomness increases with the increase of product similarity; and (4) there is a negative correlation between the mean discrepancy degree of preference rating and the mean similarity rating. Understanding the influences of product similarity on consumer preferences may contribute to better product design and sales. Further studies should quantify the effects of product features on consumer preferences with more diverse stimulus materials and more advanced technologies and methods.

TI  - The intuitive grasp interface: design and evaluation of micro-gestures on the steering wheel for driving scenario
JO  - Universal Access in the Information Society
AB  - Gestural inputs are nowadays widely applied to in-car interactive systems. The emerging sensing technologies allow for micro-gestures that can be achieved with less energy and are performed probably when the driver is grasping the steering wheel, thereby reducing the user attention to human–vehicle interaction. The movability of hands and fingers has to be considered before designing micro-gestures for driving scenarios, thus the newly defined gestures may be utterly different to the familiar multi-touch or body gestures. This paper presents a set of micro-gestures which are designed for intuitively commanding the in-car information system by taking both the gesture meanings and physical limitations into account. The study sets out the results of evaluating the feasibility of gesture sets with its performance in dual-task situation. The learnability and intuitiveness of micro-gestures as well as the effects they have on driving tasks are evaluated, and the effects of different grasping postures on the performance of novice drivers are also compared. It is concluded that the micro-gestures particularly designed for the grasp interface have advantages in multi-tasking, and they are appreciated by users who participated in the evaluation test.

EP  - 16726
VL  - 78
IS  - 12
AB  - This paper presents a region-based model based on measure of medium truth degree for image segmentation. Firstly, a new energy function based on measure of medium truth degree is constructed. To enhance the robustness against noise, a noise penalty term which is built by spatial distance measure is embedded to the conventional active contour energy function. Then local information is added to the internal and external energy term of the conventional active contour energy function to deal with intensity inhomogeneity images. Finally, to obtain more accurate and smoother boundary, a new stop function is introduced into the boundary smooth term of the conventional active contour energy function. Experiments results demonstrate that relatively complete and accurate boundaries can be obtained by the proposed model compared with the state-of-art methods on aurora images, images with intensity inhomogeneity, images with multi-objects, natural images, medical images.

JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 19

VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Social interactions entail reciprocal reactions where one’s communicative acts triggers responses in others. Fluent interpersonal exchange relies on the ability to discriminate behaviors produced by others that are responses to one’s actions, thus involving a social sense of agency. Given the pivotal role of gaze in human communication, we propose to use gaze following as a model for studying the sense of agency in social actions. The experiment investigates the influence of sensory expertise and timing of the action’s effects by comparing feedback provided by a human avatar versus a nonfigurative animated object (an arrow) and by varying the control exerted by participants’ gaze on the feedback (avatar vs arrow). Results revealed a linear relationship between the judgement of agency and feedback latencies and higher agency discriminating performances with the avatar. These outcomes suggest that classical cognitive accounts of the sense of agency can be expanded to the realm of social actions and provide important information for designing virtual agents to train social gaze interactions.

AB  - Variable selection for predictive modeling has traditionally relied on theory in the psychological domain. Given the recent advancements in computing technology and availability, researchers are able to utilize more sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques with greater ease. The challenge becomes evaluating whether theory or mathematics should be relied upon for model development. The presented analyses compared the use of hierarchical and stepwise variable selection methods during a predictive modeling task using linear regression. The results show that the stepwise variable selection method is able to obtain a more efficient model than the hierarchical variable selection method. Implications and recommendations for researchers are further discussed.

AB  - Research studies have suggested that web viewers scan websites following the F-shaped pattern starting from the top left hand side and moving towards the bottom part of the website. However, this claim is yet to be investigated carefully. The current paper reports on an eye tracking experiment conducted to compare the influence of two popular website layouts, i.e. the three column layout and the grid layout, on information search behavior, user attention and perceived usability. Sixteen participants were recruited and instructed to complete two information search tasks of varying complexity on each layout. The eye tracking metrics showed that the participants did not strictly follow the F-shaped scanning pattern. The column layout exhibited an extensive reading pattern and larger fixation densities than the grid layout. The search tasks seem to inhibit the effects of saliency and visual objects, including pictures and banner adverts, on visual attention. Moreover, participants found the search targets faster in the column layout and favored the column layout over the grid layout. Organizing content within column based web layouts expedites online reading and creates a positive user experience.

SP  - 254
EP  - 276
VL  - 27
IS  - 2
AB  - A virtual museum guide agent that uses human relationship-building behaviors to engage museum visitors is described. The computer animated agent, named “Tinker”, uses nonverbal conversational behavior, empathy, social dialogue, reciprocal self-disclosure and other relational behavior to establish social bonds with users, and encourage continued interaction and repeated visits. Tinker describes exhibits in the museum, gives directions, and discusses technical aspects of her own implementation. Tinker also recognizes returning visitors through biometric analysis of their hand shapes and dialogue cues. Results from two experiments using Tinker are described. In the first, 29 returning visitors are randomized to interact with the agent with the biometric identification turned on or off. In the second experiment, 1,607 visitors are randomized to interact with versions of Tinker that have relationship-building behavior turned on or off. Results indicate that the use of relational behavior leads to significantly greater engagement by museum visitors, measured by session length, number of sessions, and self-reported attitude, as well as learning gains, as measured by a knowledge test, compared to the same agent that does not use relational behavior. Implications for museum exhibits and intelligent tutoring systems are discussed.

TI  - ToTCompute: A Novel EEG-Based TimeOnTask Threshold Computation Mechanism for Engagement Modelling and Monitoring
JO  - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
SP  - 821
EP  - 854
VL  - 26
IS  - 3
AB  - Engagement influences participation, progression and retention in game-based e-learning (GBeL). Therefore, GBeL systems should engage the players in order to support them to maximize their learning outcomes, and provide the players with adequate feedback to maintain their motivation. Innovative engagement monitoring solutions based on players’ behaviour are needed to enable engagement monitoring in a non-disturbing way, without interrupting the game-play and game flow. Furthermore, generic metrics and automatic mechanisms for their engagement monitoring and modelling are needed. One important metric that was used for engagement modelling is TimeOnTask, which represents the duration of time required by the player to complete a task. This paper proposes ToTCompute (TimeOnTask Threshold Computation), a novel mechanism that automatically computes - in a task-dependent manner - TimeOnTask threshold values after which student engagement decreases with a given percentage from his initial level of engagement (e.g., after 2 min student engagement will fall with 10 % from his initial level). In this way the mechanism enables engagement modelling at a higher granularity and further enables engagement-based adaptation in GBeL systems. ToTCompute makes use of game-playing information and EEG signals collected through an initial testing session. The results of an experimental case study have shown that ToTCompute can be used to automatically compute threshold values for the TimeOnTask generic engagement metric, which explains up to 76.2 % of the variance in engagement change. Furthermore, the results confirmed the usefulness of the mechanism as the TimeOnTask threshold value is highly task-dependent, and setting its value manually for multiple game tasks would be a laborious process.

AB  - This chapter describes approaches that can be used to determine if systems are safe and easy to use. Examples are given from the author’s research for a variety of driver information systems, particularly warning systems, traffic information systems, and navigation displays, as well as conventional instrumentation such as speedometers. Methods are needed to provide for an early focus on users and their tasks, to provide for empirical measurement, and to support iterative design. Approaches examined include focus groups, paper and pencil studies at a driver licensing office, response time experiments, rapid prototypes using HyperCard and SuperCard, procedures involving driving simulators, and on-the-road experiments in instrumented vehicles. Simple driving simulators (task loaders) have proven to be particularly useful over the years. Application of these approaches varies with the design phase, and with the personnel, facilities, and funding available.

AB  - Alignment forms the basis of successful communication. It can be seen as the most efficient means for action coordination of cooperating agents, covering adaptation processes operating without an explicit exchange of information states. One critical condition of alignment consists of joint attention. We present work on equipping a virtual human with the capability of reaching joint attention with its human interlocutor. On the one hand, mechanisms to detect the human’s focus of attention are employed. On the other hand, basic cognitive as well as intentional processes underlying the phenomenon of joint attention are incorporated in our agent’s cognitive architecture. In this context, a dynamic working memory and a partner model accounting for theory of mind and intentionality are crucial constituents.

AB  - The diversity and complexity of Digital Musical Instruments often lead to a reduced appreciation of live performances by the audience. This can be linked to the lack of familiarity they have with the instruments. We propose to increase this familiarity thanks to a transdisciplinary approach in which signals from both the musician and the audience are extracted, familiarity analyzed, and augmentations dynamically added to the instruments. We introduce a new decomposition of familiarity and the concept of correspondences between musical gestures and results. This paper is both a review of research that paves the way for the realization of a pipeline for augmented familiarity, and a call for future research on the identified challenges that remain before it can be implemented.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Mind wandering is a ubiquitous phenomenon where attention involuntary shifts from task-related processing to task-unrelated thoughts. Mind wandering has negative effects on performance, hence, intelligent interfaces that detect mind wandering can intervene to restore attention to the current task. We investigated the use of eye gaze and contextual cues to automatically detect mind wandering during reading with a computer interface. Participants were pseudo-randomly probed to report mind wandering instances while an eye tracker recorded their gaze during a computerized reading task. Supervised machine learning techniques detected positive responses to mind wandering probes from gaze and context features in a user-independent fashion. Mind wandering was predicted with an accuracy of 72% (expected accuracy by chance was 62%) when probed at the end of a page and an accuracy of 59% (chance was 50%) when probed in the midst of reading a page. Possible improvements to the detectors and applications are discussed.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Although Situational Awareness (SA) has been an active area of research for decades, the integration of SA system frameworks specifically within the healthcare industry is a fairly new topic of interest. Recent, rapid advances in technology, especially in the field of biomedical informatics, have introduced many SA challenges; proven links between SA and patient safety warrants further studies as to identify and address the issues associated with these newly available tools. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are one of the most adopted tools in the U.S. healthcare system that perform various functions, capturing many kinds of medical data. One subset of patients that makes use of EHRs are insomnia patients. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among the general population; approximately 10% to 15% of adults in America suffer from chronic insomnia [1]. Although many researchers have tackled issues associated with EHRs including the information chaos that negatively impacts SA, none of them have measured or analyzed actual SA Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs). Developing SA MOEs for impact of EHRs on SA effectiveness for the clinician decision-making process may yield improved quality of treatment for insomnia patients.

SP  - 21073
EP  - 21115
VL  - 76
IS  - 20
AB  - Visual tracking estimates the trajectory of an object of interest in non-stationary image streams that change over time. Recently, approaches for model-free tracking have received increased interest since manually annotating sufficient examples of all objects in the world is prohibitively expensive. By definition, a model-free tracker has only one labeled instance in the form of an identified object in the first frame. In the subsequent frames, it has to learn variations of the tracked object with only unlabeled data available. There exists a dilemma for model-free trackers, i.e., whether the tracker would shift the focus to clutters (i.e., adaptivity) or result in very short tracks (i.e., stability) largely depends on how sensitive the appearance model is. In contrast to recent survey efforts with data-driven approaches focusing on the performance on benchmarks, this article aims to provide an in-depth survey on solutions to the dilemma between adaptivity and stability in model-free tracking focusing on the ability of achieving situation awareness, i.e., learning the object appearance adaptively in a non-stationary environment. The survey results show that, regardless of visual representations and statistical models involved, the way of exploiting unlabeled data in the changing environment and the extent of how rapidly the appearance model need be updated accordingly with selected example(s) of estimated labels are the key to many, if not all, evaluation measures for tracking. Such conceptual consensuses, despite the diversity of approaches in this field, for the first time capture the essence of model-free tracking and facilitate the design of visual tracking systems.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Informing a driver of a vehicle’s changing state and environment is a major challenge that grows with the introduction of in-vehicle assistant and infotainment systems. Even in the age of automation, the human will need to be in the loop for monitoring, taking over control, or making decisions. In these cases, poorly designed systems could lead to needless attentional demands imparted on the driver, taking it away from the primary driving task. Existing systems are offering simple and often unspecific alerts, leaving the human with the demanding task of identifying, localizing, and understanding the problem. Ideally, such systems should communicate information in a way that conveys its relevance and urgency. Specifically, information useful to promote driver safety should be conveyed as effective calls for action, while information not pertaining to safety (therefore less important) should be conveyed in ways that do not jeopardize driver attention. Adaptive ambient displays and peripheral interactions have the potential to provide superior solutions and could serve to unobtrusively present information, to shift the driver’s attention according to changing task demands, or enable a driver to react without losing the focus on the primary task. In order to build a common understanding across researchers and practitioners from different fields, we held a “Workshop on Adaptive Ambient In-Vehicle Displays and Interactions” at the AutomotiveUI‘15 conference. In this chapter, we discuss the outcomes of this workshop, provide examples of possible applications now or in the future and conclude with challenges in developing or using adaptive ambient interactions.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Being able to predict gaze locations, as compared to only measuring them, is desirable in many systems such as the design of web pages and commercials adaptive user interfaces, interactive visualization, or attention management systems. However, accurately predicting eye movements remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present the results of experimental study to improve the prediction of saliency maps in smart meeting rooms. More specifically, we investigate meeting scenarios in terms of their context-dependence saliency based on different image features. We have recorded the center of gaze of users in meeting rooms in different scenarios (giving a talk, listening). We then used a data-driven approach to find out which features are important in each scenario. We found that the predictions differ according to the type of features we selected. Most interestingly, we found that models trained on face features perform better than the models trained on other features in the giving a talk scenario, but in the listening scenario the models trained on competing saliency features from Itti and Koch perform better than the models trained on another features. This finding points towards including context information about the scene and situation into the computation of saliency maps as important towards developing models of eye movements, which operate well under natural conditions such as those encountered in ubiquitous computing settings.

AB  - With the availability of miniaturized low cost sensors and the general availability and easy applicability of algorithms for activity recognition, we investigate how various sensors can be deployed in a harsh environment, the industrial shop-floor. We review related work and provide an in-depth review of our own experiences were sensors wer used to enable recognition of activity, task progress and also mental and cognitive states of assembly workers. The recognition process is based on stationary (RGBD cameras, stereo vision depth sensors) and wearable devices (IMUs, GSR, ECG, mobile eye tracker). We describe in detail the used sensors, the challenges of fusing the data from these various sources together in real-time and how to interpret that data semantically.

AB  - In the medical domain, which becomes more and more digital, every improvement in efficiency and effectiveness really counts. Doctors must be able to retrieve data easily and provide their input in the most convenient way. With new technologies towards medical cyber-physical systems, such as networked head-mounted displays (HMDs) and eye trackers, new interaction opportunities arise. With our medical demo in the context of a cancer screening programme, we are combining active speech based input, passive/active eye tracker user input, and HMD output (all devices are on-body and hands-free) in a convenient way for both the patient and the doctor.

AB  - This paper presents the pilot study of a project for which the main aim is to implement an evaluation methodology service for the identification of the best locations on Cypriot web space based on eye tracking studies. Advertising budget, social demographics and web usage are some of the factors that are being considered. During this pilot study, a description in existing patterns of advertisement placement on websites is first presented. Then we present the methodologies of two pilot studies where user data are collected with the use of eye tracking technologies in order to understand how users look at Web advertising and how effective each location is as well as Marketers’ questionnaire. Stimuli were three Cypriot websites with advertisements of various types and three locations: ads being static and animated, types being skyscraper and display ads and location varied around the page. Eye-tracking data are compared to ad choices of marketing managers in Cyprus who rated the ad position and it’s attention value. Results demonstrate the correlation between user attention, advert types and the value as rated by marketers. This pilot study revealed conclusions that could form the basis towards predicting ad effectiveness of webpages with the use of ad number, location, size, and type.

AB  - As smart technologies pervade our everyday environments, they change what people should learn to live meaningfully as valuable participants of our society. For instance, ubiquitous availability of smart devices and communication networks may have reduced the burden for people to remember factual information. At the same time, they may have increased the benefits to master the uses of new digital technologies. In the midst of such a social and technological shift, we could design novel integrated platforms that support people at all ages to learn, work, collaborate, and co-create easily. In this paper, we discuss our ideas and first steps towards building an extended learning analytics platform that elderly people and unskilled adults can use. By understanding the characteristics and needs of elderly learners and addressing critical user interface issues, we can build pervasive and inclusive learning analytics platforms that trigger contextual reminders to support people at all ages to live and learn actively regardless of age-related differences of cognitive capabilities. We discuss that resolving critical usability problems for elderly people could open up a plethora of opportunities for them to search and exploit vast amount of information to achieve various goals.

AB  - Affective computing is a growing field of artificial intelligence. It focuses on models and strategies for detecting, obtaining, and expressing various affective states, including emotions, moods, and personality related attributes. The techniques and models developed in affective computing are applicable to various affective contexts, including Ambient Assisted Living. One of the hypotheses for the origin of emotion is that the primary purpose was to regulate social interactions. Since one of the crucial characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living systems is supporting social contact, it is unthinkable to build such systems without considering emotions. Moreover, the emotional capacity needed for Ambient Assisted Living systems exceeds simple user emotion detection and showing emotion expressions of the system. In addition, emotion generation and emotion mapping on rational thinking and behavior of a system should be considered. The chapter discusses the need and requirements for these processes in the context of various application domains of Ambient Assisted Living, i.e., healthcare, mobility, education, and social interaction.

AB  - This work discusses the usability experiments conducted around a proof-of-concept implementation of a novel tablet-based Digital Teaching Platform (DTP). The platform is intended to address specific issues with tablet usage in a classroom setting, and address problems with technology adoption in education, particularly in Brazil. We evaluated the DTP in two separate studies, a Usability experiment in a laboratory setting, and an in-situ experiment in Brazilian classrooms, with the aim of identifying specific problems with the current solution, and identifying usage patterns that better engage students in the classroom. We found that our DTP leads, overall, to a very satisfactory experience. However, any such platform aimed at classroom usage should take special care to address note-taking, and tasks related to collaboration, sharing, and general social aspects of the classroom experience.

BT  - Whole Body Interaction
SP  - 197
EP  - 207
PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - Since 6,000 years humans have used maps to navigate through space and solve other spatial tasks. Nearly at all times maps were drawn or printed on a piece of paper (or on material like stone or papyrus) of a certain size. Nowadays maps can be displayed on a wide range of electronic devices starting from small screen mobile devices or highly interactive large multi-touch screens. Due to common computer power Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are allowing a rich set of operations on spatial data. However, most GIS require a high degree of expertise from its users, making them difficult to be operated by laymen. In this work we discuss the possibilities of navigating maps using physical (whole body) gestures to easily perform typical basic spatial tasks within GIS (e.g. pan-, zoom- and selection-operations). We studied multi-modal interaction with large- and mid-scale displays by using multi-touch, foot and gaze input. We are interested in understanding how non-expert users interact with such multi-touch surfaces. Therefore, we provide a categorization and a framework of multi-touch hand gestures for interacting with GIS. The combination of multi-touch gestures with a small set of foot gestures to solve geospatial tasks leads to an extended framework for multi-touch and foot input. In an additional step this framework is extended again with eye gaze input.

TI  - Towards affective touch interaction: predicting mobile user emotion from finger strokes
JO  - Journal of Interaction Science
SP  - 6
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - The role of affect and emotion in interactive system design is an active and recent research area. The aim is to make systems more responsive to user’s needs and expectations. The first step towards affective interaction is to recognize user’s emotional state. Literature contains many works on emotion recognition. In those works, facial muscle movement, gestures, postures and physiological signals were used for recognition. The methods are computation intensive and require extra hardware (e.g., sensors and wires). In this work, we propose a simpler model to predict the affective state of a touch screen user. The prediction is done based on the user’s touch input, namely the finger strokes. We defined seven features based on the strokes. A linear combination of these features is proposed as the predictor, which can predict a user’s affective state into one of the three states: positive (happy, excited and elated), negative (sad, anger, fear, disgust) and neutral (calm, relaxed and contented). The model alleviates the need for extra setup as well as extensive computation, making it suitable for implementation on mobile devices with limited resources. The model is developed and validated with empirical data involving 57 participants performing 7 touch input tasks. The validation study demonstrates a high prediction accuracy of 90.47 %. The proposed model and its empirical development and validation are described in this paper.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper, we describe how eyetracking has been used in exploratory experiments to inform the design of screening tests for dyslexic students by examining their eye gaze while reading Arabic texts. Findings reveal differences in the intensity of eye gaze and reading patterns between dyslexic readers and non-dyslexic controls. Dyslexics consistently exhibited longer fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions. Moreover, results suggest that eye movement patterns are a reflection of the cognitive processes occurring during reading of texts in both Arabic deep and shallow orthographies. Applicability of eye movement analysis in investigating the nature of the reading problems and tailoring interventions to the particular needs of individuals with dyslexia is discussed.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This research offers a constitutive, mixed-method approach in order to identify trust-influencing and -influenced factors in cloud computing, which should lead to a fundamental understanding of the formation and retention of trust in cloud computing. In cloud computing, sensitive data and whole processes are transferred and outsourced to the cloud provider, without necessitating face-to-face communication with a sales assistant. We find the research methods literature review, laboratory experimental research, semi-structured expert interviews, surveys, vignettes, and (retrospective) think aloud complemented by neuroscientific methods to be suitable to reach the target set. Since vignettes, think aloud and neuroscientific methods are underrepresented or rather new to the information systems domain, in this contribution we pay special attention on these. Our mixed-method approach has the ability to verify, reaffirm, and refine theories affected by cloud computing or even to create new ones. Based on the findings of this research, recommendations for actions as well as implications for users and providers alike can be deduced. Since we rely on triangulation of the data set, the limitations of the whole approach reflect the limitations of each applied research method. Preliminary results indicate that 76% of cloud users focus primarily on data security, whereas 58% name the price of a certain cloud computing service to be relevant to provider selection.

AB  - A novel user interface (UI) design based on the personality characteristics of users was proposed and examined in a mobile learning context. It was argued that differences in personality can stimulate individuals’ information processing capabilities in according to their display preferences, thus an effective visual experience. The personality characteristics and design preferences of 87 students (37 male, and 50 female) were collected and analysed. The clustering result (using k-means algorithm) revealed two potential personality types, which we call the neuroticism and the extra-conscientiousness groups. Then, an interface was designed for each personality group using the association rules method. An eye-tracking device was used to record changes in participants’ eye-pupil diameter and fixation duration, and thus examine their cognitive load and attention. The participants’ eye movement data of each group showed that their visual experience was significantly improved when using the interface designed based on their personality characteristics. This work offers some important design and practical insights to the human–computer interaction and the design of mobile device UI.

VL  - 25

AB  - Machine translation (MT) quality is generally measured via automatic metrics, producing scores that have no meaning for translators who are required to post-edit MT output or for project managers who have to plan and budget for translation projects. This paper investigates correlations between two such automatic metrics (general text matcher and translation edit rate) and post-editing productivity. For the purposes of this paper, productivity is measured via processing speed and cognitive measures of effort using eye tracking as a tool. Processing speed, average fixation time and count are found to correlate well with the scores for groups of segments. Segments with high GTM and TER scores require substantially less time and cognitive effort than medium or low-scoring segments. Future research involving score thresholds and confidence estimation is suggested.

AB  - A mobile eye tracker was used to collect viewing behavior in a mixed reality immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) environment to evaluate a design concept of a tourist information office. The synthetic office consists of physical artifacts and virtual contents projected onto three walls of a room-sized cube. A Think Aloud study was conducted with both a goal-oriented condition and a free-browsing condition while subjects wearing the eye-tracker. Multiple Augmented Reality markers were used to reconstruct gaze positions in the coordinate system of the real environment. Gaze points were later aggregated to create heat maps, which were used as textures for a computer 3D model replication of the synthetic tourist office. The interactive visualization of the 3D heat map showcases different viewing patterns for different conditions. The insights suggest the combination of eye-tracking and mixed reality environment to be a valuable tool for prototyping service design of similar kinds.

EP  - 4834
VL  - 78
IS  - 4
AB  - This study employed an eye tracking technology to explore university students’ visual attention and learning performance while learning Japanese using an interactive manga-based e-book. The developed e-book consisted of 8 pages accompanied by 13 annotations with both text and graphical formats. The subjects consisted of 60 students whose eye movements were tracked and recorded by the eye tracking system. These students came from the applied foreign language department in a northern university in Taiwan, of which 30 were assigned to high prior knowledge (PK) group and the other 30 were assigned to low PK group. Eye tracking measurements, including total contact time, number of fixations, latency of first fixation, and number of clicks on the defined regions of interest of the two groups were compared to indicate their visual attention. The results revealed that overall students spent more time on reading text and annotation than graphic information. The high PK students showed longer fixation durations on the texts, while the low PK students showed longer fixation durations on the graphics and annotations. Meanwhile, the low PK students used more clicks to look up underlined annotations whenever they didn’t know words or phrases on the e-book. In addition, with respect to the latency of the first fixation, the graphic captured the attention faster than the text because of the size and its appeal to the students. Further analysis of saccade paths indicated that the low PK students showed more inter-scanning transitions not only between the text dialog and the annotation zone but also within annotation zone. Finally, the results of reading comprehension pretest and posttest found that there was a significant difference in learning outcomes between each PK group.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We address the statistical inference of saliency features in the images based on human eye-tracking measurements. Training videos were recorded by a head-mounted wearable eye-tracker device, where the position of the eye fixation relative to the recorded image was annotated. From the same video records, artificial saliency points (SIFT) were measured by computer vision algorithms which were clustered to describe the images with a manageable amount of descriptors. The measured human eye-tracking (fixation pattern) and the estimated saliency points are fused in a statistical model, where the eye-tracking supports us with transition probabilities among the possible image feature points. This HVS-based statistical model results in the estimation of possible tracking paths and region of interest areas of the human vision. The proposed method may help in image saliency analysis, better compression of region of interest areas and in the development of more efficient human-computer-interaction devices.

AB  - Training an object class detector typically requires a large set of images annotated with bounding-boxes, which is expensive and time consuming to create. We propose novel approach to annotate object locations which can substantially reduce annotation time. We first track the eye movements of annotators instructed to find the object and then propose a technique for deriving object bounding-boxes from these fixations. To validate our idea, we collected eye tracking data for the trainval part of 10 object classes of Pascal VOC 2012 (6,270 images, 5 observers). Our technique correctly produces bounding-boxes in 50%of the images, while reducing the total annotation time by factor 6.8× compared to drawing bounding-boxes. Any standard object class detector can be trained on the bounding-boxes predicted by our model. Our large scale eye tracking dataset is available at groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/calvin/eyetrackdataset/.

AB  - Trust in automation, and particularly maintaining an adequate level of trust in automation is now recognized as a major performance factor in supervisory control. Leveraging man-machine interaction is seen as a promising approach to influence the level of trust of an operator. Two problems need to be addressed in order to reach this goal: first measuring the level of trust; second acting on the level of trust to reach a more appropriate level. In this paper, we tackle the first problem, and propose to use a computational dialogue modelling approach to evaluate trust dynamically. We describe our model on two examples and give some perspectives.

AB  - On-line teaching situations where a tutor and their students are remote from each other mean that contact between them is reduced compared with teaching in a classroom. We report an initial study of two-way gaze sharing between a tutor and a group of students, who were in different locations. A 45-min class consisted of an introductory lecture followed by an exercise in using two software tools, one for building an experiment and the other for analysis of the data collected. The tutor went through an exercise step by step and the students followed. This was run twice with four students on each run. The tutor had a view of the students’ desktops with their gaze markers overlaid and each student had a view of the tutor’s desktop and gaze marker. Students found seeing the tutor’s gaze marker helpful during the exercise but distracting when reading the text on the lecture slides. The tutor found the view of the students’ gaze point helpful as an indicator of their current object of attention when giving assistance to individuals.

AB  - Background. Understanding the relations between user perception and aesthetics is crucial for web design. But it is frequent in today’s graphic and media design that rules, established by practitioners even before the advent of Internet and still untested empirically, are taught at design schools and widely used for online interface design. So far, there is no well-established linkage between the in-class recommendations and our empirical knowledge on usability, for which design plays a role just as crucial as web projecting. Will webpages that are better from the designers’ viewpoint perform better in terms of usability? And can one have a list of recommendations tested empirically?

AB  - In this paper we present an ultra-low cost eye gaze tracker specifically aimed at studying visual attention in 3D virtual environments. We capture camera view and user eye gaze for each frame and project vectors back into the environment to visualize where and what subjects view over time. Additionally we show one measure of calculating the accuracy in 3D space by creating vectors from the stored data and projecting them onto a fixed sphere. The ratio of hits to non-hits provides a measure of 3D sensitivity of the setup.

TI  - Ultrasound Image Representation Learning by Modeling Sonographer Visual Attention
BT  - Information Processing in Medical Imaging
SP  - 592
EP  - 604
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Image representations are commonly learned from class labels, which are a simplistic approximation of human image understanding. In this paper we demonstrate that transferable representations of images can be learned without manual annotations by modeling human visual attention. The basis of our analyses is a unique gaze tracking dataset of sonographers performing routine clinical fetal anomaly screenings. Models of sonographer visual attention are learned by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict gaze on ultrasound video frames through visual saliency prediction or gaze-point regression. We evaluate the transferability of the learned representations to the task of ultrasound standard plane detection in two contexts. Firstly, we perform transfer learning by fine-tuning the CNN with a limited number of labeled standard plane images. We find that fine-tuning the saliency predictor is superior to training from random initialization, with an average F1-score improvement of 9.6% overall and 15.3% for the cardiac planes. Secondly, we train a simple softmax regression on the feature activations of each CNN layer in order to evaluate the representations independently of transfer learning hyper-parameters. We find that the attention models derive strong representations, approaching the precision of a fully-supervised baseline model for all but the last layer.

AB  - This paper presents a user study that investigates the factors affecting student attention to user-adaptive hints during interaction with an educational computer game. The study focuses on Prime Climb, an educational game designed to provide individualized support for learning number factorization skills in the form of textual hints based on a model of student learning. We use eye-tracking data to capture user attention patterns on the game adaptive-hints and present results on how user performance, hint timing, and attitude toward getting help all affect the degree to which students attend to hints. We also show that improved attention to hints is a worthwhile goal, at least in Prime Climb, because when they are attended to hints can positively affect a student’s performance with the game.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Action recognition has traditionally focused on processing fixed camera observations while ignoring non-visual information. In this paper, we explore the dynamic properties of the movements of different body parts in natural tasks: eye, head and hand movements are quite tightly coupled with the ongoing task. In light of this, our method takes an agent-centered view and incorporates an extensive description of eye-head-hand coordination. With the ability to track the course of gaze and head movements, our approach uses gaze and head cues to detect agent-centered attention switches that can then be utilized to segment an action sequence into action units. Based on recognizing those action primitives, parallel hidden Markov models are applied to model and integrate the probabilistic sequences of the action units of different body parts. An experimental system is built for recognizing human behaviors in three natural tasks: “unscrewing a jar”, “stapling a letter” and “pouring water”, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

CY  - Cham
AB  - The purpose of the study is to explore user’s online information searching behavior via incorporating eye tracking tool with conventional user research methods and an emphasis on how eye tracking data can reveal a deeper understanding of user behaviors, specifically of interest is scan path analysis. The National Central Library (NCL) website was selected to test out two common searching tasks for libraries or library alike. And an eye-tracking device was used to detect the visual pathway. Scan path video was further used to analyze the user’s visual behavior patterns. Eight participants, four male and four female with ages from 24 to 26, were recruited for the study. A Tobii 4C eye-tracker was used to collect eye movement data and a self-developed eye-tracking data analyzer was utilized for data analysis, including fixation data and scan-path visualization. The results showed that participants who completed the task correctly had more regular and strategic searching patterns. On the opposite, participants did not find the correct answer showed no particular patterns regarding the visual path when conducting the task. The paper reported the examination of information search for the two most common inquiry on a live library website by eight Taiwanese participants in regards to search efficiency (i.e. task completion, task time, and browse pages). The paper also illustrated the additional value eye tracking tools can provide in support of user research.

AB  - In the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, the role of social media in influencing the dissemination of information is a timely and critical issue. To understand how social media-based information, misinformation, and disinformation work in practice, it is critical to identify factors that can predict social media users’ online information behavior. To this end, we designed an experiment to study the influence of the independent variables, demographics, and human values, on the dependent variables, social media users’ observed trust behavior, self-reported trust behavior, and information behavior. We report the statistically significant results of these comparisons; for example, we found that liberals were more likely to trust mainstream media (p < 0.05) and scientific journals (p < 0.05) and to state that the content of the linked pages influenced their trust (p < 0.01) than moderates; for values, we found that participants who more highly valued security were more likely to trust mainstream media articles (p < 0.05), to notice the presence or absence of hyperlinks, and to click on fake news articles (p < 0.05). Ultimately, both demographics and values can be used to predict online trust and information behavior; while demographics are commonly captured or predicted in online marketing, values represent a much less tapped opportunity to predict social media users’ online trust and information behavior.

AB  - Business process modeling can involve multiple stakeholders, so it is natural that problems may occur in building and understanding them. One way to perceive these problems is to evaluate the comprehension of these models through the collection of data related to the readers’ awareness with an eye-tracking device. This device allows collecting data of specific facial reactions of the people, such as the movement of the eyes and dilation of the pupils and the number of blinks in a specified time interval. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of researches that evaluate the understanding of process models through eye-tracking techniques. A systematic mapping study was developed to achieve this goal, following the best practices in the area of Software Engineering. This study consolidated 19 papers for the analysis and extraction of data from the 1,161 studies initially found.

AB  - Prime Climb is an educational game that provides individualized support for learning number factorization skills. This support is delivered by a pedagogical agent in the form of hints based on a model of student learning. Previous studies with Prime Climb indicated that students may not always be paying attentions to the hints, even when they are justified. In this paper we discuss preliminary work on using eye tracking data on user attention patterns to better understand if and how students process the agent’s personalized hints, with the long term goal of making hint delivery more effective.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye tracking allows us to identify visual strategies through gaze behavior, which can help us understand how students process content. Furthermore, understanding which visual strategies are successful can help us improve educational materials that foster successful use of these visual strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated the predictive value of eye tracking for student performance. Chemistry is a highly visual domain, making it particularly appropriate to study visual strategies. Eye tracking also provides measures of pupil dilation that correlate with cognitive processes important to learning, but have not yet been assessed in any realistic learning environments. We examined the gaze behavior and pupil dilation of undergraduate students working with a specialized ITS for chemistry: Chem Tutor. Chem Tutor emphasizes visual learning by focusing specifically on graphical representations. We assessed the value of over 40 high-level gaze features along with measures of pupil diameter to predict student performance and learning gains across an entire chemistry problem set. We found that certain gaze features are strong predictors of performance, but less so of learning gains, while pupil diameter is marginally predictive of learning gains, but not performance. Further studies that assess pupil dilation with higher temporal precision will be necessary to draw conclusions about the limits of its predictive power.

In this paper, we assume an environment, in which a projector presents information on the desk that is used in a transcription task such as filling a form of notification of change of address to post office. We explore the effect of the distance and the direction between the transcription target (printed) and the reference information (projected) on the efficiency and effectiveness. We confirmed that presentation on the upper sides of the transcription target and the area close to the target showed better results (faster task completion and lower error rate), while worse results were observed on the lower right side that was around the dominant hands.

AB  - Gaze-control enables people to control a computer by using eye-gaze to select items on screen. Gaze-control is a necessity for people who have lost all motor control of their body and only have control over eye movements. In addition, gaze-control can be the quickest and least tiring option for a far broader group of people with varying disabilities. This paper reports findings from gaze-control user trials involving users from both groups: people who are totally paralyzed, as well as people with a wide range of complex disabilities. The trials conducted involved four different centres supporting people with disabilities in three different European countries. Several gaze-control systems were trialled by a large number of users with varying needs and abilities. The perceived benefits of gaze-control are described, and recommendations for successful assessment and implementation of gaze-control are provided.

AB  - Understanding which characteristics of dynamic stimuli affect visual attention is crucial to usability research. We explored how object location and object luminosity differentially affect visual attention. Thirty-seven American participants viewed 34 Australian commercials, which were broken down by scene (N = 606) to identify all pertinent Areas of Interest (NAOIs = 2,695). Each AOI was subsequently coded for location and median luminosity. Luminosity was positively associated with attention capture (β = .12, p < .001), but negatively associated with sustaining attention (β = −.06, p < .000). Higher (β = .04, p < .000) or lower contrast with the immediate background (β = .03, p < .000) led to longer fixations, and central location drew visual attention (β = .49, p < .001) and sustained it (β = .19, p < .001) more than other locations. Our results show that object location and luminosity affect visual attention during dynamic stimuli, and likely influence subsequent cognitive or behavioral interaction with those objects.

CY  - Cham
AB  - The present day computers can outperform the human in many complicated tasks very precisely and efficiently. However, in many scenarios like pattern recognition and more importantly, character recognition; a school going child can outperform the sophisticated machines available today. The modern machines present today find handwritten, calligraphic text difficult to recognize because such texts hardly contain rationalized straight lines or perfect loops or circles. Therefore, most of the optical character recognition systems fail to recognize the characters beyond certain levels of distortions and noise. On the other hand, the human brain has achieved a remarkable ability to recognize visual patterns or characters in various distortion conditions with high speed. The present work tries to understand how human perceive, process and recognize the Devanagari characters under various distortion levels. In order to achieve this objective, eye tracking experiment was performed on 20 graduate participants by presenting stimuli in decreasing level of distortions (from highly distorted to more normal one). The eye fixation patterns along with the time course of recognition gave us the moment-to-moment processing involved in letter identification. Upon understanding the level of distortion acceptable for correct letter recognition and the processes involved in the identification of the letters, the OCR can be made more robust and the gap between human reading and machine reading can be narrowed down.

SP  - 403

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We study ways of automatically inferring the level of attention a user is paying to auditory content, with applications for example in automatic podcast highlighting and auto-pause, as well as in a selection mechanism in auditory interfaces. In particular, we demonstrate how the level of attention can be inferred in an unsupervised fashion, without requiring any labeled training data. The approach is based on measuring the (generalized) correlation or synchrony between the auditory content and physiological signals reflecting the state of the user. We hypothesize that the synchrony is higher when the user is paying attention to the content, and show empirically that the level of attention can indeed be inferred based on the correlation. In particular, we demonstrate that the novel method of time-varying Bayesian canonical correlation analysis gives unsupervised prediction accuracy comparable to having trained a supervised Gaussian process regression with labeled training data recorded from other users.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - An Intelligent Adaptive System (IAS) is a synergy between an intelligent interface and adaptive automation technologies capable of context sensitive interaction with operators. A well-designed IAS should enable flexible task allocation between the operator and the machine. Research suggests that the integration of real-time operator state assessment (e.g., performance, psychophysiology) can create a true ‘human-in-the-loop’ system, thereby minimizing deleterious performance effects such as overlooking automation failures and slowly reorienting to tasks. However, these research approaches apply a variety of methodologies to determine sensors, metrics, and overall system design when applied to real world tasks. This paper seeks to untangle these issues such that a more comprehensive framework for systematically evaluating the utility of cognitive state detection methods is attainable.

SP  - 99
EP  - 108
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
AB  - Interaction is the primary characteristic of a Virtual Environment and update rate is normally taken as an index or measure of the interactivity of the system. The speed of many systems is dictated by the slowest component which is often the Computer Image Generator (CIG). It is common for the workload of the CIG to vary and hence the performance of the system. This paper shows how a variable update rate can produce undesirable results. Two solutions to this problem are presented: service degradation and worst-case. In the case of the CIG, service degradation would require the quality of the image to be reduced such that the time taken never exceeds a given deadline. The worst-case technique works by finding the longest time taken to render any view and then uses that as the deadline for completion. The support of predictive methods is one of several benefits of this approach. An implementation of the worst-case technique is described which takes finer control over the CIG than usual and may be applied to many existing systems with little modification.

This is also the case when looking at APIs for configuration tasks, like for dependency injection or object-relational mapping. In these areas three different API design concepts can be found, which are annotations, fluent interfaces, and XML. There exists no research concerning usability-related characteristics and differences between these concepts.

AB  - User Interface (UI) development is a challenging task as modern UIs are expected to be available across a wide range of diverse platforms while assuring high usability for heterogeneous users. Model-driven engineering principles have been applied in the context of multi-device and cross-device UI development to tackle complexity in development. While previous work related to usability evaluation of model-driven UIs primarily focused on single- and multi-device UIs, an investigation of the usability of model-driven cross-device UIs was not fully covered yet. In this paper, therefore, we present a model-driven UI development (MDUID) approach for cross-device UIs and analyze whether the applied MDUID approach has a positive impact on the usability of the generated UI. To accomplish this, we conduct a usability evaluation based on the generated UI for a cross-channel banking web application. The usability evaluation results provide detailed feedback regarding fulfillment of different usability criteria and enable improvement of involved models as well as model transformations.

AB  - The use of information technology in mathematics education has become popular due to the increasing availability of software applications designed for constructing mathematical representations. In this study, we conducted a usability evaluation of GeoGebra, which is a commonly used math education tool that provides dynamic geometry, spreadsheet and algebra features. This study reports the findings of a usability experiment where we employed an eye tracker to evaluate the mobile version of GeoGebra. Our findings suggest that the mobile version primarily replaced the function of the mouse cursor in the desktop version with the fingertip, and did not take advantage of the gestures supported by the multi-touch screens of new generation tablet computers. Based on the empirical findings of the study, design ideas for improving the usability of the existing GeoGebra mobile interfaces are proposed.

AB  - Emerging technologies are beginning to find their way in different health care centers and clinics worldwide for the purpose of assessment and rehabilitation for people with attention deficit disorders. And due to the variation in the practitioners and patients’ requirements and preferences for using these technologies, understanding the usability issues has become essential for further development in this domain. In particular, addressing issues of selecting usability evaluation methods and their effectiveness in identifying usability problems. A bespoke heuristic set for the context of intervention programs for developing sustained attention is proposed and tested. In this study, we conducted usability heuristic evaluations on three sustained attention assessment and rehabilitation programs that involve emerging technologies; which are Neurofeedback and eye tracking. The heuristic evaluation was conducted by five evaluators, and the results showed that the proposed heuristic inspection evaluation method was effective in finding major usability problems in programs designed for sustained attention assessment and rehabilitation. Moreover, recommendations were presented regarding the evaluators’ experience with the evaluated interactive programs, the contexts of usage, target user communities, and the technical background knowledge of the interaction modalities.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The usability evaluation of published clinical guidelines (GL) on the web is an important analytical tool. This evaluation helps to determine how presentation affects GL use; it identifies the user’s needs and assesses whether the user’s perceived success rate in finding an answer is reliable or not. Such information is of great value since an inaccurate perceived success rate could lead to potentially critical consequences. This paper explores literature focusing on the usability evaluation of GL web-sites. We examine the evaluation goal, criteria and methods that researchers considered in GL website evaluation. We found that although many researchers have concentrated on the evaluation of clinical decision support systems and their usability; a problem subsists. Evaluation of the usability of published GLs on the Web and the understanding of the users’ interaction is in its infancy. Building GL websites is not substantially different than building a highly functional website with high usability in general. However, there are particular factors such as clinicians’ time constraints and information overload that need to be considered in the design of a GL website and its evaluation.

AB  - The techniques to know the visual attentions in screens by the user are used with great efficiency in the field of design to make more efficient its objective. In the educational field are few efforts made, being one of the challenges of engineering and Sciences of education to improve learning outcomes. This study aims is to know the usability of personalized, conventional and gestural interaction resources based in the patterns of visual attention of children with Down syndrome, in teaching resources based on eye-tracker validated visual attention in a classroom environment for children with Down Syndrome. Selected 6 students of the Down Tenerife Association (CG = 3, GE = 3), of which GE has previously interacted with the HCI Tango:H platform with teaching resources customized to their requirements cognitive and applied in a playful environment of teaching and learning, and the remaining with common resources in the classroom, designed by the teachers of the institution. Learning objects were presented to students by way of films on a screen, by tracking their visual attention with the help of an eye tracker and following the protocol think-aloud, focused on the attributes of ISO 9141-11: usability for Visual-Based gesture recognition: efficacy, effectiveness, learnability and satisfaction. The results were evaluated with the help of Tobbi Studio platform and subjective attributes through systematic observation, being the resources designed for the Tango:H plaque better valued than those of everyday use in the conventional classroom.

AB  - The promises of multimodal interaction to make interaction more natural, less error-prone and more enjoyable have been controversially discussed in the HCI community. On the one hand multimodal interaction is being adopted in fields ranging from entertainment to safety-critical applications, on the other hand new forms of interaction techniques (including two-handed interaction and speech) are still not in widespread use. In this paper we present results from a usability evaluation study including eye-tracking on how two mice and speech interaction is adopted by the users. Our results show evidence that two mice and speech can be adopted naturally by the users. In addition, we discuss how eye-tracking data helps to understand advantages of two-handed interaction and speech.

AB  - Usability testing with human participants is a fundamental evaluation method [Nielsen, 1993; Shneiderman, 1998]. It provides an evaluator with direct information about how people use web sites and the problems that they encounter with the sites being tested. During usability testing, participants use the site or a prototype to complete a predetermined set of tasks, while the tester or software records the results of the participants’ work. The evaluator then uses these results to determine how well the site supports users’ task completion and to derive other measures, such as the number of errors encountered and task completion time.

AB  - We present and analyze several gaze-based graphical password schemes based on recall and cued-recall of grid points; eye-trackers are used to record user’s gazes, which can prevent shoulder-surfing and may be suitable for users with disabilities. Our 22-subject study observes that success rate and entry time for the grid-based schemes we consider are comparable to other gaze-based graphical password schemes. We propose the first password security metrics suitable for analysis of graphical grid passwords and provide an in-depth security analysis of usergenerated passwords from our study, observing that, on several metrics, user-generated graphical grid passwords are substantially weaker than uniformly random passwords, despite our attempts at designing schemes to improve quality of user-generated passwords.

SP  - 581
EP  - 592
VL  - 16
IS  - 3
AB  - This paper presents a case study regarding the usability evaluation of navigation tasks by people with intellectual disabilities. The aim was to investigate the factors affecting usability, by comparing their user-Web interactions and underline the difficulties observed. For that purpose, two distinct study phases were performed: the first consisted in comparing interaction using two different search engines’ layouts (Google and SAPO) and the second phase consisted in a preliminary evaluation to analyze how users performed the tasks with the usual input devices (keyboard and mouse) and provide an alternative interface to help overcome possible interaction problems and enhance autonomy. For the latter, we compared two different interfaces: a WIMP-based one and speech-based one. The main results obtained showed that users had a better performance with Google (with a simpler layout) than with SAPO (with a complex layout), and despite displaying a good keyboard handling ability, they did not show autonomy using this input device (due to the need for reading/writing when handling this device). In this perspective, Google’s speech recognition application could indeed be considered an alternative for interaction. However, we found that the speech recognition interface is not as robust as it should be: it could be more precise and less prone to errors due to poor word pronunciation. After this two-phased study, we think we may be able to infer some recommendations to be used by developers in order to create more intuitive layouts for easy navigation regarding this group of people, and thereby facilitate digital inclusion.

AB  - This study examined a group of international doctoral students’ interactions with the recruitment web pages at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). It employed eye-tracking and exit interviews. Students performed six assigned search tasks, and their task outcomes were measured based on success, dwell time, and time-based efficiency. Time to first eye fixation and fixation counts were measured using heatmaps and Area of Interests (AOIs), respectively. The findings showed that while the students were able to use the websites and find answers to most of the search tasks, they faced challenges with the usability of these websites. The findings have implications for designing recruitment web pages that are user-centered and supportive of international doctoral students’ information needs and interaction behaviors.

We report different experiments using MVPA to master several key parameters. We found that 1) different feature selections provide similar classification accuracies with different interpretation depending on the underlying hypotheses, 2) paradigms should be created to maximize both Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and number of examples and 3) smoothing leads to opposite effects on classification depending on the spatial scale at which information is encoded and should be used with extreme caution.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is an effective tool for image representation. We applied the RSVP technique for image representation in the context of flashcard learning for children 6-8 years old. An evaluation was carried out to investigate the acceptance of RSVP modes in digital flashcard learning for the children. Two groups of children have been tested; there are children from a normal class and another group from the LINUS program class. In the evaluation, keyhole mode, shelf mode, and carousel mode were used in representation flashcard learning to give a comparison between these three modes. The highest choice between these three modes of RSVP was found. The finding shows that children from the normal class prefer to choose the carousel mode and children from the LINUS program prefer to choose the keyhole mode as a representation technique in their digital flashcard learning. This experiment provides us an early insight into use of RSVP techniques in the digital flashcard context. Future work is to conduct an experiment for more samples of users and using this technique in relation to the flashcard learning context.

AB  - Virtual reality technology allows designing of immersive virtual environment that might be used for diagnostics and treatment of persons with minor sexual preference that is ego-dystonic or is perceived as dangerous to society. We do operate with the theoretical framework that is based on sexual motivational system, which we reintroduce. The eye tracking, electroencephalography and galvanic skin response in combination with phalopletysmography – the change of penile tumescence in male users are data to be collected to distinguish between sexual arousal and stress. The bio-cybernetic loop will consist of combination of positive and negative feedback loop to diverge the scenario. The biofeedback training should allow us to shape the preference by employing biofeedback training of suppression of the arousal to previously created scenario. This procedure might allow better diagnostics and treatment. Although we have in mind individualization of scenario creates problems in comparison during diagnostic phase, and is more important in case of future therapy. The resulting adaptable GNU software will be available to partner and other interested research centers.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper we present an eye tracking study to evaluate the user experience in an interactive system with a non-linear narrative’s structure. New communication formats and exposition freedom are open by user interactions in non-lineal narratives. In order to study the user experience in this kind of systems, we designed, developed and validated an interactive system that break with the classical structure of linear narrative and focus on the non-linearity of the content analysing the perception time and psychological time. However, the user’s gaze can be a good indicator of which parts of an interface hold the user’s attention. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the eye-tracking data could be useful to provide information on user experience with the prototype. So, the non-linear narrative structure, the user experience variables and the results of the eye-tracking tests will be discussed in this work.

AB  - This paper presents methods and tools for gathering, analyzing and predicting behavior patterns. Considered both for a single user and for groups of users, behavior patterns may impact at a local and/or global level. The first part explains how to gather behaviors in various situations and how to drill from overt behaviors into deeper cognitive processes. The rationale of cognitive modeling and guidelines to perform it are provided. The second part deals with analysis methods that enable to detect behavior patterns. Bottom-up analysis based on existing data is augmented with top-down analysis based on conceptual design choices and hypotheses. The last part emphasizes the needs of data storage and data sharing in the organization. Beyond data storage and sharing, it presents the benefits of using Adaptive Business Intelligence in order to simulate and predict possible situations as well as the appropriated behavior patterns that enable to adapt.

AB  - Driving a car is a high cognitive-load task requiring full attention behind the wheel. Intelligent navigation, transportation, and in-vehicle interfaces have introduced a safer and less demanding driving experience. However, there is still a gap for the existing interaction systems to satisfy the requirements of actual user experience. Hand gesture as an interaction medium, is natural and less visually demanding while driving. This paper aims to conduct a user-study with 79 participants to validate mid-air gestures for 18 major in-vehicle secondary tasks. We have demonstrated a detailed analysis on 900 mid-air gestures investigating preferences of gestures for in-vehicle tasks, their physical affordance, and driving errors. The outcomes demonstrate that employment of mid-air gestures reduces driving errors by up to 50% compared to traditional air-conditioning control. Results can be used for the development of vision-based in-vehicle gestural interfaces.

We report lessons learned from conducting a user study that was adapted to not only evaluate usability but also several aspects of the user experience. In this study we evaluated some of the most important factors of user experience including aesthetics, emotions, meaning and value as well as naturalness. Based on these experiences we propose a set of possible improvements to enhance existing user study approaches. These improvements aim at incorporating a variety of methods to support the various aspects of user experience including all experiences before, during and after interaction with a product.

AB  - A large number of Chinese speech-impaired children and their families face long-term tough training and lack of professional speech therapists and training products. The rehabilitation experience of preschool children in the critical period of speech learning need attention. By the analysis to the traditional treatment, it shows that young children generally have difficulty in concentration. Parents worry about time-consuming, economic pressure, fatigue from training, uncontrollable children. Speech therapists concern about the problem of searching record, limitation of treatment. Accordingly, ICT-based speech training product which suits Chinese learning has been designed to improve these stakeholders’ experience. The product has interaction, gamification, professional knowledge, substitute for parents’ demonstration in part, visualization of the progress and training program. By comparing using the product in the training with the traditional way, the experience has been improved in attracting the attention of children, reducing the burden of parents, lifting participation of speech therapists.

AB  - The current study was carried out to investigate users’ preferences for different input modalities (i.e., mouse or gaze) when involved in scientific information-seeking tasks. According to the task that they had to perform (i.e., abstract opening, gaze bookmarking, or keyword highlighting), participants were randomly assigned to three different conditions. They had to carry out the same task twice with both means of interaction (i.e., mouse or gaze); input modalities were counterbalanced across participants. The findings showed that users were faster and perceived the system as more pleasant when they performed the tasks using their gaze. However, when participants controlled the system with a more familiar mouse interface, they perceived the system as more accurate, easy to use, and efficient. Future studies will evaluate how increasing users’ familiarity with alternative input modalities (i.e., gaze) can affect their perception of accuracy, easiness, and efficiency.

AB  - Users of mobile systems often simultaneously perform some other task, and multimodality tends to give them greater opportunities to do so. One goal in the design of mobile multimodal systems should therefore be the support of effective user multitasking. Previous research in several areas has made many contributions that are relevant to this goal, but some key issues require further work. Using the example of voice dialling with a mobile phone, we discuss task analyses of two voice dialling methods, showing how such analyses can help to identify possible obstacles to the simultaneous performance of voice dialling and other tasks. Detailed observations of users doing multitasking, supplemented with survey results, confirm that these analyses capture important aspects of the multitasking problem; but also that users' decisions and behaviour are strongly influenced by factors not covered by the task analyses, such as previous experience and beliefs about social acceptability. Conclusions are drawn concerning the implications of this research for design methods and for future research in support of user multitasking.

SP  - 425
EP  - 433
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - On a multitouch table, user’s interactions with 3D virtual representations of real objects should be influenced by task and their perceived physical characteristics. This article explores the development and user study of an interactive 3D application that allows users to explore virtual heritage objects on a surface device. To-date, most multitouch has focused on 2D or 2.5D systems. A user-study is reported where we analyse their multimodal behaviour – specifically how they interact on a surface device with objects that have similar properties to physical versions and the users’ associated gaze patterns with touch. The study reveals that gaze characteristics are different according to their interaction intention in terms of position and duration of visual attention. We discovered that virtual objects afford the perception of haptic attributes ascribed to their equivalent physical objects, and that differences in the summary statistics of gaze showed consistent characteristics between people and differences between natural and task based activities. An awareness of user behaviours using natural gestures can inform the design of interactive 3D applications which complements the user’s model of past experience with physical objects and with GUI interaction.

TI  - User interactions and behaviors in a large-scale online emotional support service
JO  - Social Network Analysis and Mining
SP  - 36
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Among the most important reasons why people communicate with each other is to share and support each other through emotional problems, yet most online social systems are uncomfortable or unsafe spaces for this purpose. This has led to the development of online emotional support systems, where users needing to speak to someone can anonymously connect to a crowd of trained listeners for a one-on-one conversation. Toward understanding the qualities of this emerging type of online social system, this article examines the users, conversations, and activities performed across 7 Cups, a massive, vibrant emotional support system with a community of listeners ready to help those with any number of emotional issues. The study makes intriguing insights along the worldwide adoption of the service, the need of its users to seek support from many others, a power-law effect of listener popularity, that users have a penchant to connecting to others along common interests and that a core periphery-like structure emerges among conversation networks, and identifies qualities of the system that drive user engagement and retention. We further study the words and actions of misbehaving users who have been reported on or blocked, and build a machine learning classifier able to anticipate their undesirable actions with reasonable accuracy and very low false positive rate. The qualities recovered gave insight into the user dynamics and communication structure of an online emotional support service, the features that drive engagement, and a means of identifying misbehaving users automatically.

SP  - 121
EP  - 133
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - The objective of this paper is to explore how users react to certain gestures (e.g., swipe, scroll, or tap) for certain use cases. More specifically, the goal is to explore and suggest guidelines to user experience (UX) designers when choosing gestures for specific use cases on a smartphone application. Building on the Task-technology fit theory, we are specifically interested in the degree of alignment between gestures and each mobile use case. We hypothesize that some gestures are better aligned with certain use cases because they require less cognitive effort than others. In other words, certain gestures are likely to become so natural for users that they do not have to consciously invest effort to accomplish these gestures. Likewise, we hypothesize that the emotional valence of gestures will be affected by the use case. To attain this objective, a lab-experiment was conducted with 20 participants, where cognitive load and emotional valence were measured. Results suggest that the combination of gestures and use cases have an impact on the user cognitive load and valence. These findings contribute to human-computer interaction (HCI) research by providing insights to help user experience (UX) designers select appropriate gestures.

SP  - 56

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - User Centered Design processes argue for user testing in order to assess and improve the quality of the interactive systems developed. The underlying belief is that the findings from user testing related to usability and user experience will inform the design of the interactive system in a relevant manner. Unfortunately reports from the industrial practice indicate that this is not straightforward and a lot of data gathered during user tests is hard to understand and exploit. This paper claims that injecting results from user-tests in user-tasks descriptions support the exploitation of user test results for designing the n+1 prototype. In order to do so, the paper proposes a set of extensions to current task description techniques and a process for systematically populating task models with data and analysis gathered during user testing. Beyond the already known advantages of task models, these enriched task models provide additional benefits in different phases of the development process. For instance, it is possible to go beyond standard task-model based performance evaluation exploiting real performance data from usability evaluation. Additionally, it also supports task-model based comparisons of two alternative systems. It can also support performance prediction and overall supports identification of usability problems and identifies shortcomings for user experience. The application of such a process is demonstrated on a case study from the interactive television domain.

JO  - User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction
SP  - 191
EP  - 226
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
AB  - User-adaptive visualization and explanatory visualization have been suggested to increase educational effectiveness of program visualization. This paper presents an attempt to assess the value of these two approaches. The results of a controlled experiment indicate that explanatory visualization allows students to substantially increase the understanding of a new programming topic. Furthermore, an educational application that features explanatory visualization and employs a user model to track users’ progress allows students to interact with a larger amount of material than an application which does not follow users’ activity. However, no support for the difference in short-term knowledge gain between the two applications is found. Nevertheless, students admit that they prefer the version that estimates and visualizes their progress and adapts the learning content to their level of understanding. They also use the application’s estimation to pace their work. The differences in eye movement patterns between the applications employing adaptive and non-adaptive explanatory visualizations are investigated as well. Gaze-based measures show that adaptive visualization captivates attention more than its non-personalized counterpart and is more interesting to students. Natural language explanations also accumulate a big portion of students’ attention. Furthermore, the results indicate that working memory span can mediate the perception of adaptation. It is possible that user-adaptation in an educational context provides a different service to people with different mental processing capabilities.

AB  - Forms are the ordinary medium to collect data from prospective users and indirectly build a cordial relationship with them. This communication bridge can affect the user emotional reaction, whenever a user finds an unexpected error during or submitting the form. This paper presents an empirical user emotional eXperience study on wizard form pattern (Multi Step Form). The study mainly uses both objective measures through brain wave activity (EEG) with eye tracking data and subjective measures through a self-reported metrics. Fifteen participants (N = 15) joined the experiment by filling the wizard form pattern. We manipulated the experiment by generating a sudden error at one step and grouped these experiments by their step number. We observe that the error affects the motivational emotion of group1 (got an error on the first step), the excitement emotion of group2 (got an error on the second step), the frustration emotion of group3 (got an error on the third step) and group4 (got no error). We thus argue that an error while filling or submitting a form is more emotional than technical.

AB  - BCI2000 is a general-purpose software suite designed for brain-computer interface (BCI) and related research. BCI2000 has been in development since 2000 and is currently used in close to 500 laboratories around the world. BCI2000 can provide stimulus presentation while simultaneously recording brain signals and subject responses from a number of data acquisition and input devices, respectively. Furthermore, BCI2000 provides a number of services (such as a generic data format that can accommodate any hardware or experimental setup) that can greatly facilitate research. In summary, BCI2000 is ideally suited to support investigations in the area of human-computer interfaces (HCI), in particular those that include recording and processing of brain signals. This chapter provides an overview of the BCI2000 system, and gives examples of its utility for HCI research.

AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems often require millisecond-level timing precision in order to function reliably. However, as BCI research expands to an ever-widening array of applications, including operation in real-world environments, such timing requirements will need to be relaxed. In addition, overall BCI system design must be improved in order to better disambiguate the numerous, seemingly similar, neural responses that may arise in such environments. We argue that this new area of operational BCI will require the integration of neural data with non-neural contextual variables in order to function reliably. We propose a framework in which non-neural contextual information can be used to better scope the operational BCI problem by indicating windows of time for specific analyses as well as defining probability distributions over these windows. We demonstrate the utility of our framework on a sample data set and provide discussion on many of the factors influencing performance.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the need for usability methods for game design and argue that within the level design discipline in game design there is a distinct lack of usability methods for users with low game literacy. Therefore, we propose that there is a need for guidance methods to properly accommodate players of all levels of game literacy in the game world. With the player having to spend the majority of its time in digital game environments and color being a basic component of any environment, we have decided to use color contrasts to determine whether color is suitable for player guidance. The goal of this paper is to determine whether player behavior, both in decision making and in viewing behavior, can be influenced through color contrasts.

AB  - In the project AAMS, we have developed the e-learning platform ALM for Ilias as a technical basis for research in education. ALM uses eye tracking data to analyze a learner’s gaze movement at runtime in order to adapt the learning content. As an extension to the actual capabilities of the platform, we plan to implement and evaluate a framework for advanced eye tracking analysis techniques. This framework will focus on two main concepts. The first concept allows for real-time analysis of a user’s text reading status by artificial intelligence techniques, at any point in the learning process. This extends and enriches the adaptive behavior of our platform. The second concept is an interface framework for multimedia applications to connect to any eye tracking hardware that is available at runtime to be used as a user interaction input device. Since accuracy can be an issue for low-cost eye trackers, we use an object-specific relevance factor for the detection of selectable or related content.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Human-computer interaction (HCI) design has its main focus on the needs of users, an approach known as user-centered design. Designing online courses is a field of human-computer research that integrates ubiquitous technology, cognition and design. The development of an online course is prototype-driven. Unfortunately, there is a lack of documented methods for assessing the design of a prototype course before it is presented to students. This paper should contribute to this need by proposing a method for evaluating online course designs based on eye tracking data, which can significantly help designers in analysing the public’s behavior. Some of these measures include content fixation points, gaze position, duration and blink rate. Designers can also gather data about how stressed out or relaxed the test users are, how attentive they are and how they solve problems. Affectivity can also be measured and this can be used to create a more customized environment for content acquisition and learning. In this paper we set out to: (1) describe the general methodology of using eye tracking to design and evaluate an online course prototype (2) discuss interaction design challenges related to this methodology and its limitations. In order to guide our discussion we will refer to an actual ongoing online course project about epilepsy that will be used to train schoolteachers.

The present study investigated the association between cognitive abilities and Web page complexity. Specifically, differences within simple, medium and complex Web pages were observed among the field dependent, independent and mixed cognitive groups via a task completion time with the use of the eye tracking technology. The results showed that task completion time is significantly different in medium and complex pages between the FD and FI users, while, in the simple pages, no statistical differences appeared. Furthermore, it was supported that users’ FD-I cognitive construct style can be identified using innovative techniques like eye tracking studies by analyzing users’ scan path and heat maps.

PB  - Springer International Publishing

AB  - The ColCoMa environment supports the training of workplace-oriented conflict management strategies through virtual role play. The role play relies on a web-based environment in which the participants interact through chat dialogues. Two of the participants (the parties in conflict) are human actors whereas the third role (“mediator”) is occupied by a chatbot. Our study aims at exploring the potential of eye-tracking analyses to assess the quality of cooperation in this situation. The standard assumption is that a certain “convergence” of the visual foci of attention between cooperation partners indicates better coordination and consideration of the other party. In our scenario, this assumption has to be refined by taking into account the different roles (including the role of the chatbot) and the distribution of utterances on the chat history. The eye-tracking parameters are compared to quality criteria such as successful completion of the game or richness/mutuality of the chat interactions. There are quite strong correlations on the aggregate level (taking overall eye-tracking convergence as a global parameter), yet not in terms of synchronicity between convergent eye-tracking and chat interaction. This is possibly due to the specific distribution of roles in our virtual training environment.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Recent research on self-regulated learning (SRL) includes multi-channel data, such as eye-tracking, to measure the deployment of key cognitive and metacognitive SRL processes during learning with adaptive hypermedia systems. In this study we investigated how 147 college students’ proportional learning gains (PLGs), proportion of time spent on areas of interest (AOIs), and frequency of fixations on AOI-pairs, differed based on their prior knowledge of the overall science content, and of specific content related to sub-goals, as they learned with MetaTutor. Results indicated that students with low prior sub-goal knowledge had significantly higher PLGs, and spent a significantly larger proportion of time fixating on diagrams compared to students with high prior sub-goal knowledge. In addition, students with low prior knowledge had significantly higher frequencies of fixations on some AOI-pairs, compared to students with high prior knowledge. The results have implications for using eye-tracking (and other process data) to understand the behavioral patterns associated with underlying cognitive and metacognitive SRL processes and provide real-time adaptive instruction, to ensure effective learning.

AB  - In this paper we present a methodology which was tested for using eye-tracking to record patent examiners’ visual attention during patent triage. The findings present ways that the eye-tracker can complement current metrics for evaluating information retrieval tools, as well as the ability to investigate further behaviors and actions which cannot be done by currently employed methods.

AB  - In developing a website, it is essential to test its design. For example, users may look at a certain image or text paragraph without paying attention to what designers may consider being the most essential information or the users may erroneously interpret its design and get confused. If users don’t interact with the website as designers anticipate, the design of website becomes dubious. In our eye-tracking study we invited 11 undergraduate students from an introductory chemistry course to test the usability of newly developed website on climate change. The results show that animated features draw more attention regardless of strength of relationship to content. Based on quantitative and qualitative data, we present possible recommendations how to improve the design of the website and how to enhance user’s overall experience.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Evaluations have long been missing or imperfect in a publication presenting a new visualization technique, but proper evaluations are now becoming a standard. There are many reasons for the reluctance of evaluating visualization techniques, including the complexity of the task and the amount of work required. We propose a simple evaluation approach that consists of a set of tasks carried out in an experimental setting coupled with eye tracking to approximate the focus of the user’s attention. In addition, we discuss three methods to visualize the gaze data to gain insight into the user’s attention distribution, and show examples from a study where a parallel coordinate browser was evaluated.

BT  - Business Process Management Workshops
SP  - 446
EP  - 459
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Business process models have been adopted by enterprises for more than a decade. Especially for domain experts, the comprehension of process models constitutes a challenging task that needs to be mastered when creating or reading these models. This paper presents the results we obtained from an eye tracking experiment on process model comprehension. In detail, individuals with either no or advanced expertise in process modeling were confronted with models expressed in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), reflecting different levels of difficulty. The first results of this experiment confirm recent findings from one of our previous experiments on the reading and comprehension of process models. On one hand, independent from their level of expertise, all individuals face similar patterns, when being confronted with process models exceeding a certain level of difficulty. On the other, it appears that process models expressed in terms of EPCs are perceived differently compared to process models specified in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). In the end, their generalization needs to be confirmed by additional empirical experiments. The presented experiment continues a series of experiments that aim to unravel the factors fostering the comprehension of business process models by using methods and theories stemming from the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Eye tracking can be applied to a variety of scenarios as a means of measuring visual attention and interpreting visual solution strategies. In this article, we use mobile eye-tracker to collect information to evaluate user satisfaction with the tax service office. Mobile eye tracking can collect precise information concerning the users’ visual attention and interactions in authentic environments. Unlike screen-based eye-tracker using a laboratory or stationary computer, mobile eye tracking also can be used effectively in a walk a round scene where users could walk around and interact with diverse resources. In the progress of eye tracking data analysis, fixations and gaze points, areas of interest (AOIs), heat-maps play an important role. This annotation is typically the most time-consuming step of the analysis process. To reduce processing time and human effort, we introduced the latest computer vision techniques (i.e., You Only Look Once, YOLO) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and recognize specific objects in recorded video. We propose a new method to evaluate the user satisfaction of a service system by implicating mobile eye tracker. In addition we gave a new idea of using CNN-based object detection technique to annotate video data collected by mobile eye tracker, which could be followed up for further analysis.

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been a renewed interest in capturing 21st century skills using new data collection tools. In this paper, we leverage an existing dataset where multimodal sensors (mobile eye- trackers, motion sensors, galvanic skin response wristbands) were used to identify markers of productive collaborations. The data came from 42 pairs (N = 84) of participants who had no coding experience. They were asked to program a robot to solve a variety of mazes. We explored four different measures of physiological synchrony: Signal Matching (SM), Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM), Directional Agreement (DA) and Pearson’s Correlation (PC). Overall, we found PC to be positively associated with learning gains and DA with collaboration quality. We compare those results with prior studies and discuss implications for measuring collaborative process through physiological sensors.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this paper we describe an exploratory experiment conducted in the early stages of the design and development of a screening program for non-communicative individuals. The system incorporates eye-tracking and biosensor technologies for objectively measuring affective states by combining measures of ElectroDermal Activity (EDA), temperature and eye gaze metrics of pupil dilation. The objective is to provide individuals with cognitive disabilities who experience difficulties in expressing their feelings with an alternate form of communicating their emotional states in clinical screening and occupational therapy sessions. The interactive computer-based screening program is comprised of stimuli-sets designed to elicit emotional response from viewers with a trend analysis component designed with an interface for health care providers. The focus of this paper is the feasibility of including pupil dilation as a measure reflecting affective states of individuals in the overall emotional intelligence screening system.

In collaborative software this information can be transmitted to partners in real-time to provide an additional information channel. This paper compares different types of real-time gaze data visualizations. For this purpose, a study with three groups is conducted, who have to solve a collaborative puzzle. In every group the gaze data from each participant is recorded and visualized in a different way depending on the specific group condition. The aim is to evaluate a new context-based visualization to be able to make use of the known advantages of coordinate-based gaze data visualization outside of the domain of What-You-See-Is-What-I-See (WYSIWIS) interfaces.

TI  - Using Scenarios to Validate Requirements Through the Use of Eye-Tracking in Prototyping
BT  - Augmented Cognition: Users and Contexts
SP  - 94
EP  - 104
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Research has shown that eliciting and capturing the correct behavior of systems reduces the number of defects that a system contains. A requirements engineer will model the functions of the system to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system in question. Engineers must verify the model for correctness by either having another engineer review it or build a prototype and validate with a stakeholder. However, research has shown that this form of verification can be ineffective because looking at an existing model can be suggestive and stump the development of new ideas. This paper provides an automated technique that can be used as an unbiased review of use case scenarios. Using the prototype and a scenario, a stakeholder can be guided through the use case scenario demonstrating where they expect to find the next step. Instead of measuring how many mistakes the individual makes or how long it takes them to complete the scenario, the purpose of going through the scenario with the prototype can be to capture where the individual is actually looking. Analysis of that information can be used to identify missing requirements such as interaction steps that should have alternative sequences, or determining problems with the flow of actions. The proposed approach can be used to both facilitate the further elicitation of requirements using eye-tracking techniques and validate prototypes in tandem with use case scenarios.

BT  - Persuasive Technology
SP  - 120

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Touch and speech input often exist side-by-side in multimodal systems. Speech input has a number of advantages over touch, which are especially relevant in safety critical environments such as driving. However, information on large screens tempts drivers to use touch input for interaction. They lack an effective trigger, which reminds them that speech input might be the better choice. This work investigates the efficacy of visual cues to leverage the use of speech input while driving. We conducted a driving simulator experiment with 45 participants that examined the influence of visual cues, task type, driving scenario, and audio signals on the driver’s choice of modality, glance behavior and subjective ratings. The results indicate that visual cues can effectively promote speech input, without increasing visual distraction, or restricting the driver’s freedom to choose. We propose that our results can be applied to other applications such as smartphones or smart home applications.

We examined (1) the preferences of two different LINE stickers, (2) the changes in older participation in cognition, and (3) the record of captured eye movement gaze and glance. The statistical results show a significant difference in the preferences of the two different LINE stickers. We are able to identify the unique behavior that older adults display in the user experience of LINE stickers.

Learning with computer-based educational systems relies heavily on students’ interactions, and therefore eye tracking has been used to study and improve learning. We have recently conducted several studies on using worked examples in addition to tutored problem solving. In this paper we discuss how we used eye-tracking data to compare behaviors of novices and advanced students while studying examples. We propose a new technique to analyze eye-gaze patterns named EGPA. In order to comprehend SQL examples, students require information available in the database schema. We analyzed students’ eye movement data from different perspectives, and found that advanced students paid more attention to database schema than novices. In future work, we will use the outcomes of this study to provide proactive feedback.

AB  - Business process models constitute fundamental artifacts for enterprise architectures as well as for the engineering of processes and information systems. However, less experienced stakeholders (i.e., novices) face a wide range of issues when trying to read and comprehend these models. In particular, process model comprehension not only requires knowledge on process modeling notations, but also skills to visually and correctly interpret the models. In this context, many unresolved issues concerning the factors hindering process model comprehension exist and, hence, the identification of these factors becomes crucial. Using eye-tracking as an instrument, this paper presents the results obtained of a study, in which we analyzed eye-movements of novices and experts, while comprehending process models expressed in terms of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. Further, recorded eye-movements are visualized as scan paths to analyze the applied comprehension strategies. We learned that experts comprehend process models more effectively than novices. In addition, we observed particular patterns for eye-movements (e.g., back-and-forth saccade jumps) as well as different strategies of novices and experts in comprehending process models.

AB  - We present VEDI (Vision Exploitation for Data Interpretation), an integrated system to jointly assist the visitors of cultural sites and provide meaningful statistics about the visits to the managers of the sites. To address both goals, VEDI includes a wearable assistant (implemented through a wearable device such as HoloLens) which leverages Computer Vision algorithms to understand where the user is and what they are paying attention to. At the visitor’s end, such information is leveraged to augment the visit by displaying additional information on the observed points of interest, helping the visitors to navigate the site and suggesting what to see next. Concurrently, a back-end extracts high-level behavioral information from the captured video content which is used to provide the site manager with meaningful statistics and performance indexes on the cultural site. Experiments show that VEDI achieves good results on both the indoor and outdoor cultural sites considered for the experimentation.

The navigation instruction is depicted by a virtual route object presented in an augmented reality (AR) environment. This paper discusses a pilot test of the pedestrian navigation system prototype developed on eye-tracking. An additional questionnaire shows the test subject’s mental reaction towards the system and the usability of the system itself. The evaluation of the eye-tracking pilot test allows the analysis of prominent objects in the environment and describes the relationship between reality and navigation instructions.

AB  - The main objective of the navigation system on board a High Speed Craft (HSC) is contributing to safe operation, which is supported by a high degree of situation awareness for the navigator. On the modern HSC bridge, an increasing amount of displays and support systems has been introduced, with computers being networked and integrated information presented on Multi-Function Displays (MFDs). Eye tracking data in human-computer interaction is a valuable tool to identify challenges with design and user interfaces, and to better understand the workload of the subject. This paper presents and analyse two eye tracking data sets collected to validate a mid-life update of a HSC navigation system, and outlines the challenges when collecting eye tracking data in an operational environment. Data collection with Eye Tracking Glasses (ETGs) is proven to be a valuable tool, but the quantitative data needs to be supported by qualitative data to be unambiguous.

SP  - 66
EP  - 84
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - This study validated a physiological workload tool during an investigation of information integration impacts on performance of a NASA electronic procedures task. It was hypothesized that as the level of integration of system and procedural information increased, situation awareness (SA) and usability would increase, and cognitive workload would decrease. To allow quantitative, continuous, and objective assessment of cognitive workload, Charles River Analytics designed a system for Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD). This real-time workload tool was validated against the Bedford workload rating scale in this NASA operational study. The overall results for SA and cognitive workload were mixed; however, the CAPT PICARD workload and eye tracking measures (both real-time physiological measures), showed congruous results. The value of workload assessment during developmental testing of a new system is that it allows for early identification of features and designs that result in high workload. When issues are identified early, redesigns are more feasible and less costly. Real-time workload data could provide the inputs needed to drive future adaptive displays, (e.g., if an astronaut is experiencing high cognitive workload, this data could cue an option for simplified displays). A future vision for real-time, unobtrusive measurement of workload is also to use it in an operational spaceflight environment. Therefore, it is critically important to continue to test and mature tools for unobtrusive measures of human performance like CAPT PICARD.

BT  - Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing
SP  - 170
EP  - 181
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Consideration of preference-orders requires the use of an extended rough set model called Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). The rough approximations defined within DRSA are based on consistency in the sense of dominance principle. It requires that objects having not-worse evaluation with respect to a set of considered criteria than a referent object cannot be assigned to a worse class than the referent object. However, some inconsistencies may decrease the cardinality of lower approximations to such an extent that it is impossible to discover strong patterns in the data, particularly when data sets are large. Thus, a relaxation of the strict dominance principle is worthwhile. The relaxation introduced in this paper to the DRSA model admits some inconsistent objects to the lower approximations; the range of this relaxation is controlled by an index called consistency level. The resulting model is called variable-consistency model (VC-DRSA). We concentrate on the new definitions of rough approximations and their properties, and we propose a new syntax of decision rules characterized by a confidence degree not less than the consistency level.

BT  - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics
SP  - 296

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Over 60 years of prior work has shown that an individual’s pupil diameter increases as the cognitive demands of a task increase. Recent work has also shown that resting pupil size is significantly correlated with an individual’s working memory capacity, suggesting that between subjects variation in pupil size is important. Given the importance of both within and between variations in pupil size, the present study sought to examine the reliability of pupil diameter measurements across multiple days. A longitudinal, within subjects design was used to study pupil diameter to determine if it is possible to find stable estimates of pupil diameter across several days and across time of day. This study collected pupil data using a low-cost Gazepoint GP3 HD desktop eye tracking system. Seven participants engaged in a resting luminance change task twice per day for a total of 10 days. The participants sat in a completely dark room for two minutes prior to the start of the experiment to allow their eyes to acclimate to the darkness. They then performed the resting luminance change task, as well as two other tasks omitted from analysis. This paper presents an analysis demonstrating that there are stable estimates of pupil diameter across days, as well as across time of day. These results suggest that pupil diameter is a reliable measure within individuals. The ability to reliably capture pupil diameter using low-cost eye trackers suggests that these new low cost systems may be incorporated into a broader range of cognitive research.

TI  - Vertical error correction of eye trackers in nonrestrictive reading condition
JO  - IPSJ Transactions on Computer Vision and Applications
SP  - 7
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - The eye tracking technology is used for four decades for studying reading behavior. The applications are various: estimating the reader comprehension, identifying the reader, summarizing a read document, creating a reading-life log, etc. The gaze data used in such applications has to be accurate enough to perform the analysis. In order to improve the accuracy, most of the experiments are set up with restrictive conditions such as using a head fixation and a professional eye tracker. It implies that the results are valid only in restrictive laboratory settings and an unrealistic small error is produced by the experiment. However, the use of affordable eye trackers in realistic conditions of reading leads to large errors in the recordings. We propose a new algorithm to correct the vertical error and to align the gazes with the text. The proposed algorithm is robust to rereading and skipping some parts of text, contrary to all the other algorithms of the state of the art. We show that up to 69 % of the gazes are aligned with the correct text lines.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - The paper presents an empirical study with a digital educational game (DEG) called 80Days that aims at teaching geographical content. The goal of the study is twofold: (i) investigating the potential of the eye-tracking approach for evaluating DEG; (ii) studying the issue of vicarious learning in the context of DEG. Twenty-four university students were asked to view the videos of playing two micro-missions of 80Days, which varied with regard to the position of the non-player character (NPC) window (i.e. lower right vs. upper left) and the delivery of cognitive hints (i.e. with vs. without) in this text window. Eye movements of the participants were recorded with an eye-tracker. Learning effect and user experience were measured by questionnaires and interviews. Significant differences between the pre- and post-learning assessment tests suggest that observers can benefit from passive viewing of the recorded gameplay. However, the hypotheses that the game versions with cognitive hints and with the NPC window on the upper left corner can induce stronger visual attention and thus better learning effect are refuted.

TI  - Video Saliency Modulation in the HSI Color Space for Drawing Gaze
BT  - Image and Video Technology
SP  - 206
EP  - 219
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - We propose a method for drawing gaze to a given target in videos, by modulating the value of pixels based on the saliency map. The change of pixel values is described by enhancement maps, which are weighted combination of center-surround difference maps of intensity channel and two color opponency channels. Enhancement maps are applied to each video frame in the HSI color space to increase saliency in the target region, and to decrease that in the background. The TLD tracker is employed for tracking the target over frames. Saliency map is used to control the strength of modulation. Moreover, a pre-enhancement step is introduced for accelerating computation, and a post-processing module helps to eliminate flicker. Experimental results show that this method is effective in drawing attention of subjects, but the problem of flicker may rise in minor cases.

AB  - Transmodality is the partitioning of an image into regions that are expected to present a better entropy using different coding schemes, depending on their structural density, at constant bandwidth. In this paper we present the transmodality of video stream. Our contribution is a transmoder module that includes various different optimized video codecs and implements the concept of transmodality on a set of video streams. We evaluate our proposal in the context of cloud gaming, using an optimized remote rendering chain and several games. A per game adaptation allows an optimal refinement of video encoding parameters, including both quantization and modality parameters. Our algorithm shows comprehensive results by saving up to 2 % of bandwidth for the same PSNR in comparison with the state-of-the-art video encoding baselines.

AB  - In recent years, the significant progress has been achieved in the field of visual saliency modeling. Our research key is in video saliency, which differs substantially from image saliency and could be better detected by adding the gaze information from the movement of eyes while people are looking at the video. In this paper we purposed a novel gaze saliency method to predict video attention, which is inspired by the widespread usage of mobile smart devices with camera. It is a non-contacted method to predict visual attention, and it does not bring the burden on the hardware. Our method first extracts the bottom-up saliency maps from the video frames, and then constructs the mapping from eye images obtained by the camera in synchronization with the video frames to the screen region. Finally the combination between top-down gaze information and bottom-up saliency maps is conducted by point-wise multiplication to predict the video attention. Furthermore, the proposed approach is validated on the two datasets: one is the public dataset MIT, the other is the dataset we collected, versus other four usual methods, and the experiment results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art.

SP  - 1201

VL  - 26
IS  - 9
AB  - In this work we elaborate on a novel image-based system for creating video-realistic eye animations to arbitrary spoken output. These animations are useful to give a face to multimedia applications such as virtual operators in dialog systems. Our eye animation system consists of two parts: eye control unit and rendering engine, which synthesizes eye animations by combining 3D and image-based models. The designed eye control unit is based on eye movement physiology and the statistical analysis of recorded human subjects. As already analyzed in previous publications, eye movements vary while listening and talking. We focus on the latter and are the first to design a new model which fully automatically couples eye blinks and movements with phonetic and prosodic information extracted from spoken language. We extended the already known simple gaze model by refining mutual gaze to better model human eye movements. Furthermore, we improved the eye movement models by considering head tilts, torsion, and eyelid movements. Mainly due to our integrated blink and gaze model and to the control of eye movements based on spoken language, subjective tests indicate that participants are not able to distinguish between real eye motions and our animations, which has not been achieved before.

AB  - People with cognitive impairments have problems organizing their daily life autonomously. A virtual agent as daily calendar assistant could provide valuable support, but this requires that these special user groups accept such a system and can interact with it successfully. In this paper we present studies to elucidate these questions for elderly users as well as cognitively impaired users. Results from interviews and focus groups show that acceptance can be increased by way of a participatory design method. Actual interaction studies with a prototype demonstrate the feasibility of spoken-language interaction and reveal strategies to mitigate understanding problems.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) can provide robust assessment of cognitive spatial processing skills in individuals with visual impairment. VR combined with objective measures of behavioral performance, such as eye and hand tracking, affords a high degree of experimental control, task flexibility, participant engagement, and enhanced data capture. Individuals with visual impairment typically have difficulties identifying objects in a cluttered environment. Furthermore, these difficulties may differ depending on the type of visual impairment. Specifically, individuals with cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) may show a greater sensitivity to visual task complexity compared to those with ocular based visual impairment (OVI). We have developed a VR environment with integrated eye and hand tracking to simulate exploring a toy box to assess performance on a static object-based visual search task. A grid of toys was displayed for a brief duration while participants found and fixated on a specific toy hidden among others. For a given trial, we manipulated multiple factors: the number of unique distractor toys, a color/theme matched toy, and the background clutter. Results to date show that both visually impaired groups demonstrate increased variability in search patterns and reaction times as compared to controls. Additionally, performance of the CVI group fluctuates greatly as a function of task difficulty. Findings from the current work demonstrate a successful interaction between individuals with visual impairments and VR simulations in assessing high level visual function. Further studies will serve as theoretical foundation for the creation of new assessment and training paradigms for visually impaired individuals.

AB  - Technology-enabled intervention has the potential to individualize and improve outcomes of traditional intervention. Specifically, virtual reality (VR) technology has been proposed in the virtual training of core social and communication skills that are impaired in individuals with autism. Various studies have demonstrated that children with autism have slow and atypical processing of emotional faces, which could be due to their atypical underlying neural structure. Emotional face recognition is considered among the core building blocks of social communication and early impairment in this skill has consequence on later complex language and communication skills. This work proposed a VR-based facial emotion recognition mechanism in the presence of contextual storytelling. Results from a usability study support the idea that individuals with autism may employ different facial processing strategies. The results are discussed in the context of the applicability of multimodal processing to enable adaptive VR-based systems in delivering individualized intervention.

AB  - An important real-life application domain of computer vision techniques looking at people is in developing Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems (IDAS’s). By analyzing information from both looking in and looking out of the vehicle, such systems can actively prevent vehicular accidents, improve driver safety as well as driver experience. Towards such goals, developing systems looking people in a vehicle (i.e. driver and passengers) to understand their intent, behavior, and states is needed. This is a challenging task which typically requires high reliability, accuracy, and efficient performance. Challenges also come from the dynamic background and varying lighting condition in driving scenes. However, looking at people in a vehicle also has its own characteristics which could be exploited to simplify the problem such as people typically sitting in a fixed position and their activities being highly related to the driving context. In this chapter, we give a concise overview of various related research studies to see how their approaches were developed to fit the specific requirements and characteristics of looking at people in a vehicle. From a historical point of view, we first discuss studies looking at head, eyes, and facial landmarks and then studies looking at body, hands, and feet. Despite lots of active research and published papers, developing accurate, reliable, and efficient approaches for looking at people in real-world driving scenarios is still an open problem. To this end, we will discuss some remaining issues for the future development in the area.

CY  - Cham
AB  - Human visual attention can be modulated not only by visual stimuli but also by ones from other modalities such as audition. Hence, incorporating auditory information into a human visual attention model would be a key issue for building more sophisticated models. However, the way of integrating multiple pieces of information arising from audio-visual domains still remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel computational model of human visual attention driven by auditory cues. Founded on the Bayesian surprise model that is considered to be promising in the literature, our model uses surprising auditory events to serve as a clue for selecting synchronized visual features and then emphasizes the selected features to form the final surprise map. Our approach to audio-visual integration focuses on using effective visual features alone but not all available features for simulating visual attention with the help of auditory information. Experiments using several video clips show that our proposed model can better simulate eye movements of human subjects than other existing models in spite that our model uses a smaller number of visual features.

SP  - 543

PB  - Springer London
CY  - London
AB  - In the design of interactive applications, notably games, a recent trend is to understand player behavior by investigating telemetry logs as is the focus of many chapters in this book or by integrating the use of psychophysics as is the subject of Chaps. 26 and 27. In addition to these valuable methods, measuring, where players are likely to focus, could be a very useful tool in the arsenal of game designers. This knowledge can be utilized to help game designers decide how and where to allocate computing resources, such as rendering and various kinds of simulations of physical properties. This leaves as many computing cycles as possible free to carry out other tasks. Therefore, the perceived realism of a game can be increased by perceptually optimizing calculations that are computationally intensive, including physically based lighting (e.g. ray-tracing Cater et al. 2003), animations (e.g. crowds of characters McDonnell et al. 2009), physically correct simulations of the interaction of materials (e.g. collision detection (O’Sullivan 2005), natural behavior of clothes or fluids etc.). Level of Detail variants of simulation or rendering techniques can be used in regions which are less attended by the player, while accurate simulations can be used within the expected focus of a user. Verifying or improving game mechanics and AI could be other uses.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Using an eye-tracker, this paper investigates the information that learners visually attend to in their open learner model, and the degree to which this is related to the method of displaying the model to the learner. Participants were fourteen final year undergraduate students using six views of their learner model data. Results suggest some views of the learner model information may be more likely to encourage learners to inspect information about their level of knowledge, whereas in other views attention is directed more towards scanning the view, resulting in a lower proportion of time focussed on knowledge-related data. In some views there was a difference according to whether the learner model view was one of the participants’ preferred formats for accessing their learner model information, while in other views there was little difference. This has implications for the design of open learner model views in systems opening the learner model to the learner for different purposes.

EP  - 214
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Previous eye-tracking studies of whether recipients look at speakers. gestures have yielded conflicting results but have also differed in method. This study aims to isolate the effect of the medium of presentation on recipients’ fixation behaviour towards speakers’ gestures by comparing fixations of the same gestures either performed live in a face-to-face condition or presented on video ceteris paribus. The results show that although fewer gestures are fixated on video, fixation behaviour towards gestures is largely similar across conditions. In discussing the effect of the absence of a live interlocutor vs. the projection size as a source for this reduction, we touch on some underlying mechanisms governing gesture fixations. The results are pertinent to man-machine interface issues as well as to the ecological validity of video-based paradigms needed to study the relationship between visual and cognitive attention to gestures and Sign Language.

AB  - In approaching the topic of eye tracking, we first have to consider the motivation for recording human eye movements. That is, why is eye tracking important? Simply put, we move our eyes to bring a particular portion of the visible field of view into high resolution so that we may see in fine detail whatever is at the central direction of gaze. Most often we also divert our attention to that point so that we can focus our concentration (if only for a very brief moment) on the object or region of interest. Thus, we may presume that if we can track someone’s eye movements, we can follow along the path of attention deployed by the observer. This may give us some insight into what the observer found interesting, i.e., what drew their attention, and perhaps even provide a clue as to how that person perceived whatever scene s/he was viewing.

It was observed that as long as components remained properly visible and within hand reach, the subjects were able to perform faster at a longer visual distance. We performed two additional laboratory experiments that consisted of tasks comprising of block duplication and visual peg-hole search and observed the same results. For recording the visual activity, a head-mounted binocular eye-tracker was used that captures first person view of scene along with gaze vector and fixation time. The data generated was analyzed for all three tasks and results are shown that justify our observations.

BT  - Human-Computer Interaction
SP  - 53
EP  - 74
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Display units designed for the transfer of alphanumeric information may be found to be quite different in quality. Badly designed units are not read easily and cause visual fatigue when used in long and intensive sessions. This has already received some attention (e.g., Grandjean, 1980; Padmos, this volume; Cakir, Renter, Schmude, & Ambruster, 1978; Cakir, Hart, & Stewart, 1979; Matula, 1981). It became apparent that it was important to match the physical parameters of the displays to the demands of the visual system. However, visual fatigue is known to be very difficult to measure and, consequently, is not an obvious design criterion. Looking for a more adequate measure, therefore, we surveyed other criteria based on two different angles of approach. The most direct candidate is the comfort with which a subject feels he can read the information on the screen. In principle this can be measured at least ordinally by psychometric methods. Another line of approach is the speed at which information is taken in, as reflected by performance measures like reading speed or by eye movement characteristics such as saccadic length and fixation duration.

AB  - The present chapter is an introduction to the book. The subject we propose has seen an exploded interest since last decade from research community in computer vision and multimedia indexing. From the field of video quality assessment where models of Human Visual System (HVS) were generally used to predict where humans will foveate and how will they perceive the degradation, these methods moved to classical Image and Video Indexing and retrieval tasks, recognition of objects, events, actions in images and video. In this book we try to give the most complete overview of the methods for visual information indexing and retrieval using prediction of visual attention or saliency. But also consider new approaches specifically designed for these tasks.

AB  - Eye movement recordings produce large quantities of spatio-temporal data, and are more and more frequently used as an aid to gain further insight into human thinking in usability studies in GIScience domain among others. After reviewing some common visualization methods for eye movement data, the limitations of these methods are discussed. This paper proposes an approach that enables the use of the Space-Time-Cube (STC) for representation of eye movement recordings. Via interactive functions in the STC, spatio-temporal patterns in eye movement data could be analyzed. A case study is presented according to proposed solutions for eye movement data analysis. Finally, the advantages and limitations of using the STC to visually analyze eye movement recordings are summarized and discussed.

AB  - The wide availability of digital reading material online is causing a major shift in everyday reading activities. Readers are skimming instead of reading in depth [Nielson 1997]. Highlights are increasingly used in digital interfaces to direct attention toward relevant passages within texts. In this paper, we study the eye-gaze behavior of subjects using both keyword highlighting and ScentHighlights [Chi et al. 2005]. In this first eye-tracking study of highlighting interfaces, we show that there is direct evidence of the von Restorff isolation effect [VonRestorff 1933] in the eye-tracking data, in that subjects focused on highlighted areas when highlighting cues are present. The results point to future design possibilities in highlighting interfaces.

AB  - Empirical evidence suggests that users often exhibit a viewing pattern that favors the top and left sides of web pages. This viewing pattern may cause users to miss a great deal of information. Grounded in the model of visual hierarchy, this study examines the impact of visual complexity on how users view a page. The results show that users’ viewing pattern in our study was more scattered than those reported in previous studies, which used pages with a relatively less complex visual hierarchy. We also examined the impact of browsing and information retrieval on viewing pattern. Such an investigation can provide insight for the design of homepages that can effectively serve both those who browse and those who retrieve information. The results also show that eye tracker can serve as a valuable tool for designers to develop and test new designs.

AB  - Teaching and Supervision Evaluation System (TESES), is a system to evaluate the quality of teaching and supervision from students’ perspective. It is an official student feedback system used to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of the Quality Management System (QMS) MS ISO 9001:2008 for management of undergraduate and graduate studies. In addition, the input obtained from the students will be used to continually improve and enhance the quality of teaching and learning at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Although the feedback from the system can contribute to improving the quality of the programs but the usability issues in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of the system design along with the reliability of the inputs and feedbacks from the students are disputable. Subsequently, these issues are studied in order to improve the system. This study use a triangulation method which is an integration of the three techniques; namely survey, observation through eye tracking technique and interviews, carried out on a sample consists of 30 students from the Faculty of Information Science and Technology. The visual interaction patterns, usability problems and the reliability level of student feedback are identified at the end of the study.

AB  - Visual motifs are images of visual experiences that are significant and shared across many people, such as an image of an informative sign viewed by many people and that of a familiar social situation such as when interacting with a clerk at a store. The goal of this study is to discover visual motifs from a collection of first-person videos recorded by a wearable camera. To achieve this goal, we develop a commonality clustering method that leverages three important aspects: inter-video similarity, intra-video sparseness, and people’s visual attention. The problem is posed as normalized spectral clustering, and is solved efficiently using a weighted covariance matrix. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method over several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency of visual motif discovery.

AB  - Flight activities are highly dynamic operating processes. When pilots carry out missions, the information is primarily obtained through visual search. This study applied an eye-tracking system to collect empirical and objective data of 18 qualified and in-service F-16 flight aircraft pilots executing air-to-surface tasks. The results indicate that pilots with superior flight performance exhibited a longer fixation duration and more fixation counts with more stable scanpaths and a shorter distance compared with those with inferior performance when executing air-to-surface tasks. Additionally, pilots process messages through a top-down and bottom-up composite pattern during executing tasks. Regardless of the flight experience and performance, the pilots’ pupil size exhibited an identical tendency of variation. We suggest adding the eye-tracking system to the flight-simulator platform and providing immediate feedback to pilots and the pilot’s attention allocation and cognitive abilities should be considered in training courses to enhance flight safety and improve training performance.

AB  - Disorientation has been one of the key issues hampering natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) adoption. A new Dynamic View Expansion (DVE) technique was recently introduced as a method to increase the field-of-view, as well as to provide temporal visual cues to encode the camera motion trajectory. This paper presents a systematic analysis of visual search behaviour during the use of DVE for NOTES navigation. The study compares spatial orientation and latency with and without the use of the new DVE technique with motion trajectory encoding. Eye tracking data was recorded and modelled using Markov chains to characterise the visual search behaviour, where a new region of interest (ROI) definition was used to determine the states in the transition graphs. Resultant state transition graphs formed from the participants’ eye movements showed a marked difference in visual search behaviour with increased cross-referencing between grey and less grey regions. The results demonstrate the advantages of using motion trajectory encoding for DVE.

AB  - Tag clouds have become a frequently used interaction technique in the web in the past couple of years. Research has shown the influence of variables such as tag size and location on the perception of tag clouds. However, several questions remain unclear. First, little is know on how tag clouds are perceived visually and which search strategies users apply when looking for tags in a tag cloud. Second, there are variables, especially tag location, were prior work comes to conflicting results. Third, several approaches to present tag clouds with the tags semantically clustered have been proposed recently. However, it remains unclear which effects these new approaches have on the perception of tag clouds. In this paper we report the results of an extensive study on the perception of tag clouds using eye tracking technology that allows answering these questions.

CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - Most studies about visual search on Web page focused on factors such as information form or information layout. However, there are few about information quantity. This study investigates the search strategy and information processing mode of visual search on Web pages under information overload. Results show that 1) users’ search strategies on Web pages with and without information overload are the same which is paying more attention on picture. Information overload make this picture-oriented strategy more significant. 2) Under information overload, users are more likely to use “deep search” information processing mode which is decreasing parallel processing and increasing serial processing. These results indicate that (1) information overload doesn’t change but impact users’ search strategy; (2) Information overload has a significant impact on users’ information processing mode. This study provides some evidence both for cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction, especially Web page design.

An eye tracking laboratory study with English, Chinese, and Russian participants was conducted to investigate search behavior that influenced by different category level and layout design (vertical versus horizontal). The results showed that users employed different search strategies at different levels of categories, and they showed significant differences in search patterns on different layouts. The results also indicated the impact of language on search behavior. These findings provided useful considerations for visual research in category as well as implications for the category design of multi-language e-commerce websites.

AB  - To investigate the process of reasoning with an interactive diagram, we recorded eye movements and mouse clicks of 28 users as they investigated social relationships in a 313-node network diagram. The MEgraph application used to display this network combines techniques such as topological range searching and motion highlighting to enable interactive exploration of complex network diagrams. Long-term memory encoding was assessed with a surprise recall protocol one week later, with and without lightweight visual history traces. Frequent video-game players relied more on peripheral vision, moving their gaze less often. History support was also associated with more efficient visual strategies. History traces improved users’ ability to reconstruct prior work on retest.

TI  - Visual time period analysis: a multimedia analytics application for summarizing and analyzing eye-tracking experiments
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - Recently, an increasing need for sophisticated multimedia analytics tools has been observed, which is triggered by a rapid growth of multimedia collections and by an increasing number of scientific fields embedding images in their studies. Although temporal data is ubiquitous and crucial in many applications, such tools typically do not support the analysis of data along the temporal dimension, especially for time periods. An appropriate visualization and comparison of period data associated with multimedia collections would help users to infer new information from such collections. In this paper, we present a novel multimedia analytics application for summarizing and analyzing temporal data from eye-tracking experiments. The application combines three different visual approaches: Time∘diff, visual-information-seeking mantra, and multi-viewpoint. A qualitative evaluation with domain experts confirmed that our application helps decision makers to summarize and analyze multimedia collections containing period data.

AB  - Automobiles are necessary for movement. However many people die as a result of automobile accident. Automobile accident does not decrease to at all. On the other hand, we measure a gaze point and a trial to detect person’s interest is performed. The method measuring where person looks on an image is general in traditional eye movement measuring system. But we do not understand person’s interest without image analysis in the traditional system. We propose the method directly calculating three dimensional position of interest object from person’s eye images using virtual reality system without defining two dimensional position of interest object. We register all the candidate object with interest. We propose space information rendering technique to write in direct viewpoint information at virtual space by voting for the object when person watchs an object closely. We develop a driving simulator using virtual reality of a university neighborhood driving course. A beginner driver can know the eye movement of an expert driver by applying this proposed system for an expert driver and a beginner driver.

JO  - Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces
SP  - 71
EP  - 88
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - In this paper we investigate how natural language interfaces can be integrated with cars in a way such that their influence on driving performance is being minimized. In particular, we focus on how speech-based interaction can be supported through a visualization of the conversation. Our work is motivated by the fact that speech interfaces (like Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc.) are increasingly finding their way into our everyday life. We expect such interfaces to become commonplace in vehicles in the future. Cars are a challenging environment, since speech interaction here is a secondary task that should not negatively affect the primary task, that is driving. At the outset of our work, we identify the design space for such interfaces. We then compare different visualization concepts in a driving simulator study with 64 participants. Our results yield that (1) text summaries support drivers in recalling information and enhances user experience but can also increase distraction, (2) the use of keywords minimizes cognitive load and influence on driving performance, and (3) the use of icons increases the attractiveness of the interface.

AB  - We conducted a quantitative experiment to determine the performance characteristics of non-speech vocalization for discrete input generation in comparison to existing speech and keyboard input methods. The results from the study validated our hypothesis that non-speech voice input can offer significantly faster discrete input compared to a speech-based input method by as much as 50%. Based on this and other promising results from the study, we built a prototype system called the Voice Game Controller that augments traditional speech-based input methods with non-speech voice input methods to make computer games originally designed for the keyboard and mouse playable using voice only. Our preliminary evaluation of the prototype indicates that the Voice Game Controller greatly expands the scope of computer games that can be played hands-free using just voice, to include games that were difficult or impractical to play using previous speech-based methods.

AB  - Sketch is a creative activity that anybody can start casually and often used as training to begin a full-fledged painting. Since beginners sometimes feel difficulty to draw accurate sketch, various tutoring systems of sketch have been developed. However, some problems about seeing motif object have not been solved. First, they often have difficulty to grasp the entirety of the object and fail to draw balanced sketch. Second, they have difficulty to draw exactly what they saw due to labeling of conceptual meaning. We assumed that these problems are caused by their inappropriate way of seeing motif object: an excessive focus on detail of specific part. In order to solve these problems, we proposed sketch learning support system VujaDessin. This system prompts users to see the entirety of the motif object by blurring motif image when focus on detail parts is detected. We conducted user study of the system targeting two subjects to evaluate the system effectiveness. While the system did not provide positive effect to quality of outcome, we confirmed generated blur changed users seeing behavior. The system possibly encouraged users to see entire motif object including peripheral parts in a more exploratory way. Further system development and study is required in order to support beginners who strongly feel they are not good at drawing and confirm the long-term learning effect.

AB  - We examined the function of the central visual field by using the newly developed VR system that was consisted with a wide-view HMD and an eye-tracker for restricting an arbitrary area of human visual field. Subjects were asked to walk through short virtual mazes under different visual condition in which 10 or 20 degree of their central visual field was restricted artificially with the system. Results indicated 1) Times for walking through the entire maze under the visual condition with 10 degrees of the central visual field restricted in synchronization were longer than times under the condition in which 10 degrees of the fixed central area of screen were restricted. 2) For walking through the area with two dead ends, walking times under the condition in which 20 degrees of the central visual field were restricted were longer than under the condition in which 10 degrees of the central visual field were restricted.

AB  - Experimental evidence sheds new light on the role of spatial geometry for wayfinding in real urban environments. Eye-tracking is used in a desktop-based experiment to study where people look during wayfinding decisions when let to look freely or asked to find a taxi rank. Gaze patterns from these two tasks are compared with a subsequent recall task and analyzed in light of the topology of the street grid. Results show that decisions strongly favor more connected streets, and that fixation patterns respond to the spatial geometry of the stimuli in both the spatial decision-making and recall tasks. Controls single out the impacts of lighting and affordances in both the behavioral responses and gaze bias patterns; the presence of people and traffic serve as particularly strong attractors. The paper highlights the role of spatial geometry for individual spatial decision-making in real urban environments.

AB  - Designing an interface that is both information rich and easy to search is challenging. Successfully finding a solution depends on understanding an interface’s explicit and implicit influences. A cognitively inspired computational approach is taken to make the implicit influences apparent to designers. A saliency model has already been shown to predict the deployment of attention within web page interfaces. It predicts regions likely to be salient, based on local contrast stemming from the bottom-up channels (e.g., color, orientation). This research replicates these previous findings and extends the work by proposing a web page-specific attentional priority (AP) model. This AP model includes previous interaction experience history, manifested as conventions, within the already valuable saliency model. These sources of influence automatically nudge our attention to regions that usually contain useful visual information. This research shows that, by integrating spatial conventions with a saliency model, designers can better predict the deployment of attention within web page interfaces.

AB  - Eye-tracking data provide many new options in domain of user modeling. In our work we focus on the automatic detection of web-navigation skill from eye-tracking data. We strive to gain a comprehensive view on the impact of navigation skills on addressing specific user studies and overall interaction on the Web. We proposed an approach for estimating the web navigation skill, with support of self-evaluation questionnaire. We have conducted eye-tracking study with 123 participants. Dataset from this study serves as a base for exploration analysis. We pair different web-navigation behavior metrics with result score from our questionnaire in order to find differences between participant groups. The results of the classification show that some stimuli are more appropriate than others.

AB  - Web accessibility and usability problems can make evaluation difficult for non-experts who may be unfamiliar with assistive technology. Developers often (i) lack easy access to the diversity of assistive technology employed by users, and (ii) are unaware of the different access patterns and browsing strategies that people familiar with a specific assistive technology tool might use. One way to overcome this problem is to observe a person with a disability using their tools to access content, but this can often be confusing because developers are not familiar with assistive technology and tools are not built supporting this use. In this paper we introduce WebTrax, a tool that we have developed to support developers who engage blind web users as part of their accessibility evaluation or education strategy. WebTrax helps visualize the process that screen reader users employ to access content, helping to make problems more obvious and understandable to developers.

AB  - In this paper we present a novel mechanism to obtain enhanced gaze estimation for subjects looking at a scene or an image. The system makes use of prior knowledge about the scene (e.g. an image on a computer screen), to define a probability map of the scene the subject is gazing at, in order to find the most probable location. The proposed system helps in correcting the fixations which are erroneously estimated by the gaze estimation device by employing a saliency framework to adjust the resulting gaze point vector. The system is tested on three scenarios: using eye tracking data, enhancing a low accuracy webcam based eye tracker, and using a head pose tracker. The correlation between the subjects in the commercial eye tracking data is improved by an average of 13.91%. The correlation on the low accuracy eye gaze tracker is improved by 59.85%, and for the head pose tracker we obtain an improvement of 10.23%. These results show the potential of the system as a way to enhance and self-calibrate different visual gaze estimation systems.

AB  - The main research goal is to define relevant design guidelines to implement gaze control interaction in future products. The present work describes the approach for a holistic categorization of design parameters for gaze-controlled control elements. This categorization represents the result of various studies which have been conducted at the adaptive gaze control test bench. The test bench is equipped with a remote eye tracker and a freely adaptable interface to systematically analyze the presentation and influence of defined information content and parameters through HMI. The focus of the current investigation is the gathering of further specifications of embedded design parameters divided in design parameters of the gestalt and the operating characteristic. The present studies provide further conclusions to design parameters of specific continual interaction tasks using gaze control as shown exemplary on a translational gaze-controlled virtual control element.

PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) features which quantize and count local gradient distributions in images similar to counting words in texts have proven to be powerful image representations. In combination with supervised machine learning approaches, models for nearly every visual concept can be learned. BoVW feature extraction, however, is performed by cascading multiple stages of local feature detection and extraction, vector quantization and nearest neighbor assignment that makes interpretation of the obtained image features and thus the overall classification results very difficult. In this work, we present an approach for providing an intuitive heat map-like visualization of the influence each image pixel has on the overall classification result. We compare three different classifiers (AdaBoost, Random Forest and linear SVM) that were trained on the Caltech-101 benchmark dataset based on their individual classification performance and the generated model visualizations. The obtained visualizations not only allow for intuitive interpretation of the classification results but also help to identify sources of misclassification due to badly chosen training examples.

AB  - Studies in event perception have shown that people sort ongoing experiences into neat and tidy event packages instead of unedited recordings of the world. For events unfolding along multiple tracks, there is evidence that humans impose boundaries onto them and perceive them to be one psychological entity (i.e., temporal chunking). Language users have been shown to use the differences in the beginning states of activities to describe the event sequence of simultaneous events. The current study investigated whether language users have a perceptual bias toward the beginning states while describing event sequences. Participants viewed films of simultaneous events, and described the temporal relationship of events. Throughout the experiments, their eye movements were recorded. The results did not show a compelling bias in visual attention toward the beginning boundaries. We present the findings of our eye tracking study and discuss the results in the context of the interplay between nonlinguistic and linguistic representations of events.

AB  - Stylistic analysis of artworks is an important practice in the field of Cultural Heritage. Over time, significant stylistic characteristics have been identified for paintings and sculptures, but not for historical musical instruments. Even if various stylistic features of instruments are well known, their importance for attributing an instrument to its maker remains unclear. In this work, we propose a study carried out in relation to 34 luthiers’ examinations recorded with an eye tracker. Our goal was to find which regions of a violin are most closely observed by experts during the attribution process. The retrieved data were used to create a multimedia presentation that shows a violin in the same way in which luthiers look at it. This application can be employed for knowledge dissemination (e.g,. inside museums) or as an educational tool for students of violin making schools. The experiments were carried out on a series of images of 17th-18th century historical violins kept at the “Museo del Violino” in Cremona (Italy).

EP  - 281
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Practice as research (PaR) is concerned with practice both as a method for inquiry and as evidence of the research process, producing embodied knowledge. It has been proposed that it is the foundational strategy in performative research, a kind of research apart from quantitative and qualitative research, characterized by being expressed using forms of symbolic data different from quantities or words in discursive texts. In this context, practice requires constant reflection upon itself to yield insights that can be used in a never-ending loop of creation. As practice is performed by the body and produces embodied knowledge, tools that allow querying the body during the artistic process may provide information that supports this creation/reflection loop. Previous artistic BCI applications have shown that they are suited to work as introspection tools (affective states, correlation between performed actions and area activations), as the source of raw material to be used in the creative process (raw signal, patterns of activation, band power), and as controllers for artistic instruments. We believe that previous research has laid the groundwork for the use of BCIs as tools in PaR. In this paper, we propose a framework for this and review three examples of previous artistic work using BCIs that illustrate different aspects of said framework.

EP  - 264
PB  - Springer International Publishing
CY  - Cham
AB  - Human cognitive modeling techniques and related software tools have been widely used by researchers and practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of user interface (UI) designs and related human performance. However, they are rarely used in the cyber security field despite the fact that human factors have been recognized as a key element for cyber security systems. For a cyber security system involving a relatively complicated UI, it could be difficult to build a cognitive model that accurately captures the different cognitive tasks involved in all user interactions. Using a moderately complicated user authentication system as an example system and CogTool as a typical cognitive modeling tool, this paper aims to provide insights into the use of eye-tracking data for facilitating human cognitive modeling of cognitive tasks more effectively and accurately. We used visual scan paths extracted from an eye-tracking user study to facilitate the design of cognitive modeling tasks. This allowed us to reproduce some insecure human behavioral patterns observed in some previous lab-based user studies on the same system, and more importantly, we also found some unexpected new results about human behavior. The comparison between human cognitive models with and without eye-tracking data suggests that eye-tracking data can provide useful information to facilitate the process of human cognitive modeling as well as to achieve a better understanding of security-related human behaviors. In addition, our results demonstrated that cyber security research can benefit from a combination of eye-tracking and cognitive modeling to study human behavior related security problems.

AB  - This paper introduces the AdRacer system for multifaceted testing and in-depth analyses of game effects and in-game advertising efficiency. AdRacer combines an immersive driving simulator, 3D game environment, recording of players’ gaze directions, and application of memory tests. A pilot study tested the effects of game violence on memory for brands shown as billboard ads in a racing game. In contrast to findings with TV violence, game violence did not impede brand memory. Memory results were also not mediated by visual attention during encoding. Compared to a matching nonviolent version, playing a violent game resulted in superior brand retrieval, yet participants showed fewer and shorter eye fixations on the billboard ads. Hence, caution seems to be recommended in transferring standard results from the “passive” TV medium to the interactive game medium.

VL  - 30

AB  - The amount of working memory recourses available (or required) to process a cognitive task (easy or hard) represents human cognitive effort. Working memory resources (visual or auditory) and cognitive efforts are interconnected with visual or auditory pathways. In this review, various facets of pupillary dynamics literature are compared in order to determine an optimal method of cognitive effort assessment. Some key categorical areas of interest are identified including the presented stimulus, observed response, comparisons and different methods of analysis. In details review, a set of predetermined evaluation criteria were used and a decision matrix is developed to outline the best practice in papillary dynamics. Based on the summery table in the form of the decision matrix, a quantitative model with artificial neural network (ANN) is selected for a best practice of cognitive effort estimation. The mental multiplication task is found an effective stimulus (cognitive task) to evoke the pupillary response for various level of task difficulty. In most cases, aural and visual are considered as two presentation modes, two sensory inputs, and two mental resources and greatly imparts in cognitive workload. Through this review, it is also explored that, linking together by transfer and error functions, a combination of an ANN and a multinomial processing tree can used in cognitive effort analysis. This research direction can further explored to estimate the relationship between cognitive task and cognitive effort, to facilitate in technology development for neurological disorders, such as narcolepsy, on the neural pathways involved in cognitive processing.

AB  - Within a search session users often apply different search terms, as well as different variations and combinations of them. This way, they want to make sure that they find relevant information for different stages and aspects of their information task. Research questions which arise from this search approach are: Where do users get all the ideas, hints and suggestions for new search terms or their variations from? How many ideas come from the user? How many from outside the IR system? What is the role of the used search system? To investigate these questions we used data from two experiments: first, from a user study with eye tracking data; second, from a large-scale log analysis. We found that in both experiments a large part of the search terms has been explicitly seen or shown before on the interface of the search system.

In particular, we were interested in the question of whether humans accept a synthetic agent as a genuine conversational partner that is worthy of being attended to in the same way as the human interlocutors. We concentrated on gaze behaviors as one of the most important predictors of conversational attention. Surprisingly, humans paid more attention to an agent that talked to them than to a human conversational partner. No such effect was observed in the reciprocal case, namely when humans addressed an agent as opposed to a human interlocutor.

AB  - To detect phishing mails, various strategies based on a reliable cryptography-based security framework exist. Nevertheless, the user themselves still provide a greater opportunity for phishing attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the user deals with phishing mails when confronted with them. This study limits itself to visual stimuli of phishing mails and therefore uses an eye-tracking procedure to determine the gaze behavior. Twenty-one different mails were used for this experiment, of which fourteen were phishing mails. The task of the users was to decide whether it was a phishing mail or a real mail. For the evaluation, the individual mails were provided with Areas of Interest (AOIs). This is similar to the usual components of a mail that would be attachment, body, footer, header and signature. Thereafter, three artificial groups were formed. There was one group with a low score of correct answers, one with a middle score and one with a high score. These three groups were then compared and showed differences in processing time. This led to the assumption that knowledge and time are two important factors in recognizing phishing mails.

We present four types of studies: (1) field-based human-to-human job interviews, (2) field-based computer-mediated human-to-human interviews, (3) lab-based wizard of oz studies, (4) field-based human-to-agent studies. Together, these highlight pertinent questions for the user modelling field as it expands its scope to applications for social inclusion. The results of the studies show that the interviewees suppress their emotional behaviours and although our system recognises automatically a subset of those behaviours, the modelling of complex mental states in real-world contexts poses a challenge for the state-of-the-art user modelling technologies. This calls for the need to re-examine both the approach to the implementation of the models and/or of their usage for the target contexts.

AB  - Trust seals, such as the VeriSign and TRUSTe logos, are widely used to indicate a website is reputable. But how much protection do they offer to online shoppers? We conducted a study in which 60 experienced online shoppers rated 6 websites – with and without trust seals - based on how trustworthy they perceived them to be. Eye tracking data reveals that 38% of participants failed to notice any of the trust seals present. When seals were noticed, the ratings assigned to each website were significantly higher than for the same website without a seal, but qualitative analysis of the interview data revealed significant misconceptions of their meaning (e.g. “presence of seals automatically legitimizes any website”). Participants tended to rely on self-developed – but inaccurate – heuristics for assessing trustworthiness (e.g. perceived investment in website development, or references to other recognizable entities). We conclude that trust seals currently do not offer effective protection against scam websites; and suggest that other mechanisms – such as automatic verification of authenticity are required to support consumers’ trust decisions.

AB  - Image understanding is a simple task for a human observer. Visual attention is automatically pointed to interesting regions by a natural objective stimulus in a first step and by prior knowledge in a second step. Saliency maps try to simulate human response and use actual eye-movements measurements as ground truth. An interesting question is: how much corruption in a digital image can affect saliency detection respect to the original image? One of the contributions of this work is to compare the performances of standard approaches with respect to different type of image corruptions and different threshold values on saliency maps. If the corruption can be estimated and/or the threshold is fixed, the results of this work can also be used to help in the selection of a method with best performance.

AB  - How wide should paragraphs be formatted for optimal reader retention and ease of reading? While everyone is familiar with the narrow, multi-column formatting in newspapers and magazines, research on the issue is not consistent. Early work using printed media favored narrow formatting, while more recent work using computer monitors has favored wider formatting. In this paper, we approach this issue by using eye tracking analysis of users reading material on instructional web pages. In our experimental system, subjects read the material using an instrumented browser that records all HTML content and browser actions, and their eye gaze is recorded using a nonobtrusive, “remote” eye tracker. Comparing the wide and narrow formatting conditions, our analysis shows that for narrow formatting, subjects (a) read slightly faster, (b) have fewer regressions, (c) retain more information in a post-test of the material, but (d) tend to abandon the ends of longer paragraphs.

AB  - A review of 3065 Arab e-commerce websites revealed that Web designers mostly adopt Western-influenced interface metaphors and pay scant attention to creating Arab culture-specific visual metaphors. In this research, we first collected and analyzed Arabic stories to extract themes for the creation of culturally attuned visual metaphors for use as Web interface elements. After considering various plausible themes, we specifically focused on the “wish list” metaphor as the object of our study. A subsequent eye-tracking experiment based on alternative designs of a shopping website provided evidence that participants paid more attention to the localized elements of website design. A questionnaire-based study further confirmed that localization of site design in general, and the use of culturally attuned visual metaphors in particular, gains the attention of Arab e-shoppers. The results provide both practitioners and researchers deeper insights into how culture shapes the design of websites.

AB  - Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories (LM ATL) has designed and developed a tool called Sensor-based Mental Assessment in Real Time (SMART), which uses physiological data to help evaluate human-computer interfaces (HCI). SMART non-intrusively collects and displays objective measures of cognitive workload, visual engagement, distraction and drowsiness while participants interact with HCIs or HCI prototypes. This paper describes a concept validation experiment (CVE) conducted to 1) demonstrate the feasibility of using SMART during user interface evaluations and 2) validate the EEG-based cognitive workload values derived from the SMART system by comparing them to three other measures of cognitive workload (NASA TLX, expert ratings, and expected workload values generated with Design Interactive’s Multimodal Information Decision Support tool). Results from the CVE indicate that SMART represents a valuable tool that provides human factors engineers with a non-invasive, non-interrupting, objective method of evaluating cognitive workload.

AB  - Computational visual attention is a hot topic in computer vision. However, most efforts are devoted to model saliency, whilst the actual eye guidance problem, which brings into play the sequence of gaze shifts characterising overt attention, is overlooked. Further, in those cases where the generation of gaze behaviour is considered, stimuli of interest are by and large static (still images) rather than dynamic ones (videos). Under such circumstances, the work described in this note has a twofold aim: (i) addressing the problem of estimating and generating visual scan paths, that is the sequences of gaze shifts over videos; (ii) investigating the effectiveness in scan path generation offered by features dynamically learned on the base of human observers attention dynamics as opposed to bottom-up derived features. To such end a probabilistic model is proposed. By using a publicly available dataset, our approach is compared against a model of scan path simulation that does not rely on a learning step.

BT  - Computer Vision — ECCV '96
SP  - 507
EP  - 517
PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg
CY  - Berlin, Heidelberg
AB  - In this article, we describe X Vision, a modular, portable framework for visual tracking. X Vision is designed to be a programming environment for real-time vision which provides high performance on standard workstations outfitted with a simple digitizer. X Vision consists of a small set of image-level tracking primitives and a framework for combining tracking primitives to form complex tracking systems. Efficiency and robustness are achieved by propagating geometric and temporal constraints to the feature detection level, where image warping and specialized image processing are combined to perform feature detection quickly and robustly. We illustrate how useful, robust tracking systems can be constructed by simple combinations of a few basic primitives with the appropriate task-specific constraints.

PB  - Springer Berlin Heidelberg

AB  - For the first interactive Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, the Maryland team focused on comparison of term-for-term gloss translation with full machine translation for the document selection task. The results show that (1) searchers are able to make relevance judgments with translations from either approach, and (2) the machine translation system achieved better effectiveness than the gloss translation strategy that we tried, although the difference is not statistically significant. It was noted that the “somewhat relevant” category was used differently by searchers presented with gloss translations than with machine translations, and some reasons for that difference are suggested. Finally, the results suggest that the F measure used in this evaluation is better suited for use with topics that have many known relevant documents than those with few.

AB  - This study aims at investigating which cues teachers detect and process from their students during instruction. This information capturing process depends on teachers’ sensitivity, or awareness, to students’ needs, which has been recognized as crucial for classroom management. We recorded the gaze behaviors of two pre-service teachers and two experienced teachers during a whole math lesson in primary classrooms. Thanks to a simple Learning Analytics interface, the data analysis reports, firstly, which were the most often tracked students, in relation with their classroom behavior and performance; secondly, which relationships exist between teachers’ attentional frequency distribution and lability, and the overall classroom climate they promote, measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System. Results show that participants’ gaze patterns are mainly related to their experience. Learning Analytics use cases are eventually presented, enabling researchers or teacher trainers to further explore the eye-tracking data.

AB  - With the improvement of computer capability and the development of visualization technology, dynamic visualization could be displayed smoothly. However, the span limitation of human’s working memory is a natural barrier to obtain the massive information in parallel. Here, we designed a simple psychological experiment to validate the necessity of the halt in the dynamic visualization. In this 2 × 2 between-subjects design test, 21 graduate students participated in the control group and experimental group respectively to compare the influence of the halt in the visualization under the conditions of the simple search task and the complex search task. The eye movement data of number of fixation points and total fixation duration of each single material were recorded to investigate the real-time cognitive load. The results showed that the performance improved significantly when the halt added in the complex search task, along with the real-time workload reduced. However, the performance and cognitive load have no significant change in the simple search task. It demonstrated the need for the appropriate halt in the complex data visualization.

AB  - Popular movies such as Rain Man, A Beautiful Mind and The Imitation Game often depicting the leading characters with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with exceptional math skills (referred to as autistic savants) which is largely inconsistent with research; in fact, only 10% of individuals with ASD have such savant skills; instead, prior studies showed that during their middle school years, students with ASD usually under-perform an average of 5 years below their neuro-typically developing (NT) peers in mathematics. Plausible explanation of such a gap is attributed to the population’s impairments of memory and cognitive development which in turn might undermine their learning abilities in one or more mathematical domains. Our present study aims to compare the effects of three different presentation styles during the training for children with ASD’s mathematical skills (image-based, mathematical digit-based and audio-based ones) through the behavioral analysis and eye-tracking technology. Together with their actual performance in a small-scale pilot test, these data can provide clues to the questions we raised.

In this paper, we present findings from a user study involving students interacting with an ITS, focusing on when students express excitement, what we dub “yes!” moments. These findings include an empirically-based user model that relies on both interaction and physiological sensor features to predict “yes!” events; here we describe this model, its validation, and initial indicators of its importance for understanding and fostering student interest.
